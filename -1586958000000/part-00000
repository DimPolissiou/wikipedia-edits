This can be seen through a loss of [[biomass]], a loss of actual productivity or in potential productivity, or a loss or change in [[vegetative cover]] and [[soil nutrient]]s.\n#Action in the land's capacity to provide resources for human livelihoods. This can be measured from a base line of past land use.\n#Loss of [[biodiversity]]: A loss of range of species or ecosystem complexity as a decline in the environmental quality.\n#Shifting ecological risk: increased vulnerability of the environment or people to destruction or crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction.\n\nA problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting [[crop]]s at a location with heavy [[rainfall]] and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of [[Soil erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]], yet  farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high [[crop yield]]s.<ref name=\"landguide\" />\n\n==Different types ==\n[[File:A potato field with soil erosion.jpg|thumb|Potato field with soil erosion]]\nIn addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries (water, wind and mechanical [[erosion]], physical, chemical and [[biological degradation]]), four other types have emerged in the last 50 years:<ref>Brabant Pierre, 2010.

All are induced or aggravated by human activities, e.g. [[Soil erosion]], [[Soil contamination]], [[Soil acidification]], \n[[sheet erosion]], [[silting]], [[aridification]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[urbanization]], etc.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Cattle.jpg|thumb|Overgrazing by [[livestock]] can lead to land degradation]]\nLand degradation is a global problem largely related to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use, [[Deforestation|deforestation]] and [[Global warming|Climate Change]]. Causes include:\n\n* Land clearance, such as [[clearcutting]] and [[Deforestation and climate change|deforestation]]\n* Agricultural depletion of soil [[nutrient]]s through poor farming practices\n* [[Livestock]] including [[overgrazing]] and [[overdrafting]]\n* Inappropriate [[irrigation]]<ref>{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18\u201334 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}</ref> and [[overdrafting]]\n* [[Urban sprawl]] and commercial development\n* Vehicle [[off-roading]]\n*[[Quarry]]ing of stone, sand, ore and minerals\n* Increase in field size due to [[economies of scale]], reducing shelter for wildlife, as [[hedgerow]]s and [[copse]]s disappear\n* Exposure of naked soil after harvesting by heavy equipment\n* [[Monoculture]], destabilizing the local ecosystem\n* Dumping of non-[[biodegradable]] trash, such as [[plastics]]\n* Invasive Species\n* [[Global warming|Climate Change]]\n* Loss of [[soil carbon]]\n\n[[File:Erosion.jpg|thumb|160px|Soil erosion in a [[wheat]] field near [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], US]]\n[[Overcutting]] of vegetation occurs when people cut forests, woodlands and shrublands\u2014to obtain [[timber]], [[fuelwood]] and other products\u2014at a pace [[ecological debt|exceeding the rate of natural regrowth]]. This is frequent in semi-arid environments, where [[fuelwood]] shortages are often severe. \n \n[[Overgrazing]] is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock [[carrying capacity]]; the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion. It is a significant factor in Afghanistan. The growing population pressure, during 1980\u20131990, has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries (14% for India and 21% for Pakistan).\n\n[[Population pressure]] also operates through other mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils.\n\nHigh population density is not always related to land degradation. Rather, it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded. Populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state. Land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many African and Asian countries.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011</ref>\n\nSevere land degradation affects a significant portion of the Earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and [[economic development]] of nations. As the land resource base becomes less productive, [[food security]] is compromised and competition for dwindling [[resource]]s increases, the seeds of [[famine]] and potential conflict are sown.\n\n===Climate change and land degradation===\nAccording to the [[Special Report on Climate Change and Land]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] climate change in one of the causes of land degradation. The report state that: \"Climate change exacerbates land degradation, particularly in lowlying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Over the period 1961\u20132013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability. In 2015, about 500 (380\u2013620) million people lived within areas which experienced [[desertification]] between the 1980s and 2000s. The highest numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced desertification. People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change (high confidence).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for Policymakers.

The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management. Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Earth sciences|Environment}}\n{{columns |width=40em |gap=2em\n|col1 =\n*[[Environmental impact of irrigation]]\n*[[Land improvement]]\n*[[Land reclamation]]\n*[[Sustainable agriculture]]\n|col2 = \n*[[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative]]\n*[[Desertification]]\n*[[Population growth]]\n*[[Soil#Degradation]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web | title = Human Induced Land Degradation is Preventable | url = http://soils.usda.gov/use/worldsoils/landdeg/degradation.html | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] \u2013 [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] | accessdate = 2006-06-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922201119/http://soils.usda.gov/use/worldsoils/landdeg/degradation.html | archivedate = 2006-09-22 }} ''This article incorporates text in the public domain produced by the [http://soils.usda.gov/ USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service]\n* {{cite conference | first = H. | last = Eswaran | author2 = R.

This can be seen through a loss of [[biomass]], a loss of actual productivity or in potential productivity, or a loss or change in [[vegetative cover]] and [[soil nutrient]]s.\n#Action in the land's capacity to provide resources for human livelihoods. This can be measured from a base line of past land use.\n#Loss of [[biodiversity]]: A loss of range of species or ecosystem complexity as a decline in the environmental quality.\n#Shifting ecological risk: increased vulnerability of the environment or people to destruction or crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction.\n\nA problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting [[crop]]s at a location with heavy [[rainfall]] and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of [[Soil erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]], yet  farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high [[crop yield]]s.<ref name=\"landguide\" />\n\n==Different types ==\n[[File:A potato field with soil erosion.jpg|thumb|Potato field with soil erosion]]\nIn addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries (water, wind and mechanical [[erosion]], physical, chemical and [[biological degradation]]), four other types have emerged in the last 50 years:<ref>Brabant Pierre, 2010.

All are induced or aggravated by human activities, e.g. [[Soil erosion]], [[Soil contamination]], [[Soil acidification]], \n[[sheet erosion]], [[silting]], [[aridification]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[urbanization]], etc.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Cattle.jpg|thumb|Overgrazing by [[livestock]] can lead to land degradation]]\nLand degradation is a global problem largely related to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use, [[Deforestation|deforestation]] and [[Global warming|Climate Change]]. Causes include:\n\n* Land clearance, such as [[clearcutting]] and [[deforestation]]\n* Agricultural depletion of soil [[nutrient]]s through poor farming practices\n* [[Livestock]] including [[overgrazing]] and [[overdrafting]]\n* Inappropriate [[irrigation]]<ref>{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18\u201334 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}</ref> and [[overdrafting]]\n* [[Urban sprawl]] and commercial development\n* Vehicle [[off-roading]]\n*[[Quarry]]ing of stone, sand, ore and minerals\n* Increase in field size due to [[economies of scale]], reducing shelter for wildlife, as [[hedgerow]]s and [[copse]]s disappear\n* Exposure of naked soil after harvesting by heavy equipment\n* [[Monoculture]], destabilizing the local ecosystem\n* Dumping of non-[[biodegradable]] trash, such as [[plastics]]\n* Invasive Species\n* [[Global warming|Climate Change]]\n* Loss of [[soil carbon]]\n\n[[File:Erosion.jpg|thumb|160px|Soil erosion in a [[wheat]] field near [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], US]]\n[[Overcutting]] of vegetation occurs when people cut forests, woodlands and shrublands\u2014to obtain [[timber]], [[fuelwood]] and other products\u2014at a pace [[ecological debt|exceeding the rate of natural regrowth]]. This is frequent in semi-arid environments, where [[fuelwood]] shortages are often severe. \n \n[[Overgrazing]] is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock [[carrying capacity]]; the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion. It is a significant factor in Afghanistan. The growing population pressure, during 1980\u20131990, has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries (14% for India and 21% for Pakistan).\n\n[[Population pressure]] also operates through other mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils.\n\nHigh population density is not always related to land degradation. Rather, it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded. Populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state. Land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many African and Asian countries.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011</ref>\n\nSevere land degradation affects a significant portion of the Earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and [[economic development]] of nations. As the land resource base becomes less productive, [[food security]] is compromised and competition for dwindling [[resource]]s increases, the seeds of [[famine]] and potential conflict are sown.\n\n===Climate change and land degradation===\nAccording to the [[Special Report on Climate Change and Land]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] climate change in one of the causes of land degradation. The report state that: \"Climate change exacerbates land degradation, particularly in lowlying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Over the period 1961\u20132013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability. In 2015, about 500 (380\u2013620) million people lived within areas which experienced [[desertification]] between the 1980s and 2000s. The highest numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced desertification. People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change (high confidence).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for Policymakers.

The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management. Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Earth sciences|Environment}}\n{{columns |width=40em |gap=2em\n|col1 =\n*[[Environmental impact of irrigation]]\n*[[Land improvement]]\n*[[Land reclamation]]\n*[[Sustainable agriculture]]\n|col2 = \n*[[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative]]\n*[[Desertification]]\n*[[Population growth]]\n*[[Soil#Degradation]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web | title = Human Induced Land Degradation is Preventable | url = http://soils.usda.gov/use/worldsoils/landdeg/degradation.html | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] \u2013 [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] | accessdate = 2006-06-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922201119/http://soils.usda.gov/use/worldsoils/landdeg/degradation.html | archivedate = 2006-09-22 }} ''This article incorporates text in the public domain produced by the [http://soils.usda.gov/ USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service]\n* {{cite conference | first = H. | last = Eswaran | author2 = R.

According to military prosecutors, Morant retaliated for the death in combat of his commanding officer with a series of [[revenge killing]]s against both Boer POWs and many civilian residents of the [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\nHe was accused of the [[summary execution]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], and the slaying of four [[Afrikaner]]s and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers who had been taken prisoner at the Elim Hospital. Morant was found guilty and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].\n\nLieutenants Morant and [[Peter Handcock]] were then court-martialed for the murder of the Rev. [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]], a South African-born Minister of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]]. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims at Elim Hospital, indignantly vowed to inform Morant's commanding officer, and had been shot to death the same afternoon. Morant and Handcock were acquitted of the Heese murder, but their sentences for murdering Floris Visser and the eight victims at Elim Hospital were implemented by a [[firing squad]] from the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] on 27 February 1902.\n\nMorant and Handcock have become [[folk hero]]es in modern Australia, representing a turning point for Australians\u2019 self-determination and independence from British rule. Their court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a [[Breaker Morant (play)|stage play]] and an award-winning [[Australian New Wave]] [[Breaker Morant (film)|movie]] by director [[Bruce Beresford]].\n\nUpon its release during 1980, Beresford's movie both brought Morant's life story to a worldwide audience and \"hoisted the images of the accused officers to the level of Australian icons and martyrs.\"<ref>Charles Leach (2012), ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried.

Attempts continue, with wide public support, to obtain a posthumous pardon or even a new trial.\n\nAccording to South African historian Charles Leach, \"In the opinion of many [[South African people|South Africans]], particularly descendants of victims as well as other involved persons in the far Northern Transvaal, justice was only partially achieved by the trial and the resultant sentences.

He was often described as \"well-educated\". He claimed to have been born in 1865 at [[Bideford, Devon]], England<ref name=\"H&H\">Hoofs and Horns, January 1986, ''Breaker Morant, Harry Reddel, Charlie Stewart and others'', p. 65</ref> and to be the son of Admiral Sir [[George Digby Morant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], a claim repeated as fact by later writers, although the Admiral denied it.<ref>Renar, Frank.

''Waroonga'']] at [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].\n\nAlthough Morant has often been described as an Australian, his former defence counsel, [[James Francis Thomas|Major J. F. Thomas]] later \"reacted strongly\" whenever his former client was described as such. In a letter to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' on 16 June 1923, Major Thomas wrote, \"Morant was not an Australian, he was an Englishman, who came to this country for 'colonial experience'.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 196.</ref> At the time, and until the [[Australian nationality law]] of 1948, all 'Australians' were in fact, [[British subject]]s.\n\nAfter his arrival, Murrant adopted the name Harry Harbord Morant and first settled in outback [[Queensland]]. During the next 15 years, he relocated to various places in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. He gained a reputation as a liquor-drinking, womanising \"bush\" poet and an expert horseman. He was one of the few who managed to ride the notorious buckjumper horse ''Dargin's Grey'' in a race that became a roughriding legend.<ref name=\"H&H\"/>\n\nMorant worked in a variety of occupations; he reportedly traded horses in [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]], then worked for a time for a newspaper at [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] during 1884, but there are suggestions{{Who|date=August 2009}} that he left both towns as a result of debts.

According to a 13 January 1900 report of his enlistment by ''[[The Adelaide Advertiser]]'', Morant, like all other volunteers, read and signed the following declaration:\n\n:We the undersigned, do hereby solemnly, sincerely and truly swear that we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]], her heirs and successors according to law, and that we will faithfully severally serve as members of the South Australian Volunteer Contingent enrolled for service in [[South Africa]], and we hereby severally bind ourselves from the 17th day of October 1899, until discharged to be subject to the provisions of the Army Act in force for the time being in [[British Army|Her Majesty's Army]], in like manner as if we had been severally and duly enlisted and attested for Her Majesty's Army for general service, and as if the said South Australian Volunteer Contingent formed part of Her Majesty's Army, and that we are in like manner during the same time severally to be subject to the Queen's rules and regulations, [[Articles of War#British Army|the rules and articles of war]], and to all such other rules and regulations and discipline of whatever nature or kind to which Her Majesty's Army is for the time being subject, and to all laws, rules and regulations in force within the Province of South Africa under the ''Defence Act 1895''; and also to all rules and regulations re: general orders and for any general officer commanding Her Majesty's forces in South Africa in which we may severally for the time be serving.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 203\">Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\nMorant was reportedly invited to visit the summer residence of [[South Australia]]'s governor, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]. After completing his training, he was appointed [[Lance Corporal|lance corporal]] and his [[regiment]] embarked for the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] on 26 January 1900.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29528172 |title=The Mounted Contingent |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 January 1900 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\nIn many respects, the terrain and climate of [[South Africa]] are similar to that of outback Australia, so Morant was in his element.  His superb horsemanship, expert bush skills and educated manner soon attracted the attention of his superiors. South Australian Colonel [[Joseph Maria Gordon|Joseph Gordon]] recommended him as a dispatch rider to [[Bennet Burleigh]], the [[war correspondent]] of the London ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''; the job reportedly provided Morant with ample opportunity to visit the nearby hospital and pursue dalliances with the nurses.\n\nA letter written on 23 January 1901 was sent to Admiral Sir George Morant by the [[Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel|Mount Nelson Hotel]] in [[Cape Town]] alleging that Sergeant Morant had stayed there during November 1900, while claiming to be the Admiral's son. \"The Breaker\" had further claimed to be a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and had \"left without discharging his liability\" of \u00a316/13s. The letter concluded, \"We shall esteem it a favour if you will let us know the course we had better adopt. We are adverse to taking the matter to court till we had heard from you.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 158.</ref>\n\nAccording to his co-defendant, Lieutenant [[George Witton]], Morant served with the South Australian Second Contingent for nine months, during which time he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nDuring March 1900, Sergeant Morant carried dispatches for the Flying Column to [[Prieska]], commanded by Colonel Lowe, 7th D.G., who was in the general advance to [[Bloemfontein]] and participated with the engagements of Karee Siding and Kroonstadt, and other engagements with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] until the entry into [[Pretoria]].  Morant was at the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]] and was then part of [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|General French]]'s staff, Cavalry Brigade, as war correspondent with [[Bennet Burleigh]] of the London ''Daily Telegraph''.  He accompanied that unit through [[Middelburg, Eastern Cape|Middelburg]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]] to the occupation of [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]].  At this point, he took leave and returned to England for six months. There, he befriended Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, and the two of them became engaged to a pair of sisters.\n\nCaptain Hunt, who was still \"signed on\", returned to South Africa to command the B [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of the Bushveldt [[Carbineer]]s, whereas Morant (who had intended that his military service end) followed him soon afterward not having found the forgiveness he sought in England.<ref>Citation needed !  WHAT \"forgiveness\" was that ?</ref> Originally, he returned to South Africa to accept a commission with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell's]] Transvaal Constabulary; he was convinced by Hunt to accept instead a commission with the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC).\n\nLieutenant Morant enlisted as a commissioned officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) on 1 April 1901.\n\n==The Bushveldt Carbineers==\nAfter their defeats in open battle during 1899\u20131900, the [[Boer Commando]]s began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Military campaign|campaign]] against both British and Commonwealth forces.  In response, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the British commander in South Africa, assembled and deployed a number of [[irregular military|irregular]] regiments to combat Boer [[commando]] units and protect British interests in the region. On his return from leave, Morant joined one of these irregular units, the Bushveldt Carbineers (or BVC), a 320-man regiment that had been formed and commanded during February 1901 by an Australian, Colonel Robert Lenehan.  After his friend's example, Captain Hunt joined the BVC soon after.\n\nThe regiment, based in [[Pietersburg]], {{convert|180|mi|km}} north of Pretoria, saw combat in the [[Spelonken]] region of the [[Northern Transvaal]] during 1901\u20131902.\n\nBy the summer of 1901, rumours had reached the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg \"of poor discipline, unconfirmed murders, drunkenness, and general lawlessness in the Spelonken.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 26.</ref> It was further alleged that a local woman had accused a British Army officer of [[sexual assault]]. Further investigation revealed that the alleged rapist was Captain James Robertson, the commanding officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers' A Squadron, based at Sweetwaters Farm. In response, Captain Robertson was recalled to HQ and given a choice between [[court martial]] and resigning his commission. Robertson submitted his resignation and quit the British Armed Forces.<ref>Leach (2012), page 23.</ref>\n\nIn response, Captain [[Percy Frederic Hunt]], \"an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\" was ordered to the Northern Transvaal and given command of the Bushveldt Carbineers \"B Squadron\". Before departing Pietersburg on the night of 11 July 1901, Captain Hunt successfully \"requested the transfer of certain officers and friends of his\" to his new field of command. These men included Lieutenants Morant, Charles Hannam, and Harry Picton.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Fort Edward==\nThe exact sequence and nature of the events resulting in Morant's arrest and trial are still disputed, and accounts vary considerably. While it seems certain that some members of the BVC were responsible for shooting Boer POWs and civilian noncombatants, the precise circumstances of these killings and the identities of those responsible will probably never be known for certain.  The following account is drawn mainly from the only surviving eyewitness source, and the 1907 book ''[[Scapegoats of the Empire]]'' by Lieutenant [[George Witton]],<ref>[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ViewPDF.aspx?B=8157064&D=D '''NAA: A1336, 227''': Copyright Application by George Ramsdale Whitton for ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', dated 7 August 1907, ''National Archives of Australia'', (contains photographs of each of the book's 240 pages).]</ref> one of the three Australians sentenced to death for the alleged murders and the only one to escape execution.\n\nWith Hunt now commanding the detachment at Fort Edward, discipline was immediately reimposed by Lieutenant Morant and Lieutenant Handcock, but this was resisted by some. In one incident, several members of a supply convoy commanded by Lieutenant Picton looted the rum it was carrying, resulting in their arrest for [[insubordination]] and for threatening to shoot Picton. They escaped to Pietersburg, but Captain Hunt sent a report to Colonel Lenehan, who had them detained. When the matter was brought before Colonel Hall, the commandant of Pietersburg, he ordered the offenders to be discharged from the regiment and released. In his book, Witton explicitly accused these disaffected troopers of being responsible for \"the monstrous and extravagant reports about the BVC which appeared later in the English and colonial press.\"\n\nBack at Fort Edward, the seized livestock<ref>What livestock ?</ref> were collected and given to the proper authorities and the stills<ref>What stills ?</ref> were destroyed, but according to Witton, these actions were resented by the perpetrators, and as a result Morant and Handcock were \"detested\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} by certain members of the detachment.<ref>This is a bob sequitor - it needs amplification</ref>\n\nWitton arrived at Fort Edward on 3 August with Sergeant Major Hammett and 30 men, and it was at this point that he met Morant and Handcock for the first time.\n\n==The Battle at Duivelskloof==\n===Prelude===\nAt the end of July 1901, the garrison at Fort Edward received a visit from the Reverend Fritz Reuter of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] and his family. Rev. Reuter was assigned to the Medingen Mission Station and, despite later claims by his family, he \"seems to have been an exception\" to the generally Republican sympathies \"of the Zoutpansberg German population\". In conversation with Captain Hunt, Rev. Reuter reported that Veldcornet Barend Viljoen's Commando was present at [[Duivelskloof]] and had been \"harassing local noncombatant farmers\". Rev. Reuter further alleged that his own mission station had been threatened. In response, Captain Hunt ordered a detachment under BVC Sergeant A.B.C. Cecil to protect the missionary and his family on their return journey.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nAfter Rev. Reuter's intelligence had been confirmed by a Native runner, Captain Hunt also learned that Sergeant Cecil's patrol had been ambushed near the Medingen Mission Station. In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. In addition to service personnel of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]], the patrol included Tony Schiel, a defector from the Zoutpansberg Commando and Intelligence Scout for Captain Taylor.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 38-39.</ref>\n\nIt was to be Schiel's task to command between 300 and 400 [[irregular military|irregulars]] drawn from the local [[Lobedu people]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received \"warnings and expressions of caution\" regarding \"the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night\" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Deciding to proceed anyway, Captain Hunt commanded \"his patrol into a situation that would echo through the next 100 years.\"<ref>Leach (2012), pages 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Ambush===\nAccording to the diary of BVC Trooper J.S. Silke, Rev. Reuter warned Hunt against attacking. The Viljoen farm, he explained, was built on a rocky hillside and \"was unassailable\". Furthermore, the nearby Botha farm contained more than 40 armed men who could easily intercept Hunt's line of retreat. Despite the warning and the fact that it was a bright moonlit night, Hunt chose to attack anyway.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-43.</ref>\n\nAfter planning a two-pronged attack, Captain Hunt ordered Trooper Silke to wait for a signal shot and rush the farmhouse from behind with 50 Lobedu warriors. Then, Captain Hunt approached the farmhouse via concrete steps terraced into the hillside.\n\nMeanwhile, the Viljoen Commando knew, according to Burgher Hendrik Adriaan Jacobs, that an attack was coming. Many commandos, however, were \"feverish\" from the effects of [[malaria]] and fatalistically waited for the arrival of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Jacobs later recalled how he saw Hunt's party through a window and began shooting. Possibly mistaking Jacobs's first shot for the signal, the BVC and the Lobedu also began shooting and general pandemonium ensued. In an exchange of fire, Captain Hunt was shot through the chest.  Sergeant Eland was killed attempting to go to Hunt's aid, as was at least one Lobedu warrior. On the Boer side, Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and G. Hartzenberg were killed. The dead of both sides were left behind by their retreating comrades.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-45.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWhen the surviving members of the patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter asked them about their officers and \"was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened\". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, \"My father roused on them, asking how they could leave their Captain like that.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 43.</ref>\n\nAccording to Leach, Captain Hunt's broken neck would be consistent with a fall down the concrete steps after being wounded. The mutilations found on his body were also found on the bodies of the three dead Boers. Both sides blamed the other for the disfigurement of the dead. Hendrik Jacobs, however, believed that Lobedu witch-doctors were to blame. According to historian Charles Leach, the mutilations do conform with accounts, by French anthropologist [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Junod]], of the traditional warfare practices of the Lobedu people.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 44-51.</ref>\n\nThe body of Captain Percy Hunt was buried at the Medingen Mission Station, where a cross was later installed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].  Sergeant Eland was buried at his family's homestead, the Ravenshill Farm, after a burial service was read by Rev. Reuter.\n\n==Revenge killings==\nWhen news of Hunt's death reached the fort, it had a profound effect on Morant; Witton said he became \"like a man demented\".<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400611.txt George Witton, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', Chapter IX \u2013 \"Death of Captain Hunt.--Morant's Reprisals\" (Project Gutenberg e-text edition)]</ref> Morant immediately ordered every available man out on patrol, became emotional while addressing the men, and ordered them to avenge the death of their captain and \"[[No quarter|give no quarter]]\".\n\nSignificantly, Morant did not see Hunt's body himself; according to Witton, Morant arrived about an hour after the burial. He questioned the men about Hunt's death and, convinced that his friend had been murdered in cold blood, he again vowed to give no quarter and take no prisoners.  Witton recounted that Morant then declared that he had, on occasion, ignored Hunt's order to this effect in the past, but that he would carry it out in the future.\n\n===Retaliation===\nThe next day, after leaving a few men to guard the mission (which the Boers threatened to burn in reprisal for harbouring the British), Morant commanded his unit back to the Viljoen farm.  It had been abandoned, so they tracked the retreating Boers all day, sighting them just at dusk. As the Australians closed in, the emotional Morant began shooting too early and they lost the element of surprise, so most of the Boers escaped. They did, however, capture one commando named Visser, wounded in the ankles so that he could not walk.\n\nThe next morning, as Morant and his men continued their pursuit, a native runner brought a message that the lightly-manned Fort Edward was in danger of being attacked by the Boers, so Morant decided to abandon the chase.\n\nAt this time, he searched and questioned Visser and found items of British uniform, including a pair of trousers which he believed was Hunt's, but which was later proved to be of much older origin. Morant then told Witton and others that he would have Visser shot at the first opportunity. When they stopped to eat around 11&nbsp;a.m., Morant again told Witton that he intended to have Visser shot, quoting orders \"direct from headquarters\" and citing Kitchener's recent alleged \"no prisoners\" proclamation. He called for a firing party, and although some of the men initially objected, Visser was made to sit down on an embankment (he could not stand), and was shot. After being shot, Visser was still alive, and Morant ordered Picton to administer a [[coup-de-grace]] with pistol shots to the head.\n\nOn the return journey to the fort, Morant's unit stopped for the night at the store of a British trader, a Mr Hays, who was well known for his hospitality.  After they left, Hays was raided by a party of Boers who looted everything he owned.  When Morant and his men arrived back at Fort Edward, they learned that a convoy under Lieutenant Neel had arrived from Pietersburg the previous day, just in time to reinforce Captain Taylor against a strong Boer force that attacked the fort. During the encounter, one Carbineer was wounded and several horses were shot. It was at this time that Taylor had a native shot, for refusing to give him information about the Boers' movements. Neel and Picton then returned to Pietersburg. <!-- what happened here?! -->\n\nOther killings followed. On 23 August, Morant commanded a small patrol to intercept a group of eight prisoners from Viljoen's commandos who were being brought in as prisoners; Morant ordered them to be taken to the side of the road and summarily shot. The South African born German missionary Reverend Predikant C.H.D. Heese spoke to the prisoners prior to the shooting.\n\nAbout a week later, reports began to circulate that Reverend Heese had been found shot along the Pietersburg road about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the fort on his way to Pietersburg to report the activities of Morant and his group to the British authorities. Soon afterwards, acting on a report that three armed Boer commandos were travelling to the fort, Morant took Handcock and several other men to intercept them. After the Boers surrendered with a white flag, they were taken prisoner, disarmed and shot.\n\nLater the same day, Major Lenehan arrived at Fort Edward for a rare visit. Morant persuaded Lenehan to let him command a strong patrol out to search for a small Boer unit commanded by [[Field Cornet|Field-cornet]] Kelly, an Irish-Boer commando whose farm was in the district. Kelly had fought against the British in the main actions of the war, and after returning to his home he had become a commando rather than surrender.\n\nMorant's patrol left Fort Edward on 16 September 1901 with orders from Lenehan that Kelly and his men were to be captured and brought back alive if possible. Covering {{convert|130|mi|km}} in a week of hard riding, they left their horses {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Kelly's [[laager]] and went the rest of the way on foot.  During the early hours of the next morning, Morant's patrol charged the laager, this time taking the Boers completely by surprise; Morant himself arrested Kelly at gunpoint at the door of his tent.  A week later, they returned to Fort Edward with the Kelly party and then escorted them safely to Pietersburg. The British commandant, Colonel Hall, sent Morant a message congratulating him on the success of his mission, after which Morant took two weeks' leave.\n\n==The letter==\nOn 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was dispatched secretly to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army [[Officer Commanding]] at [[Pietersburg]].

The shooting of six surrendered [[Afrikaner people|Afrikaner]] men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at [[Valdezia]] on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred Taylor]] and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been done by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 17-22, 99.</ref>\n\n:2. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. [[Peter Handcock]] on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had \"disapproved\" of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims' wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 22-23, 99.</ref>\n\n:3. The [[revenge killing]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt Morant had ordered his men to form a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] was delivered by BVC Lt Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at [[Duivelskloof]] on 6 August 1901.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 35-60, 100.</ref>\n\n:4. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. [[George Witton]], Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane's letter made no mention of the fact, three Native South African witnesses were also shot dead.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 61-72, 100.</ref>\n\n:The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]] of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese's driver, a member of the [[Southern Ndebele people]], was also killed.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 62-68, 73-82, 100.</ref>\n\n:5. The orders, given by BVC Lt Charles H.G. Hannam, to shoot at a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire caused the deaths of two boys, aged five and 13 years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 83-86, 100.</ref>\n\n:6. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 87-90, 100-101.</ref>\n\nThe letter then accused the [[Field Commander]] of the BVC, Major Robert Lenahan, of being \"privy to these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\" After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 100-101.</ref>\n\n==Arrest==\nIn response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Colonel Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and noncommissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97-98.</ref>\n\n==Indictments==\nAlthough the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, were later destroyed by the [[British civil service]],<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\">Leach (2012), page 104, 106.</ref> it is known that a Court of Inquiry, the British military's equivalent to a [[grand jury]], was convened on 16 October 1901. The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the [[Provost Marshal]] of Pietersburg. The first session of the Court occurred on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for further two weeks,<ref>Leach (2012), page 105.</ref> at which time it became known that the indictments would be as follows:\n\n:1.

St. Claire wrote, \"I agree generally with the  views expressed by the Court of Inquiry in the opinions of the several cases. The idea that no prisoners were to be taken in the Spelonken area appears to have been started by the late Captain Hunt & after his death continued by orders given personally by Captain Taylor.\n\n\"The statement that Captain Hunt's body had been maltreated is in no way corroborated & the reprisals undertaken by Lt Morant on this idea were utterly unjustifiable.\n\n\"Lieut Morant seems to have been the primary mover in carrying out these orders, & Lieut Handcock willingly lent himself out as the principle executioner of them.\n\n\"Lieut Morant acquiesced in the illegal execution of the wounded Boer Visser & took a personal part in the massacre of the 8 surrendered Boers on 23 August.\n\n\"The two N.C.O.s acted under orders but were not justified in obeying illegal commands. After the murder of Van Buuren the officers seem to have exercised a reign of terror in the District, which hindered their men from reporting their illegal acts & even prevented their objecting to assist in the crime.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 125\"/>\n\n==Court-martial==\n{{main|Court martial of Breaker Morant}}\n\nThe court-martial of Morant and his co-accused began on 16 January 1902 and was conducted in several stages. Two main hearings were conducted at Pietersburg in relatively relaxed conditions; one concerned the shooting of Visser, the other the \"Eight Boers\" case. A large number of depositions by members of the BVC were made, giving damning evidence against the accused. For example, a Trooper Thompson stated that, on the morning of the 23rd (1901), he saw a party of soldiers with eight Boers: \"Morant gave orders, and the prisoners were taken off the road and shot, Handcock killing two with his revolver. Morant later told me that we had to play into his hands, or else they would know what to expect.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} A Corporal Sharp said that he \"would walk 100 miles barefoot to serve in a firing squad to shoot Morant and Handcock.\"\n\nSoon after the second hearing, the prisoners were put in irons, taken to [[Pretoria]] while heavily guarded, and tried on the third main count, that of killing Reverend Heese. Although acquitted of killing Reverend Heese, Morant and his co-accused were quickly sentenced to death on the other two charges. Morant and Handcock were shot within days of sentencing, while Witton's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Lord Kitchener. Kitchener personally signed Morant and Handcock's [[execution warrant|death warrant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Field Marshal was absent on tour when the executions occurred.\n\n==Execution==\nDuring the day of 26 February, Morant and Handcock were visited by a distraught Major Thomas; Witton says that news of the impending execution had \"almost driven him crazy\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} Thomas then rushed away to find Kitchener and plead with him, but was informed by Colonel Kelly that the Commander-in-Chief was away and was not expected back for several days. Thomas pleaded with Kelly to have the executions stayed for a few days until he could appeal to the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King]], but was told that the sentences had already been referred to England \u2014 and confirmed \u2014 and that there was \"not the slightest hope\" of a reprieve; Morant and Handcock \"must pay for what he did\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to see a clergyman, Morant replied indignantly, \"No! I'm a [[Paganism|Pagan]]!\"<ref>Witton, Ch. XX \u2013 \"Execution of Morant and Handcock\"</ref>  On hearing this, Handcock asked, \"What's a Pagan?\" and after hearing the explanation, declared \"I'm a Pagan too!\" As the afternoon wore on, all the prisoners could clearly hear the sound of coffins being built in the nearby workshop. At 16:00 hours, Witton was told he would be leaving for England at five o'clock the next morning.\n\nThat night, Morant, Picton, Handcock and Witton had a last supper together; at Morant's request, he and Handcock were allowed to spend their last night in the same cell. Morant spent most of the night writing and then penned a final sardonic verse, and a confession which read\n\n:To the Rev.

The Australian government and Lieutenant Handcock's wife, who lived in Bathurst with their three children, learned of Handcock and Morant's deaths from the Australian newspapers weeks after their executions. After learning of his sentence, Lieutenant Witton arranged to send two telegrams, one to the Australian government representative in [[Pretoria]] and the other to a relative in Victoria, but despite assurances from the British, neither telegram was ever received.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Federation_of_Australia|newly federated Australian government]] demanded an explanation from Kitchener who, on 5 April 1902, sent a telegram to the Australian Governor-General, which was published in its entirety in the Australian press. It reads as follows:<ref name=argussenthome>{{Cite news | newspaper = The Argus | date = 7 April 1902 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9634927 | page = 5 | title = THE COURT-MARTIALLED AUSTRALIANS|via=nla.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n:In reply to your telegram, Morant, Handcock and Witton were charged with twenty separate murders, including one of a German missionary who had witnessed other murders. Twelve of these murders were proved. From the evidence it appears that Morant was the originator of these crimes which Handcock carried out in cold-blooded manner. The murders were committed in the wildest parts of the Transvaal, known as Spelonken, about eighty miles north of Pretoria, on four separate dates namely July 2, August 11, August 23, and September 7. In one case, where eight Boer prisoners were murdered, it was alleged to have been done in a spirit of revenge for the ill treatment of one of their officers \u2013 Captain Hunt \u2013 who was killed in action. No such ill-treatment was proved. The prisoners were convicted after a most exhaustive trial, and were defended by counsel. There were, in my opinion, no extenuating circumstances. Lieutenant Witton was also convicted but I commuted the sentence to penal servitude for life, in consideration of his having been under the influence of Morant and Handcock. The proceedings have been sent home.\n\nNews of the executions excited considerable public interest in the UK and a summary of the trial was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 18 April 1902, but the British government announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that, in keeping with normal practice, the court-martial proceedings would not be made public. During 1981, South African historian Dr. C.A.R. Schulenburg wrote to the [[Public Record Office]] and was informed by letter that the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, had \"been destroyed under statute\" by the [[British civil service]] between 1923 and 1958.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\"/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.\n\nGeorge Witton was transported to naval detention quarters in England and then to [[Lewes]] prison in [[Sussex]]. Some time later, he was transferred to the prison at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Dorset]], and was released after serving twenty-eight months. His release was notified to the British House of Commons on 10 August 1904.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/aug/10/ex-lieutenant-wittons-release#S4V0140P0_19040810_HOC_63 Hansard], HC 4ser vol 140 col 19.</ref> On his release he returned to Australia and for a while lived in [[Lancefield, Victoria]], where he wrote his controversial book about the Morant case.

There are facts intermingled with fiction.\n\nThe most important primary source, the official record of the court-martial, vanished after the trial, and its location remains a mystery. A report on the case from Kitchener to the Australian Governor-General (published in the Australian press on 7 April 1902) quotes Kitchener as saying that \"the proceedings have been sent home\" [i.e. to England].<ref name=argussenthome /> Whatever their actual fate, the transcripts have not been seen since the trial and evidently not even the Australian government was granted access to them.\n\nIn the 'Afterword' to the 1982 reprint of Witton's book, G.A. Embleton states that{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\n:...the British authorities have been approached by many researchers eager to examine the transcripts thought to be held by the War Office. Invariably these requests have been met with denials that the documents exist or pronouncements to the effect that they cannot be released until the year 2002 ... It now appears that the papers never reached England ... (it was) recently announced that the court-martial papers had been discovered in South Africa...\n\nA comprehensive record of the trial of Morant and Handcock, complete with a large number of depositions by members of the BVC and other witnesses of the deeds of Morant and Handcock, appears in Arthur Davey's publication \"Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers\" ([[Van Riebeeck Society]], Cape Town 1987).\n\nDuring 2012, South African historian Charles Leach published the book ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is DEAD and BURIED: A South African version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 \u2013 April 1902''. Based upon extensive research, Leach had complete access to unpublished South African sources and the papers of the Viljoen and Heese families.\n\nJoe West, a British Bushveldt Carbineers researcher, wrote in response: \"Charles Leach's impressive research has revealed that the crimes of Morant and his associates were worse than originally thought. In today's day and age Morant and Handcock plus several others would be arraigned before a War Crime Tribunal.\"\n\n===Primary sources===\n\nIn the absence of the original trial records, three primary sources remain. The first is the report of the trial printed in ''The Times'' during April 1902; the second is George Witton's account of the events of 1901\u201302, contained in his book ''Scapegoats of the Empire''. The third is a letter about the case, written by Witton to Major Thomas during 1929, which was kept secret at Witton's request until 1970. In it, Witton suggests that although Handcock confessed to the crimes, he did so under duress.\n\nMore recently, a diary written by [[Robert Poore]], the Provost Marshall at the time, was unearthed with a record for 7 October 1901. It reads:\n\n{{Quote|text=The Bushveldt Carbineers accepted the surrender of 8 Boers and after taking them along for some time shot them. If they had intended doing this they should not have accepted a surrender in the first instance. A German missionary was close by and so as to prevent him saying anything they shot him too.

(Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) Cutlack's story, said Wilcox, was based on Witton's ''Scapegoats'' and Frank Fox's ''Breaker Morant''.\n\nThe 1976 book ''The Australians At The Boer War'' by Australian writer R.L. Wallace gives a concise and reasonably detailed account of Morant's military career, trial and execution although it contains almost no information about Morant's earlier life and omits a number of significant details contained in Witton's account of the events resulting in Morant's trial. However, Wallace was writing an overall account of the Australians' role in South Africa, not the life of Morant, Handcock or Witton.\n\nThe most widely known book is the best-selling Australian novel ''The Breaker'' by [[Kit Denton]], first published in 1973 and inspired by Denton's meeting and conversation with a Boer War veteran who had known Morant. Wilcox suggested this book is a follow-on from Cutlack's book and helped establish the myth. (Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) However, Denton claimed that Morant and Handcock were executed in Pietersburg and buried near that spot. This mistake appeared in his book as late as 1981 (7th edition, p.&nbsp;268), and is a possible reason as to why there is confusion about the location of the execution, i.e., Pretoria or Pietersburg.\n\n[[Kenneth G. Ross|Kenneth Ross]]'s 1978 successful and widely acclaimed play ''[[Breaker Morant (play)|Breaker Morant: A Play in Two Acts]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7267-0997-2}}), was adapted by Ross and [[Bruce Beresford]] into Beresford's 1980 movie ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. The movie was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay#1980s|1980 Academy Award for a screenplay adapted from another source]].\n\nDuring 1988 in the small town of Burra, South Australia, where Bruce Beresford's movie 'Breaker Morant' was filmed, David Jennings organized a 'Retrial of Morant, Handcock and Witton'. The townsfolk staged the retrial and generated the imagination of people from all over the world. Much archival material which had been gathering dust in attics was submitted. Although the three Justices of the Peace who presided over the 'Retrial' found all three not guilty on the balance of probabilities that Kitchener had issued the orders to execute Boers in khaki only a diary extract from a deceased Australian Staff Officer on Kitchener's staff indicated that he had verbally instructed Captain Hunt and the Bushveldt Carbineers to execute prisoners, especially those wearing khaki.\n\n===Legacy===\n\nAlthough it is generally accepted that Morant and/or others in his regiment were responsible for the deaths of a number of Boer commandos, historical opinion is still divided over the main questions of the case \u2014 how many Boers were killed, by whom were they killed, and on whose orders? In his book, ''Born to Fight'', Neil Speed has photos of a number of Canadian Scouts wearing black feathers (pp.&nbsp;105 & 119.), a symbol that they would shoot any armed Boer they captured.\n\nMorant's devotees, however, argue that he and Handcock were unfairly singled out for punishment even though many other British soldiers were known to have committed summary executions of Boer prisoners. In their opinion, the two Australians were made scapegoats by the British, who were intent on concealing the existence of the \"take no prisoners\" policy against Boer insurgents \u2014 a policy which, they claim, had been promulgated by Kitchener himself.\n\nHowever, Hamish Paterson, a South African military historian and a member of the Military History Society, has emphasised that the Bushveldt Carbineers were a British Imperial unit, not an Australian one: technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers.\n\nA 2002 book by Nick Bleszynski, ''Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant'', promoted the \"scapegoat\" argument.<ref>Bleszynski, Nick (2002), ''<nowiki>'Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant</nowiki>''. Random House Australia. {{ISBN|1-74051-081-X}}. (Novel)</ref> It said that while Morant and the others probably committed some crimes and may well have deserved disciplinary action, there is now persuasive evidence from several sources to show that the Kitchener 'no prisoners' order did indeed exist, that it was widely known among both the British and Australian troops and was performed by many disparate units. It also asserted that the court-martial's procedures were flawed.\n\nThe graves of Morant and Handcock were left unattended for many years, but after the release of Beresford's movie it became a popular place of pilgrimage for Australian tourists.  During June 1998, the Australian Government spent $1,500 refurbishing the gravesite with a new concrete slab. The marble cross which stood over the grave had been vandalised, as had many other gravestones nearby.\n\nA series of monuments now mark the locations of some of the incidents, including that of the night attack, and the site of the mass grave of eight burghers.<ref name=zoutnet>{{cite news|last1=van der Westhuizen |first1=Linda |title=Monument honours those who died |url=http://www.zoutnet.co.za/articles/news/11614/2012-01-27/monument-honours-those-who-died |accessdate=28 September 2015 |website=www.zoutnet.co.za|agency=Zoutnet |date=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Petition==\n{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}\n\nDuring 2002, a group of Australians travelled to South Africa and held a service at the Pretoria graveside to commemorate the execution on the morning of its hundredth anniversary.  The service was also attended by the Australian [[High Commissioner]] to South Africa.  The group left a new marker on the grave.\n\nA petition to pardon Morant and Handcock was sent to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during February 2010.  The petition has been severely criticised in South Africa, specifically by descendants of the Viljoen brothers who were killed in the skirmish with Hunt and Eland and by the descendants of the family of Rev. Heese.\n\nHamish Paterson states:  \"I don\u2019t think they [the Australian supporters of a Morant pardon] have actually considered what Morant was convicted of. Let's start off with the laws of war. If for example, we have a surrender. You want to surrender and I don\u2019t accept your surrender, so I choose not to accept it, that I\u2019m entitled to do. [...] However, the situation changes dramatically once I accept your surrender, then I must remove you from the battlefield to a POW camp and keep you safe. If, for example, Kitchener said, \"take no prisoners\", that was very different from \"shoot prisoners!\" So Morant and Handcock made two very basic errors: Once you\u2019ve accepted the surrender, you take them to the railway line and get them shipped off to Bermuda, or wherever. At that point, the sensible thing to do was to ship them off to a POW camp. The next error was to shoot these guys in front of a neutral witness, and then you kill the witness. These are a series of terrible errors of judgement. Because they killed a German missionary, the Kaiser (became) involved. [...] Technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers. The problem was you were dealing with an unstable set-up in the BVC . It had just been formed. I don\u2019t see a regular Australian unit behaving that way. I rather suspect why no British guys were shot was that they were either regular army or militia, or yeomanry, all of which are very unlikely to actually shoot prisoners. I think no British were shot because they hadn\u2019t made the mistake of shooting prisoners who\u2019d already surrendered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/287483|title=South African Historian Against Royal Pardon For \u2018Breaker\u2019 Morant|author=Szabo, Christopher|website=www.digitaljournal.com|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>\n\nJim Unkles, an Australian lawyer, submitted two petitions during October 2009, one to Queen Elizabeth II and the other to the House of Representatives Petitions Committee, to review the convictions and sentences of Morant, Handcock, and Witton.

Although its provenance is obscure (Thomas died on 11 November, 1942) it is believed that the bag had originally come from the former home of James Thomas, the Tenterfield solicitor who defended Morant and his colleagues at their court martial. The items found included a number of personal effects engraved with Morant's name and/or his initials, including a penny on a leather thong, engraved with his name, which has a roughly circular nick on the edge. Although it cannot be confirmed, it is speculated that Morant was wearing the penny (an early form of 'dog tag') at the moment he was shot and that the nick was caused by the passage of one of the bullets that killed him. Other Morant effects contained in the bag included fragments of a trumpet, a bayonet scabbard, a bandolier (believed to be the one Morant wore in his famous photo portrait), a cigarette case (thought to be the one Morant gave to Thomas just before he was shot), brass drinking cups engraved with the initials HM, army field mess equipment, and a Boer War medal. The cache also included an Australian red ensign which is thought to be the same flag that is seen draping Morant and Handcock's grave in the famous photograph of Thomas standing by the burial plot. The ensign had been signed by Thomas in ink on one of the white stars and has the following inscription:\n\n\"This flag bore witness [to] utter scapegoats of the Empire Feb 27 1902 Pretoria.\"\n\n\"Signed J F Thomas.\"\n\n\"Handcock Feb 17 1868 Feb 27 1902 RIP.\"\n\n\"Lt Henry H Morant Dec 9 1864 Feb 27 1902 Pretoria RIP.\"\n\nThe bag also contained newspaper clippings and books and papers pertaining to [[Sir Henry Parkes]] and the Australian Federation process. Unfortunately, a significant quantity of badly damaged documents found in the bag were discarded by the anonymous finder before he realised the significance of the trove. The anonymous finder \u2013 known only as \"Mr Collector\" \u2013 subsequently donated the items to Tenterfield's Henry Parkes School of Arts museum, where they are now on public display.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/breaker-morant-relics-found-on-rubbish-tip-20160422-gocn1a.html|title=Breaker Morant relics found on rubbish tip|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=22 April 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Horse Memorial]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=Davey| first=Arthur| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18997618| title=Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers| publication-date=1987| publisher=Van Riebeeck Society| isbn=978-0-620-12485-0}}\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=George| first=Dave C| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9581857| title=Carvings from the Veldt : a pictorial history of rifle stock art from the Anglo Boer War 1899-1902| publication-date=2004 | publisher=Dave C.

According to military prosecutors, Morant retaliated for the death in combat of his commanding officer with a series of [[revenge killing]]s against both Boer POWs and many civilian residents of the [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\nHe was accused of the [[summary execution]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], and the slaying of four [[Afrikaner]]s and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers who had been taken prisoner at the Elim Hospital. Morant was found guilty and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].\n\nLieutenants Morant and [[Peter Handcock]] were then court-martialed for the murder of the Rev. [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]], a South African-born Minister of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]]. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims at Elim Hospital, indignantly vowed to inform Morant's commanding officer, and had been shot to death the same afternoon. Morant and Handcock were acquitted of the Heese murder, but their sentences for murdering Floris Visser and the eight victims at Elim Hospital were implemented by a [[firing squad]] from the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] on 27 February 1902.\n\nMorant and Handcock have become [[folk hero]]es in modern Australia, representing a turning point for Australians\u2019 self-determination and independence from British rule. Their court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a [[Breaker Morant (play)|stage play]] and an award-winning [[Australian New Wave]] [[Breaker Morant (film)|movie]] by director [[Bruce Beresford]].\n\nUpon its release during 1980, Beresford's movie both brought Morant's life story to a worldwide audience and \"hoisted the images of the accused officers to the level of Australian icons and martyrs.\"<ref>Charles Leach (2012), ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried.

He was often described as \"well-educated\". He claimed to have been born in 1865 at [[Bideford, Devon]], England<ref name=\"H&H\">Hoofs and Horns, January 1986, ''Breaker Morant, Harry Reddel, Charlie Stewart and others'', p. 65</ref> and to be the son of Admiral Sir [[George Digby Morant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], a claim repeated as fact by later writers, although the Admiral denied it.<ref>Renar, Frank.

''Waroonga'']] at [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].\n\nAlthough Morant has often been described as an Australian, his former defence counsel, [[James Francis Thomas|Major J. F. Thomas]] later \"reacted strongly\" whenever his former client was described as such. In a letter to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' on 16 June 1923, Major Thomas wrote, \"Morant was not an Australian, he was an Englishman, who came to this country for 'colonial experience'.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 196.</ref> At the time, and until the [[Australian nationality law]] of 1948, all 'Australians' were in fact, [[British subject]]s.\n\nAfter his arrival, Murrant adopted the name Harry Harbord Morant and first settled in outback [[Queensland]]. During the next 15 years, he relocated to various places in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. He gained a reputation as a liquor-drinking, womanising \"bush\" poet and an expert horseman. He was one of the few who managed to ride the notorious buckjumper horse ''Dargin's Grey'' in a race that became a roughriding legend.<ref name=\"H&H\"/>\n\nMorant worked in a variety of occupations; he reportedly traded horses in [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]], then worked for a time for a newspaper at [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] during 1884, but there are suggestions{{Who|date=August 2009}} that he left both towns as a result of debts.

According to a 13 January 1900 report of his enlistment by ''[[The Adelaide Advertiser]]'', Morant, like all other volunteers, read and signed the following declaration:\n\n:We the undersigned, do hereby solemnly, sincerely and truly swear that we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]], her heirs and successors according to law, and that we will faithfully severally serve as members of the South Australian Volunteer Contingent enrolled for service in [[South Africa]], and we hereby severally bind ourselves from the 17th day of October 1899, until discharged to be subject to the provisions of the Army Act in force for the time being in [[British Army|Her Majesty's Army]], in like manner as if we had been severally and duly enlisted and attested for Her Majesty's Army for general service, and as if the said South Australian Volunteer Contingent formed part of Her Majesty's Army, and that we are in like manner during the same time severally to be subject to the Queen's rules and regulations, [[Articles of War#British Army|the rules and articles of war]], and to all such other rules and regulations and discipline of whatever nature or kind to which Her Majesty's Army is for the time being subject, and to all laws, rules and regulations in force within the Province of South Africa under the ''Defence Act 1895''; and also to all rules and regulations re: general orders and for any general officer commanding Her Majesty's forces in South Africa in which we may severally for the time be serving.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 203\">Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\nMorant was reportedly invited to visit the summer residence of [[South Australia]]'s governor, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]. After completing his training, he was appointed [[Lance Corporal|lance corporal]] and his [[regiment]] embarked for the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] on 26 January 1900.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29528172 |title=The Mounted Contingent |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 January 1900 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\nIn many respects, the terrain and climate of [[South Africa]] are similar to that of outback Australia, so Morant was in his element.  His superb horsemanship, expert bush skills and educated manner soon attracted the attention of his superiors. South Australian Colonel [[Joseph Maria Gordon|Joseph Gordon]] recommended him as a dispatch rider to [[Bennet Burleigh]], the [[war correspondent]] of the London ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''; the job reportedly provided Morant with ample opportunity to visit the nearby hospital and pursue dalliances with the nurses.\n\nA letter written on 23 January 1901 was sent to Admiral Sir George Morant by the [[Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel|Mount Nelson Hotel]] in [[Cape Town]] alleging that Sergeant Morant had stayed there during November 1900, while claiming to be the Admiral's son. \"The Breaker\" had further claimed to be a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and had \"left without discharging his liability\" of \u00a316/13s. The letter concluded, \"We shall esteem it a favour if you will let us know the course we had better adopt. We are adverse to taking the matter to court till we had heard from you.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 158.</ref>\n\nAccording to his co-defendant, Lieutenant [[George Witton]], Morant served with the South Australian Second Contingent for nine months, during which time he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nDuring March 1900, Sergeant Morant carried dispatches for the Flying Column to [[Prieska]], commanded by Colonel Lowe, 7th D.G., who was in the general advance to [[Bloemfontein]] and participated with the engagements of Karee Siding and Kroonstadt, and other engagements with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] until the entry into [[Pretoria]].  Morant was at the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]] and was then part of [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|General French]]'s staff, Cavalry Brigade, as war correspondent with [[Bennet Burleigh]] of the London ''Daily Telegraph''.  He accompanied that unit through [[Middelburg, Eastern Cape|Middelburg]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]] to the occupation of [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]].  At this point, he took leave and returned to England for six months. There, he befriended Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, and the two of them became engaged to a pair of sisters.\n\nCaptain Hunt, who was still \"signed on\", returned to South Africa to command the B [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of the Bushveldt [[Carbineer]]s, whereas Morant (who had intended that his military service end) followed him soon afterward not having found the forgiveness he sought in England.<ref>Citation needed !  WHAT \"forgiveness\" was that ?</ref> Originally, he returned to South Africa to accept a commission with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell's]] Transvaal Constabulary; he was convinced by Hunt to accept instead a commission with the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC).\n\nLieutenant Morant enlisted as a commissioned officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) on 1 April 1901.\n\n==The Bushveldt Carbineers==\nAfter their defeats in open battle during 1899\u20131900, the [[Boer Commando]]s began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Military campaign|campaign]] against both British and Commonwealth forces.  In response, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the British commander in South Africa, assembled and deployed a number of [[irregular military|irregular]] regiments to combat Boer [[commando]] units and protect British interests in the region. On his return from leave, Morant joined one of these irregular units, the Bushveldt Carbineers (or BVC), a 320-man regiment that had been formed and commanded during February 1901 by an Australian, Colonel Robert Lenehan.  After his friend's example, Captain Hunt joined the BVC soon after.\n\nThe regiment, based in [[Pietersburg]], {{convert|180|mi|km}} north of Pretoria, saw combat in the [[Spelonken]] region of the [[Northern Transvaal]] during 1901\u20131902.\n\nBy the summer of 1901, rumours had reached the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg \"of poor discipline, unconfirmed murders, drunkenness, and general lawlessness in the Spelonken.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 26.</ref> It was further alleged that a local woman had accused a British Army officer of [[sexual assault]]. Further investigation revealed that the alleged rapist was Captain James Robertson, the commanding officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers' A Squadron, based at Sweetwaters Farm. In response, Captain Robertson was recalled to HQ and given a choice between [[court martial]] and resigning his commission. Robertson submitted his resignation and quit the British Armed Forces.<ref>Leach (2012), page 23.</ref>\n\nIn response, Captain [[Percy Frederic Hunt]], \"an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\" was ordered to the Northern Transvaal and given command of the Bushveldt Carbineers \"B Squadron\". Before departing Pietersburg on the night of 11 July 1901, Captain Hunt successfully \"requested the transfer of certain officers and friends of his\" to his new field of command. These men included Lieutenants Morant, Charles Hannam, and Harry Picton.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Fort Edward==\nThe exact sequence and nature of the events resulting in Morant's arrest and trial are still disputed, and accounts vary considerably. While it seems certain that some members of the BVC were responsible for shooting Boer POWs and civilian noncombatants, the precise circumstances of these killings and the identities of those responsible will probably never be known for certain.  The following account is drawn mainly from the only surviving eyewitness source, and the 1907 book ''[[Scapegoats of the Empire]]'' by Lieutenant [[George Witton]],<ref>[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ViewPDF.aspx?B=8157064&D=D '''NAA: A1336, 227''': Copyright Application by George Ramsdale Whitton for ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', dated 7 August 1907, ''National Archives of Australia'', (contains photographs of each of the book's 240 pages).]</ref> one of the three Australians sentenced to death for the alleged murders and the only one to escape execution.\n\nWith Hunt now commanding the detachment at Fort Edward, discipline was immediately reimposed by Lieutenant Morant and Lieutenant Handcock, but this was resisted by some. In one incident, several members of a supply convoy commanded by Lieutenant Picton looted the rum it was carrying, resulting in their arrest for [[insubordination]] and for threatening to shoot Picton. They escaped to Pietersburg, but Captain Hunt sent a report to Colonel Lenehan, who had them detained. When the matter was brought before Colonel Hall, the commandant of Pietersburg, he ordered the offenders to be discharged from the regiment and released. In his book, Witton explicitly accused these disaffected troopers of being responsible for \"the monstrous and extravagant reports about the BVC which appeared later in the English and colonial press.\"\n\nBack at Fort Edward, the seized livestock<ref>What livestock ?</ref> were collected and given to the proper authorities and the stills<ref>What stills ?</ref> were destroyed, but according to Witton, these actions were resented by the perpetrators, and as a result Morant and Handcock were \"detested\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} by certain members of the detachment.<ref>This is a bob sequitor - it needs amplification</ref>\n\nWitton arrived at Fort Edward on 3 August with Sergeant Major Hammett and 30 men, and it was at this point that he met Morant and Handcock for the first time.\n\n==The Battle at Duivelskloof==\n===Prelude===\nAt the end of July 1901, the garrison at Fort Edward received a visit from the Reverend Fritz Reuter of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] and his family. Rev. Reuter was assigned to the Medingen Mission Station and, despite later claims by his family, he \"seems to have been an exception\" to the generally Republican sympathies \"of the Zoutpansberg German population\". In conversation with Captain Hunt, Rev. Reuter reported that Veldcornet Barend Viljoen's Commando was present at [[Duivelskloof]] and had been \"harassing local noncombatant farmers\". Rev. Reuter further alleged that his own mission station had been threatened. In response, Captain Hunt ordered a detachment under BVC Sergeant A.B.C. Cecil to protect the missionary and his family on their return journey.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nAfter Rev. Reuter's intelligence had been confirmed by a Native runner, Captain Hunt also learned that Sergeant Cecil's patrol had been ambushed near the Medingen Mission Station. In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. In addition to service personnel of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]], the patrol included Tony Schiel, a defector from the Zoutpansberg Commando and Intelligence Scout for Captain Taylor.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 38-39.</ref>\n\nIt was to be Schiel's task to command between 300 and 400 [[irregular military|irregulars]] drawn from the local [[Lobedu people]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received \"warnings and expressions of caution\" regarding \"the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night\" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Deciding to proceed anyway, Captain Hunt commanded \"his patrol into a situation that would echo through the next 100 years.\"<ref>Leach (2012), pages 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Ambush===\nAccording to the diary of BVC Trooper J.S. Silke, Rev. Reuter warned Hunt against attacking. The Viljoen farm, he explained, was built on a rocky hillside and \"was unassailable\". Furthermore, the nearby Botha farm contained more than 40 armed men who could easily intercept Hunt's line of retreat. Despite the warning and the fact that it was a bright moonlit night, Hunt chose to attack anyway.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-43.</ref>\n\nAfter planning a two-pronged attack, Captain Hunt ordered Trooper Silke to wait for a signal shot and rush the farmhouse from behind with 50 Lobedu warriors. Then, Captain Hunt approached the farmhouse via concrete steps terraced into the hillside.\n\nMeanwhile, the Viljoen Commando knew, according to Burgher Hendrik Adriaan Jacobs, that an attack was coming. Many commandos, however, were \"feverish\" from the effects of [[malaria]] and fatalistically waited for the arrival of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Jacobs later recalled how he saw Hunt's party through a window and began shooting. Possibly mistaking Jacobs's first shot for the signal, the BVC and the Lobedu also began shooting and general pandemonium ensued. In an exchange of fire, Captain Hunt was shot through the chest.  Sergeant Eland was killed attempting to go to Hunt's aid, as was at least one Lobedu warrior. On the Boer side, Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and G. Hartzenberg were killed. The dead of both sides were left behind by their retreating comrades.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-45.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWhen the surviving members of the patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter asked them about their officers and \"was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened\". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, \"My father roused on them, asking how they could leave their Captain like that.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 43.</ref>\n\nAccording to Leach, Captain Hunt's broken neck would be consistent with a fall down the concrete steps after being wounded. The mutilations found on his body were also found on the bodies of the three dead Boers. Both sides blamed the other for the disfigurement of the dead. Hendrik Jacobs, however, believed that Lobedu witch-doctors were to blame. According to historian Charles Leach, the mutilations do conform with accounts, by French anthropologist [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Junod]], of the traditional warfare practices of the Lobedu people.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 44-51.</ref>\n\nThe body of Captain Percy Hunt was buried at the Medingen Mission Station, where a cross was later installed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].  Sergeant Eland was buried at his family's homestead, the Ravenshill Farm, after a burial service was read by Rev. Reuter.\n\n==Revenge killings==\nWhen news of Hunt's death reached the fort, it had a profound effect on Morant; Witton said he became \"like a man demented\".<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400611.txt George Witton, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', Chapter IX \u2013 \"Death of Captain Hunt.--Morant's Reprisals\" (Project Gutenberg e-text edition)]</ref> Morant immediately ordered every available man out on patrol, became emotional while addressing the men, and ordered them to avenge the death of their captain and \"[[No quarter|give no quarter]]\".\n\nSignificantly, Morant did not see Hunt's body himself; according to Witton, Morant arrived about an hour after the burial. He questioned the men about Hunt's death and, convinced that his friend had been murdered in cold blood, he again vowed to give no quarter and take no prisoners.  Witton recounted that Morant then declared that he had, on occasion, ignored Hunt's order to this effect in the past, but that he would carry it out in the future.\n\n===Retaliation===\nThe next day, after leaving a few men to guard the mission (which the Boers threatened to burn in reprisal for harbouring the British), Morant commanded his unit back to the Viljoen farm.  It had been abandoned, so they tracked the retreating Boers all day, sighting them just at dusk. As the Australians closed in, the emotional Morant began shooting too early and they lost the element of surprise, so most of the Boers escaped. They did, however, capture one commando named Visser, wounded in the ankles so that he could not walk.\n\nThe next morning, as Morant and his men continued their pursuit, a native runner brought a message that the lightly-manned Fort Edward was in danger of being attacked by the Boers, so Morant decided to abandon the chase.\n\nAt this time, he searched and questioned Visser and found items of British uniform, including a pair of trousers which he believed was Hunt's, but which was later proved to be of much older origin. Morant then told Witton and others that he would have Visser shot at the first opportunity. When they stopped to eat around 11&nbsp;a.m., Morant again told Witton that he intended to have Visser shot, quoting orders \"direct from headquarters\" and citing Kitchener's recent alleged \"no prisoners\" proclamation. He called for a firing party, and although some of the men initially objected, Visser was made to sit down on an embankment (he could not stand), and was shot. After being shot, Visser was still alive, and Morant ordered Picton to administer a [[coup-de-grace]] with pistol shots to the head.\n\nOn the return journey to the fort, Morant's unit stopped for the night at the store of a British trader, a Mr Hays, who was well known for his hospitality.  After they left, Hays was raided by a party of Boers who looted everything he owned.  When Morant and his men arrived back at Fort Edward, they learned that a convoy under Lieutenant Neel had arrived from Pietersburg the previous day, just in time to reinforce Captain Taylor against a strong Boer force that attacked the fort. During the encounter, one Carbineer was wounded and several horses were shot. It was at this time that Taylor had a native shot, for refusing to give him information about the Boers' movements. Neel and Picton then returned to Pietersburg. <!-- what happened here?! -->\n\nOther killings followed. On 23 August, Morant commanded a small patrol to intercept a group of eight prisoners from Viljoen's commandos who were being brought in as prisoners; Morant ordered them to be taken to the side of the road and summarily shot. The South African born German missionary Reverend Predikant C.H.D. Heese spoke to the prisoners prior to the shooting.\n\nAbout a week later, reports began to circulate that Reverend Heese had been found shot along the Pietersburg road about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the fort on his way to Pietersburg to report the activities of Morant and his group to the British authorities. Soon afterwards, acting on a report that three armed Boer commandos were travelling to the fort, Morant took Handcock and several other men to intercept them. After the Boers surrendered with a white flag, they were taken prisoner, disarmed and shot.\n\nLater the same day, Major Lenehan arrived at Fort Edward for a rare visit. Morant persuaded Lenehan to let him command a strong patrol out to search for a small Boer unit commanded by [[Field Cornet|Field-cornet]] Kelly, an Irish-Boer commando whose farm was in the district. Kelly had fought against the British in the main actions of the war, and after returning to his home he had become a commando rather than surrender.\n\nMorant's patrol left Fort Edward on 16 September 1901 with orders from Lenehan that Kelly and his men were to be captured and brought back alive if possible. Covering {{convert|130|mi|km}} in a week of hard riding, they left their horses {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Kelly's [[laager]] and went the rest of the way on foot.  During the early hours of the next morning, Morant's patrol charged the laager, this time taking the Boers completely by surprise; Morant himself arrested Kelly at gunpoint at the door of his tent.  A week later, they returned to Fort Edward with the Kelly party and then escorted them safely to Pietersburg. The British commandant, Colonel Hall, sent Morant a message congratulating him on the success of his mission, after which Morant took two weeks' leave.\n\n==The letter==\nOn 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was dispatched secretly to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army [[Officer Commanding]] at [[Pietersburg]].

The shooting of six surrendered [[Afrikaner people|Afrikaner]] men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at [[Valdezia]] on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred Taylor]] and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been done by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 17-22, 99.</ref>\n\n:2. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. [[Peter Handcock]] on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had \"disapproved\" of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims' wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 22-23, 99.</ref>\n\n:3. The [[revenge killing]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt Morant had ordered his men to form a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] was delivered by BVC Lt Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at [[Duivelskloof]] on 6 August 1901.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 35-60, 100.</ref>\n\n:4. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. [[George Witton]], Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane's letter made no mention of the fact, three Native South African witnesses were also shot dead.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 61-72, 100.</ref>\n\n:The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]] of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese's driver, a member of the [[Southern Ndebele people]], was also killed.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 62-68, 73-82, 100.</ref>\n\n:5. The orders, given by BVC Lt Charles H.G. Hannam, to shoot at a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire caused the deaths of two boys, aged five and 13 years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 83-86, 100.</ref>\n\n:6. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 87-90, 100-101.</ref>\n\nThe letter then accused the [[Field Commander]] of the BVC, Major Robert Lenahan, of being \"privy to these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\" After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 100-101.</ref>\n\n==Arrest==\nIn response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Colonel Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and noncommissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97-98.</ref>\n\n==Indictments==\nAlthough the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, were later destroyed by the [[British civil service]],<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\">Leach (2012), page 104, 106.</ref> it is known that a Court of Inquiry, the British military's equivalent to a [[grand jury]], was convened on 16 October 1901. The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the [[Provost Marshal]] of Pietersburg. The first session of the Court occurred on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for further two weeks,<ref>Leach (2012), page 105.</ref> at which time it became known that the indictments would be as follows:\n\n:1. In what became known as \"The Six Boers Case\", Captains Robertson and Taylor, as well as Sgt. Maj.

St. Claire wrote, \"I agree generally with the  views expressed by the Court of Inquiry in the opinions of the several cases. The idea that no prisoners were to be taken in the Spelonken area appears to have been started by the late Captain Hunt & after his death continued by orders given personally by Captain Taylor.\n\n\"The statement that Captain Hunt's body had been maltreated is in no way corroborated & the reprisals undertaken by Lt Morant on this idea were utterly unjustifiable.\n\n\"Lieut Morant seems to have been the primary mover in carrying out these orders, & Lieut Handcock willingly lent himself out as the principle executioner of them.\n\n\"Lieut Morant acquiesced in the illegal execution of the wounded Boer Visser & took a personal part in the massacre of the 8 surrendered Boers on 23 August.\n\n\"The two N.C.O.s acted under orders but were not justified in obeying illegal commands. After the murder of Van Buuren the officers seem to have exercised a reign of terror in the District, which hindered their men from reporting their illegal acts & even prevented their objecting to assist in the crime.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 125\"/>\n\n==Court-martial==\n{{main|Court martial of Breaker Morant}}\n\nThe court-martial of Morant and his co-accused began on 16 January 1902 and was conducted in several stages. Two main hearings were conducted at Pietersburg in relatively relaxed conditions; one concerned the shooting of Visser, the other the \"Eight Boers\" case. A large number of depositions by members of the BVC were made, giving damning evidence against the accused. For example, a Trooper Thompson stated that, on the morning of the 23rd (1901), he saw a party of soldiers with eight Boers: \"Morant gave orders, and the prisoners were taken off the road and shot, Handcock killing two with his revolver. Morant later told me that we had to play into his hands, or else they would know what to expect.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} A Corporal Sharp said that he \"would walk 100 miles barefoot to serve in a firing squad to shoot Morant and Handcock.\"\n\nSoon after the second hearing, the prisoners were put in irons, taken to [[Pretoria]] while heavily guarded, and tried on the third main count, that of killing Reverend Heese. Although acquitted of killing Reverend Heese, Morant and his co-accused were quickly sentenced to death on the other two charges. Morant and Handcock were shot within days of sentencing, while Witton's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Lord Kitchener. Kitchener personally signed Morant and Handcock's [[execution warrant|death warrant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Field Marshal was absent on tour when the executions occurred.\n\n==Execution==\nDuring the day of 26 February, Morant and Handcock were visited by a distraught Major Thomas; Witton says that news of the impending execution had \"almost driven him crazy\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} Thomas then rushed away to find Kitchener and plead with him, but was informed by Colonel Kelly that the Commander-in-Chief was away and was not expected back for several days. Thomas pleaded with Kelly to have the executions stayed for a few days until he could appeal to the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King]], but was told that the sentences had already been referred to England \u2014 and confirmed \u2014 and that there was \"not the slightest hope\" of a reprieve; Morant and Handcock \"must pay for what he did\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to see a clergyman, Morant replied indignantly, \"No! I'm a [[Paganism|Pagan]]!\"<ref>Witton, Ch. XX \u2013 \"Execution of Morant and Handcock\"</ref>  On hearing this, Handcock asked, \"What's a Pagan?\" and after hearing the explanation, declared \"I'm a Pagan too!\" As the afternoon wore on, all the prisoners could clearly hear the sound of coffins being built in the nearby workshop. At 16:00 hours, Witton was told he would be leaving for England at five o'clock the next morning.\n\nThat night, Morant, Picton, Handcock and Witton had a last supper together; at Morant's request, he and Handcock were allowed to spend their last night in the same cell. Morant spent most of the night writing and then penned a final sardonic verse, and a confession which read\n\n:To the Rev.

The Australian government and Lieutenant Handcock's wife, who lived in Bathurst with their three children, learned of Handcock and Morant's deaths from the Australian newspapers weeks after their executions. After learning of his sentence, Lieutenant Witton arranged to send two telegrams, one to the Australian government representative in [[Pretoria]] and the other to a relative in Victoria, but despite assurances from the British, neither telegram was ever received.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Federation_of_Australia|newly federated Australian government]] demanded an explanation from Kitchener who, on 5 April 1902, sent a telegram to the Australian Governor-General, which was published in its entirety in the Australian press. It reads as follows:<ref name=argussenthome>{{Cite news | newspaper = The Argus | date = 7 April 1902 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9634927 | page = 5 | title = THE COURT-MARTIALLED AUSTRALIANS|via=nla.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n:In reply to your telegram, Morant, Handcock and Witton were charged with twenty separate murders, including one of a German missionary who had witnessed other murders. Twelve of these murders were proved. From the evidence it appears that Morant was the originator of these crimes which Handcock carried out in cold-blooded manner. The murders were committed in the wildest parts of the Transvaal, known as Spelonken, about eighty miles north of Pretoria, on four separate dates namely July 2, August 11, August 23, and September 7. In one case, where eight Boer prisoners were murdered, it was alleged to have been done in a spirit of revenge for the ill treatment of one of their officers \u2013 Captain Hunt \u2013 who was killed in action. No such ill-treatment was proved. The prisoners were convicted after a most exhaustive trial, and were defended by counsel. There were, in my opinion, no extenuating circumstances. Lieutenant Witton was also convicted but I commuted the sentence to penal servitude for life, in consideration of his having been under the influence of Morant and Handcock. The proceedings have been sent home.\n\nNews of the executions excited considerable public interest in the UK and a summary of the trial was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 18 April 1902, but the British government announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that, in keeping with normal practice, the court-martial proceedings would not be made public. During 1981, South African historian Dr. C.A.R. Schulenburg wrote to the [[Public Record Office]] and was informed by letter that the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, had \"been destroyed under statute\" by the [[British civil service]] between 1923 and 1958.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\"/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.\n\nGeorge Witton was transported to naval detention quarters in England and then to [[Lewes]] prison in [[Sussex]]. Some time later, he was transferred to the prison at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Dorset]], and was released after serving twenty-eight months. His release was notified to the British House of Commons on 10 August 1904.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/aug/10/ex-lieutenant-wittons-release#S4V0140P0_19040810_HOC_63 Hansard], HC 4ser vol 140 col 19.</ref> On his release he returned to Australia and for a while lived in [[Lancefield, Victoria]], where he wrote his controversial book about the Morant case.

Witton died in Australia during 1942.\n\n[[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] became a Native Commissioner in [[Rhodesia]] and died during 1941.\n\nThe Australian government was so resentful of this case that it insisted that none of its troops would be tried by the British military during World War I.<ref name=Jooste/>\n\n==Literature on Morant and conflicting theories about the case==\n\nMorant's life, exploits, trial and execution have been examined in several books and numerous press and internet articles, but as noted above, each account varies very considerably from the others in both the facts presented and their interpretation. There are facts intermingled with fiction.\n\nThe most important primary source, the official record of the court-martial, vanished after the trial, and its location remains a mystery. A report on the case from Kitchener to the Australian Governor-General (published in the Australian press on 7 April 1902) quotes Kitchener as saying that \"the proceedings have been sent home\" [i.e. to England].<ref name=argussenthome /> Whatever their actual fate, the transcripts have not been seen since the trial and evidently not even the Australian government was granted access to them.\n\nIn the 'Afterword' to the 1982 reprint of Witton's book, G.A. Embleton states that{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\n:...the British authorities have been approached by many researchers eager to examine the transcripts thought to be held by the War Office. Invariably these requests have been met with denials that the documents exist or pronouncements to the effect that they cannot be released until the year 2002 ... It now appears that the papers never reached England ... (it was) recently announced that the court-martial papers had been discovered in South Africa...\n\nA comprehensive record of the trial of Morant and Handcock, complete with a large number of depositions by members of the BVC and other witnesses of the deeds of Morant and Handcock, appears in Arthur Davey's publication \"Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers\" ([[Van Riebeeck Society]], Cape Town 1987).\n\nDuring 2012, South African historian Charles Leach published the book ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is DEAD and BURIED: A South African version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 \u2013 April 1902''. Based upon extensive research, Leach had complete access to unpublished South African sources and the papers of the Viljoen and Heese families.\n\nJoe West, a British Bushveldt Carbineers researcher, wrote in response: \"Charles Leach's impressive research has revealed that the crimes of Morant and his associates were worse than originally thought. In today's day and age Morant and Handcock plus several others would be arraigned before a War Crime Tribunal.\"\n\n===Primary sources===\n\nIn the absence of the original trial records, three primary sources remain. The first is the report of the trial printed in ''The Times'' during April 1902; the second is George Witton's account of the events of 1901\u201302, contained in his book ''Scapegoats of the Empire''. The third is a letter about the case, written by Witton to Major Thomas during 1929, which was kept secret at Witton's request until 1970. In it, Witton suggests that although Handcock confessed to the crimes, he did so under duress.\n\nMore recently, a diary written by [[Robert Poore]], the Provost Marshall at the time, was unearthed with a record for 7 October 1901.

(Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) Cutlack's story, said Wilcox, was based on Witton's ''Scapegoats'' and Frank Fox's ''Breaker Morant''.\n\nThe 1976 book ''The Australians At The Boer War'' by Australian writer R.L. Wallace gives a concise and reasonably detailed account of Morant's military career, trial and execution although it contains almost no information about Morant's earlier life and omits a number of significant details contained in Witton's account of the events resulting in Morant's trial. However, Wallace was writing an overall account of the Australians' role in South Africa, not the life of Morant, Handcock or Witton.\n\nThe most widely known book is the best-selling Australian novel ''The Breaker'' by [[Kit Denton]], first published in 1973 and inspired by Denton's meeting and conversation with a Boer War veteran who had known Morant. Wilcox suggested this book is a follow-on from Cutlack's book and helped establish the myth. (Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) However, Denton claimed that Morant and Handcock were executed in Pietersburg and buried near that spot. This mistake appeared in his book as late as 1981 (7th edition, p.&nbsp;268), and is a possible reason as to why there is confusion about the location of the execution, i.e., Pretoria or Pietersburg.\n\n[[Kenneth G. Ross|Kenneth Ross]]'s 1978 successful and widely acclaimed play ''[[Breaker Morant (play)|Breaker Morant: A Play in Two Acts]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7267-0997-2}}), was adapted by Ross and [[Bruce Beresford]] into Beresford's 1980 movie ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. The movie was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay#1980s|1980 Academy Award for a screenplay adapted from another source]].\n\nDuring 1988 in the small town of Burra, South Australia, where Bruce Beresford's movie 'Breaker Morant' was filmed, David Jennings organized a 'Retrial of Morant, Handcock and Witton'. The townsfolk staged the retrial and generated the imagination of people from all over the world. Much archival material which had been gathering dust in attics was submitted. Although the three Justices of the Peace who presided over the 'Retrial' found all three not guilty on the balance of probabilities that Kitchener had issued the orders to execute Boers in khaki only a diary extract from a deceased Australian Staff Officer on Kitchener's staff indicated that he had verbally instructed Captain Hunt and the Bushveldt Carbineers to execute prisoners, especially those wearing khaki.\n\n===Legacy===\n\nAlthough it is generally accepted that Morant and/or others in his regiment were responsible for the deaths of a number of Boer commandos, historical opinion is still divided over the main questions of the case \u2014 how many Boers were killed, by whom were they killed, and on whose orders? In his book, ''Born to Fight'', Neil Speed has photos of a number of Canadian Scouts wearing black feathers (pp.&nbsp;105 & 119.), a symbol that they would shoot any armed Boer they captured.\n\nMorant's devotees, however, argue that he and Handcock were unfairly singled out for punishment even though many other British soldiers were known to have committed summary executions of Boer prisoners. In their opinion, the two Australians were made scapegoats by the British, who were intent on concealing the existence of the \"take no prisoners\" policy against Boer insurgents \u2014 a policy which, they claim, had been promulgated by Kitchener himself.\n\nHowever, Hamish Paterson, a South African military historian and a member of the Military History Society, has emphasised that the Bushveldt Carbineers were a British Imperial unit, not an Australian one: technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers.\n\nA 2002 book by Nick Bleszynski, ''Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant'', promoted the \"scapegoat\" argument.<ref>Bleszynski, Nick (2002), ''<nowiki>'Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant</nowiki>''. Random House Australia. {{ISBN|1-74051-081-X}}. (Novel)</ref> It said that while Morant and the others probably committed some crimes and may well have deserved disciplinary action, there is now persuasive evidence from several sources to show that the Kitchener 'no prisoners' order did indeed exist, that it was widely known among both the British and Australian troops and was performed by many disparate units. It also asserted that the court-martial's procedures were flawed.\n\nThe graves of Morant and Handcock were left unattended for many years, but after the release of Beresford's movie it became a popular place of pilgrimage for Australian tourists.  During June 1998, the Australian Government spent $1,500 refurbishing the gravesite with a new concrete slab. The marble cross which stood over the grave had been vandalised, as had many other gravestones nearby.\n\nA series of monuments now mark the locations of some of the incidents, including that of the night attack, and the site of the mass grave of eight burghers.<ref name=zoutnet>{{cite news|last1=van der Westhuizen |first1=Linda |title=Monument honours those who died |url=http://www.zoutnet.co.za/articles/news/11614/2012-01-27/monument-honours-those-who-died |accessdate=28 September 2015 |website=www.zoutnet.co.za|agency=Zoutnet |date=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Petition==\n{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}\n\nDuring 2002, a group of Australians travelled to South Africa and held a service at the Pretoria graveside to commemorate the execution on the morning of its hundredth anniversary.  The service was also attended by the Australian [[High Commissioner]] to South Africa.  The group left a new marker on the grave.\n\nA petition to pardon Morant and Handcock was sent to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during February 2010.  The petition has been severely criticised in South Africa, specifically by descendants of the Viljoen brothers who were killed in the skirmish with Hunt and Eland and by the descendants of the family of Rev. Heese.\n\nHamish Paterson states:  \"I don\u2019t think they [the Australian supporters of a Morant pardon] have actually considered what Morant was convicted of. Let's start off with the laws of war. If for example, we have a surrender. You want to surrender and I don\u2019t accept your surrender, so I choose not to accept it, that I\u2019m entitled to do. [...] However, the situation changes dramatically once I accept your surrender, then I must remove you from the battlefield to a POW camp and keep you safe. If, for example, Kitchener said, \"take no prisoners\", that was very different from \"shoot prisoners!\" So Morant and Handcock made two very basic errors: Once you\u2019ve accepted the surrender, you take them to the railway line and get them shipped off to Bermuda, or wherever. At that point, the sensible thing to do was to ship them off to a POW camp. The next error was to shoot these guys in front of a neutral witness, and then you kill the witness. These are a series of terrible errors of judgement. Because they killed a German missionary, the Kaiser (became) involved. [...] Technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers. The problem was you were dealing with an unstable set-up in the BVC . It had just been formed. I don\u2019t see a regular Australian unit behaving that way. I rather suspect why no British guys were shot was that they were either regular army or militia, or yeomanry, all of which are very unlikely to actually shoot prisoners. I think no British were shot because they hadn\u2019t made the mistake of shooting prisoners who\u2019d already surrendered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/287483|title=South African Historian Against Royal Pardon For \u2018Breaker\u2019 Morant|author=Szabo, Christopher|website=www.digitaljournal.com|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>\n\nJim Unkles, an Australian lawyer, submitted two petitions during October 2009, one to Queen Elizabeth II and the other to the House of Representatives Petitions Committee, to review the convictions and sentences of Morant, Handcock, and Witton.

Although its provenance is obscure (Thomas died on 11 November, 1942) it is believed that the bag had originally come from the former home of James Thomas, the Tenterfield solicitor who defended Morant and his colleagues at their court martial. The items found included a number of personal effects engraved with Morant's name and/or his initials, including a penny on a leather thong, engraved with his name, which has a roughly circular nick on the edge. Although it cannot be confirmed, it is speculated that Morant was wearing the penny (an early form of 'dog tag') at the moment he was shot and that the nick was caused by the passage of one of the bullets that killed him. Other Morant effects contained in the bag included fragments of a trumpet, a bayonet scabbard, a bandolier (believed to be the one Morant wore in his famous photo portrait), a cigarette case (thought to be the one Morant gave to Thomas just before he was shot), brass drinking cups engraved with the initials HM, army field mess equipment, and a Boer War medal. The cache also included an Australian red ensign which is thought to be the same flag that is seen draping Morant and Handcock's grave in the famous photograph of Thomas standing by the burial plot. The ensign had been signed by Thomas in ink on one of the white stars and has the following inscription:\n\n\"This flag bore witness [to] utter scapegoats of the Empire Feb 27 1902 Pretoria.\"\n\n\"Signed J F Thomas.\"\n\n\"Handcock Feb 17 1868 Feb 27 1902 RIP.\"\n\n\"Lt Henry H Morant Dec 9 1864 Feb 27 1902 Pretoria RIP.\"\n\nThe bag also contained newspaper clippings and books and papers pertaining to [[Sir Henry Parkes]] and the Australian Federation process. Unfortunately, a significant quantity of badly damaged documents found in the bag were discarded by the anonymous finder before he realised the significance of the trove. The anonymous finder \u2013 known only as \"Mr Collector\" \u2013 subsequently donated the items to Tenterfield's Henry Parkes School of Arts museum, where they are now on public display.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/breaker-morant-relics-found-on-rubbish-tip-20160422-gocn1a.html|title=Breaker Morant relics found on rubbish tip|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=22 April 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Horse Memorial]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=Davey| first=Arthur| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18997618| title=Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers| publication-date=1987| publisher=Van Riebeeck Society| isbn=978-0-620-12485-0}}\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=George| first=Dave C| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9581857| title=Carvings from the Veldt : a pictorial history of rifle stock art from the Anglo Boer War 1899-1902| publication-date=2004 | publisher=Dave C.

This is particularly the case when there is a need to determine whether tumors are of [[primary tumor|primary]] or [[metastasis|metastatic]] origin. To make this distinction, researchers can screen the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] alterations found on cells located in the primary tumor site against those found in the secondary site.

Here biomarkers can be useful in determining the aggressiveness of an identified cancer as well as its likelihood of responding to a given treatment. In part, this is because tumors exhibiting particular biomarkers may be responsive to treatments tied to that biomarker's expression or presence.

differences in each person's genetic makeup, some people metabolize or change the chemical structure of drugs differently. In some cases, decreased metabolism of certain drugs can create dangerous conditions in which high levels of the drug accumulate in the body. As such, drug dosing decisions in particular cancer treatments can benefit from screening for such biomarkers. An example is the gene encoding the enzyme [[TPMT|thiopurine methyl-transferase (TPMPT)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Karas-Kuzelicki|first=N|author2=Mlinaric-Rascan, I|title=Individualization of thiopurine therapy: thiopurine S-methyltransferase and beyond.|journal=Pharmacogenomics|date=August 2009|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1309\u201322|pmid=19663675|doi=10.2217/pgs.09.78}}</ref> Individuals with mutations in the TPMT gene are unable to metabolize large amounts of the [[leukemia]] drug, [[mercaptopurine]], which potentially causes a fatal drop in [[white blood cell|white blood]] count for such patients.

In such melanomas, [[melanocytes]], the cells that make pigment in our skin, produce the protein S100-beta in high concentrations dependent on the number of cancer cells.

The [http://www.oncotypedx.com/ Oncotype DX\u00ae] breast cancer assay is one such test used to predict the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence. Thist test is intended for women with [[Cancer staging|early-stage]] (Stage I or II), node-negative, [[estrogen receptor]]-positive (ER+) invasive breast cancer who will be treated with [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]].

For instance, in the 1960s, researchers discovered the majority of patients with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] possessed a particular genetic abnormality on [[chromosome]]s 9 and 22 dubbed the [[Philadelphia chromosome]]. When these two chromosomes combine they create a cancer-causing gene known as [[BCR-ABL]]. In such patients, this gene acts as the principle initial point in all of the physiological manifestations of the leukemia. For many years, the BCR-ABL was simply used as a biomarker to stratify a certain subtype of leukemia. However, drug developers were eventually able to develop [[imatinib]], a powerful drug that effectively inhibited this protein and significantly decreased production of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=MD|author2=McKeage, K |author3=Plosker, GL |author4= Siddiqui, MA |title=Imatinib: a review of its use in chronic myeloid leukaemia.|journal=Drugs|year=2007|volume=67|issue=2|pages=299\u2013320|pmid=17284091 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767020-00010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lemonick|first=Michael|title=New Hope for Cancer|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999978,00.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=May 28, 2001|author2=Alice Park}}</ref>\n\n====Surrogate endpoints====\nAnother promising area of biomarker application is in the area of [[surrogate endpoint]]s. In this application, biomarkers act as stand-ins for the effects of a drug on cancer progression and survival. Ideally, the use of validated biomarkers would prevent patients from having to undergo tumor [[biopsy|biopsies]] and lengthy [[clinical trial]]s to determine if a new drug worked. In the current standard of care, the metric for determining a drug's effectiveness is to check if it has decreased cancer progression in humans and ultimately whether it prolongs survival. However, successful biomarker surrogates could save substantial time, effort, and money if failing drugs could be eliminated from the development pipeline before being brought to clinical trials.\n\nSome ideal characteristics of surrogate endpoint biomarkers include:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Price|first=C|author2=McDonnell, D|title=Effects of niobium filtration and constant potential on the sensitometric responses of dental radiographic films.|journal=Dentomaxillofacial Radiology|date=February 1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=11\u20136|pmid=1884846|doi=10.1259/dmfr.20.1.1884846}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Victor|author2=Fadlo Khuri|title=Progress in Lung Cancer Chemoprevention|journal=Cancer Control|year=2003|volume=10|issue=4|pages=315\u2013324|url=http://aamhf.com/CCJRoot/v10n4/pdf/315.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2013|doi=10.1177/107327480301000406|pmid=12915810}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Biomarker should be involved in process that causes the cancer\n* Changes in biomarker should correlate with changes in the disease\n* Levels of biomarkers should be high enough that they can be measured easily and reliably\n* Levels or presence of biomarker should readily distinguish between normal, cancerous, and precancerous tissue\n* Effective treatment of the cancer should change the level of the biomarker\n* Level of the biomarker should not change spontaneously or in response to other factors not related to the successful treatment of the cancer\n\nTwo areas in particular that are receiving attention as surrogate markers include [[circulating tumor cell|circulating tumor cells (CTCs)]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=CY|author2=Tsai, HL |author3=Uen, YH |author4=Hu, HM |author5=Chen, CW |author6=Cheng, TL |author7=Lin, SR |author8= Wang, JY |title=Circulating tumor cells as a surrogate marker for determining clinical outcome to mFOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer.|journal=British Journal of Cancer|date=Mar 5, 2013|volume=108|issue=4|pages=791\u20137|pmid=23422758|doi=10.1038/bjc.2012.595 |pmc=3590657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Balic|first=M|author2=Williams, A |author3=Lin, H |author4=Datar, R |author5= Cote, RJ |title=Circulating tumor cells: from bench to bedside.|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=2013|volume=64|pages=31\u201344|pmid=23092385|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-050311-163404 |pmc=3809995}}</ref> and circulating [[microRNA|miRNAs]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madhavan|first=D |author2=Zucknick, M |author3=Wallwiener, M |author4=Cuk, K |author5=Modugno, C |author6=Scharpff, M |author7=Schott, S |author8=Heil, J |author9=Turchinovich, A |author10=Yang, R |author11=Benner, A |author12=Riethdorf, S |author13=Trumpp, A |author14=Sohn, C |author15=Pantel, K |author16=Schneeweiss, A |author17=Burwinkel, B |title=Circulating miRNAs as surrogate markers for circulating tumor cells and prognostic markers in metastatic breast cancer.|journal=Clinical Cancer Research |date=Nov 1, 2012|volume=18|issue=21|pages=5972\u201382|pmid=22952344|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1407|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Redova|first=M|author2=Sana, J |author3=Slaby, O |title=Circulating miRNAs as new blood-based biomarkers for solid cancers.|journal=Future Oncology |date=March 2013|volume=9|issue=3|pages=387\u2013402|pmid=23469974|doi=10.2217/fon.12.192}}</ref> Both these markers are associated with the number of [[tumor]] cells present in the blood, and as such, are hoped to provide a surrogate for tumor progression and [[metastasis]].

Some biomarkers found in the circulatory system can be used to determine an abnormal growth of cells present in the body. All these types of biomarkers can be identified through diagnostic blood tests, which is one of the main reasons to get regularly health tested. By getting regularly tested, many health issues such as cancer can be discovered at an early stage, preventing many deaths.\n\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has been shown to be a non-specific determinant for many cancers.

This is particularly the case when there is a need to determine whether tumors are of [[primary tumor|primary]] or [[metastasis|metastatic]] origin. To make this distinction, researchers can screen the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] alterations found on cells located in the primary tumor site against those found in the secondary site. If the alterations match, the secondary tumor can be identified as metastatic; whereas if the alterations differ, the secondary tumor can be identified as a distinct primary tumor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=PP|author2=Rezai, B |author3=Koch, WM |author4=Reed, A |author5=Eisele, D |author6=Lee, DJ |author7=Sidransky, D |author8=Jen, J |author9= Westra, WH  |title=Distinguishing second primary tumors from lung metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|date=Jul 1, 1998|volume=90|issue=13|pages=972\u20137|pmid=9665144 |doi=10.1093/jnci/90.13.972|doi-access=free}}</ref> For example, people with tumors have high levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) due to tumor cells that have gone through apoptosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lapin|first=Morten|last2=Oltedal|first2=Satu|last3=Tjensvoll|first3=Kjersti|last4=Buhl|first4=Tove|last5=Smaaland|first5=Rune|last6=Garresori|first6=Herish|last7=Javle|first7=Milind|last8=Glenjen|first8=Nils Idar|last9=Abelseth|first9=Bente Kristin|last10=Gilje|first10=Bj\u00f8rnar|last11=Nordg\u00e5rd|first11=Oddmund|date=2018-11-06|title=Fragment size and level of cell-free DNA provide prognostic information in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-018-1677-2|journal=Journal of Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=300|doi=10.1186/s12967-018-1677-2|issn=1479-5876|pmc=6218961|pmid=30400802}}</ref> This tumor marker can be detected in the blood, saliva, or urine.<ref name=\"Li 596\u2013607\"/>\n\n====Prognosis and treatment predictions====\nAnother use of biomarkers in cancer medicine is for disease [[prognosis]], which take place after an individual has been diagnosed with cancer.

differences in each person's genetic makeup, some people metabolize or change the chemical structure of drugs differently. In some cases, decreased metabolism of certain drugs can create dangerous conditions in which high levels of the drug accumulate in the body.

An example is the gene encoding the enzyme [[TPMT|thiopurine methyl-transferase (TPMPT)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Karas-Kuzelicki|first=N|author2=Mlinaric-Rascan, I|title=Individualization of thiopurine therapy: thiopurine S-methyltransferase and beyond.|journal=Pharmacogenomics|date=August 2009|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1309\u201322|pmid=19663675|doi=10.2217/pgs.09.78}}</ref> Individuals with mutations in the TPMT gene are unable to metabolize large amounts of the [[leukemia]] drug, [[mercaptopurine]], which potentially causes a fatal drop in [[white blood cell|white blood]] count for such patients.

Thist test is intended for women with [[Cancer staging|early-stage]] (Stage I or II), node-negative, [[estrogen receptor]]-positive (ER+) invasive breast cancer who will be treated with [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]].

For instance, in the 1960s, researchers discovered the majority of patients with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] possessed a particular genetic abnormality on [[chromosome]]s 9 and 22 dubbed the [[Philadelphia chromosome]]. When these two chromosomes combine they create a cancer-causing gene known as [[BCR-ABL]]. In such patients, this gene acts as the principle initial point in all of the physiological manifestations of the leukemia. For many years, the BCR-ABL was simply used as a biomarker to stratify a certain subtype of leukemia. However, drug developers were eventually able to develop [[imatinib]], a powerful drug that effectively inhibited this protein and significantly decreased production of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=MD|author2=McKeage, K |author3=Plosker, GL |author4= Siddiqui, MA |title=Imatinib: a review of its use in chronic myeloid leukaemia.|journal=Drugs|year=2007|volume=67|issue=2|pages=299\u2013320|pmid=17284091 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767020-00010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lemonick|first=Michael|title=New Hope for Cancer|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999978,00.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=May 28, 2001|author2=Alice Park}}</ref>\n\n====Surrogate endpoints====\nAnother promising area of biomarker application is in the area of [[surrogate endpoint]]s. In this application, biomarkers act as stand-ins for the effects of a drug on cancer progression and survival. Ideally, the use of validated biomarkers would prevent patients from having to undergo tumor [[biopsy|biopsies]] and lengthy [[clinical trial]]s to determine if a new drug worked. In the current standard of care, the metric for determining a drug's effectiveness is to check if it has decreased cancer progression in humans and ultimately whether it prolongs survival. However, successful biomarker surrogates could save substantial time, effort, and money if failing drugs could be eliminated from the development pipeline before being brought to clinical trials.\n\nSome ideal characteristics of surrogate endpoint biomarkers include:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Price|first=C|author2=McDonnell, D|title=Effects of niobium filtration and constant potential on the sensitometric responses of dental radiographic films.|journal=Dentomaxillofacial Radiology|date=February 1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=11\u20136|pmid=1884846|doi=10.1259/dmfr.20.1.1884846}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Victor|author2=Fadlo Khuri|title=Progress in Lung Cancer Chemoprevention|journal=Cancer Control|year=2003|volume=10|issue=4|pages=315\u2013324|url=http://aamhf.com/CCJRoot/v10n4/pdf/315.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2013|doi=10.1177/107327480301000406|pmid=12915810}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Biomarker should be involved in process that causes the cancer\n* Changes in biomarker should correlate with changes in the disease\n* Levels of biomarkers should be high enough that they can be measured easily and reliably\n* Levels or presence of biomarker should readily distinguish between normal, cancerous, and precancerous tissue\n* Effective treatment of the cancer should change the level of the biomarker\n* Level of the biomarker should not change spontaneously or in response to other factors not related to the successful treatment of the cancer\n\nTwo areas in particular that are receiving attention as surrogate markers include [[circulating tumor cell|circulating tumor cells (CTCs)]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=CY|author2=Tsai, HL |author3=Uen, YH |author4=Hu, HM |author5=Chen, CW |author6=Cheng, TL |author7=Lin, SR |author8= Wang, JY |title=Circulating tumor cells as a surrogate marker for determining clinical outcome to mFOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer.|journal=British Journal of Cancer|date=Mar 5, 2013|volume=108|issue=4|pages=791\u20137|pmid=23422758|doi=10.1038/bjc.2012.595 |pmc=3590657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Balic|first=M|author2=Williams, A |author3=Lin, H |author4=Datar, R |author5= Cote, RJ |title=Circulating tumor cells: from bench to bedside.|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=2013|volume=64|pages=31\u201344|pmid=23092385|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-050311-163404 |pmc=3809995}}</ref> and circulating [[microRNA|miRNAs]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madhavan|first=D |author2=Zucknick, M |author3=Wallwiener, M |author4=Cuk, K |author5=Modugno, C |author6=Scharpff, M |author7=Schott, S |author8=Heil, J |author9=Turchinovich, A |author10=Yang, R |author11=Benner, A |author12=Riethdorf, S |author13=Trumpp, A |author14=Sohn, C |author15=Pantel, K |author16=Schneeweiss, A |author17=Burwinkel, B |title=Circulating miRNAs as surrogate markers for circulating tumor cells and prognostic markers in metastatic breast cancer.|journal=Clinical Cancer Research |date=Nov 1, 2012|volume=18|issue=21|pages=5972\u201382|pmid=22952344|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1407|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Redova|first=M|author2=Sana, J |author3=Slaby, O |title=Circulating miRNAs as new blood-based biomarkers for solid cancers.|journal=Future Oncology |date=March 2013|volume=9|issue=3|pages=387\u2013402|pmid=23469974|doi=10.2217/fon.12.192}}</ref> Both these markers are associated with the number of [[tumor]] cells present in the blood, and as such, are hoped to provide a surrogate for tumor progression and [[metastasis]].

Some biomarkers found in the circulatory system can be used to determine an abnormal growth of cells present in the body. All these types of biomarkers can be identified through diagnostic blood tests, which is one of the main reasons to get regularly health tested. By getting regularly tested, many health issues such as cancer can be discovered at an early stage, preventing many deaths.\n\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has been shown to be a non-specific determinant for many cancers.
