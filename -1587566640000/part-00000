It is the eighth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars <!-- Casting is per the billing block. Do NOT change. -->[[Matt Passmore]], [[Callum Keith Rennie]], [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]], and Hannah Emily Anderson. The film picks up over a decade after the death of the eponymous [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw killer]], during the police investigation of a new succession of murders that fit his ''[[modus operandi]]''.\n\n2010's ''[[Saw 3D]]'' was originally deemed the final installment of the series, before [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] commissioned the production of ''Jigsaw'' from a pitch by Stolberg and Goldfinger.\n\nFilming began in November 2016, with post-production following in January. The film was released in the United States on October 27, 2017, by Lionsgate. ''Jigsaw'' received mostly unfavorable reviews<!-- The Metacritic rating states \"unfavorable reviews\". There is no source for \"mixed reviews\". --> from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $102.9 million worldwide against a $10 million budget. It will be followed by a ninth installment, [[Spiral (2020 film)|''Spiral'']], in 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after [[Saw III|the death of John Kramer]], criminal Edgar Munsen is shot and apprehended by Detectives Hunt and Halloran after activating a [[Triggering device|remote trigger]]. Meanwhile, five people \u2013 Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man \u2013 are held captive in a barn with chains around their necks. A tape recording from John Kramer explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and confess their sins. The chains pull them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survive by cutting themselves to offer blood, but the unconscious man awakens too late to escape.\n\nTheir next test reveals that Carly is a [[theft|purse snatcher]], who accidentally caused the death of an [[Asthma|asthmatic woman]]. To save the others from being [[Hanging|hanged]], she must inject herself with one of three needles \u2013 one containing an antidote to a [[poison]] in her system, one containing [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], and one containing [[acid]]. She refuses, so Ryan stabs her with all three to save himself, killing her.\n\nHalloran and Detective Hunt investigate the discovery of bodies that appear to be the unconscious man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of [[pathology|pathologists]] Logan Nelson, who is a [[veteran]] and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Later, Munsen goes missing from the hospital. His body is found inside John's grave when it is exhumed by the police.\n\nRyan attempts to escape through a door with the words \"No Exit\" on it, but his leg crashes through loose floorboards, and is ensnared by wires. A tape recorder found next to his leg reveal that he is being punished for breaking the rules and that he must pull a lever to sever his leg and be \"set free\". Exploring the room, Anna and Mitch walk inside a [[silo]] and are trapped inside. A recording reveals they will be killed unless Ryan pulls the lever. Ryan pulls the lever, severing his leg, while saving Anna and Mitch.\n\nEleanor reveals to Logan that she is a [[fandom|fangirl]] of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of many of his traps in her [[studio]]. She is worried this might incriminate her. Hunt follows them and informs Halloran.\n\nThe next test reveals Mitch sold a [[motorcycle]] with a faulty brake to John's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be killed by a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach a [[Parking brake|brake]]. Anna attempts to help him, but he is killed. Halloran finds a corpse appearing to be Mitch in Eleanor\u2019s studio and calls for Logan and Eleanor\u2019s arrest.\n\nLogan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran. Eleanor deduces the game's location and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them. Meanwhile, Hunt finds pieces of flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] and implicating Halloran as the killer.\n\nAnna is drugged while attempting to escape, and awakens to find herself and Ryan chained in a room with a still-living John Kramer. John reveals that Anna [[Infanticide|suffocated her baby]] and [[Frameup|framed her husband]] while Ryan caused the death of several friends in a car accident. John tells them they have gotten his message backwards. He places a shotgun between them and tells them it is the key to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun [[Booby trap|backfires and kills her]]. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun and were destroyed when Anna fired it, leaving him to die.\n\nLogan and Eleanor are ambushed by Halloran at the barn. Eleanor escapes, while Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with [[Laser cutting|laser cutters]]. They are told to confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled John's x-rays years prior, causing his [[cancer]] to go undiagnosed. Despite confessing, Logan is killed. Then, Halloran admits to allowing criminals to walk free for personal gain and his collar deactivates.\n\nLogan reveals that he is still alive and that the barn games occurred [[Nonlinear narrative|ten years prior]]. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but John, having decided Logan shouldn't die over an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him as his first [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free, which Logan placed into the same tests that took place at Tuck's Pig Farm ten years ago. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, killed his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules and forced Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the killer. Logan reactivates the collar around Halloran's neck, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Matt Passmore]] as [[List of Saw characters#Logan Nelson|Logan Nelson]]\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Halloran|Detective Halloran]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Keith Hunt|Detective Keith Hunt]]\n* Hannah Emily Anderson as [[List of Saw characters#Eleanor Bonneville|Eleanor Bonneville]]\n* [[Laura Vandervoort]] as [[List of Saw characters#Anna|Anna]]\n* [[Paul Braunstein]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jigsaw|Ryan]]\n* [[Mandela Van Peebles]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mitch|Mitch]]\n* [[Brittany Allen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carly|Carly]]\n* Josiah Black as [[List of Saw characters#Edgar Munsen|Edgar Munsen]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' was intended to be the final ''Saw'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The film was set to be split into two parts, but [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] only allowed the filmmakers to make one more film after ''[[Saw VI]]'' under-performed at the box office.

It is the eighth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars <!-- Casting is per the billing block. Do NOT change. -->[[Matt Passmore]], [[Callum Keith Rennie]], [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]], and Hannah Emily Anderson. The film picks up over a decade after the death of the eponymous [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw killer]], during the police investigation of a new succession of murders that fit his ''[[modus operandi]]''.\n\n2010's ''[[Saw 3D]]'' was originally deemed the final installment of the series, before [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] commissioned the production of ''Jigsaw'' from a pitch by Stolberg and Goldfinger.\n\nFilming began in November 2016, with post-production following in January. The film was released in the United States on October 27, 2017, by Lionsgate. ''Jigsaw'' received mostly unfavorable reviews<!-- The Metacritic rating states \"unfavorable reviews\". There is no source for \"mixed reviews\". --> from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $102.9 million worldwide against a $10 million budget. It will be followed by a ninth installment, [[Spiral (2020 film)|''Spiral'']], in 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after [[Saw III|the death of John Kramer]], criminal Edgar Munsen is shot and apprehended by Detectives Hunt and Halloran after activating a [[Triggering device|remote trigger]]. Meanwhile, five people \u2013 Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man \u2013 are held captive in a barn with chains around their necks. A tape recording from John Kramer explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and confess their sins. The chains pull them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survive by cutting themselves to offer blood, but the unconscious man awakens too late to escape.\n\nTheir next test reveals that Carly is a [[theft|purse snatcher]], who accidentally caused the death of an [[Asthma|asthmatic woman]]. To save the others from being [[Hanging|hanged]], she must inject herself with one of three needles \u2013 one containing an antidote to a [[poison]] in her system, one containing [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], and one containing [[acid]]. She refuses, so Ryan stabs her with all three to save himself, killing her.\n\nHalloran and Detective Hunt investigate the discovery of bodies that appear to be the unconscious man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of [[pathology|pathologists]] Logan Nelson, who is a [[veteran]] and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Later, Munsen goes missing from the hospital. His body is found inside John's grave when it is exhumed by the police.\n\nRyan attempts to escape through a door with the words \"No Exit\" on it, but his leg crashes through loose floorboards, and is ensnared by wires. A tape recorder found next to his leg reveal that he is being punished for breaking the rules and that he must pull a lever to sever his leg and be \"set free\". Exploring the room, Anna and Mitch walk inside a [[silo]] and are trapped inside. A recording reveals they will be killed unless Ryan pulls the lever. Ryan pulls the lever, severing his leg, while saving Anna and Mitch.\n\nEleanor reveals to Logan that she is a [[fandom|fangirl]] of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of many of his traps in her [[studio]]. She is worried this might incriminate her. Hunt follows them and informs Halloran.\n\nThe next test reveals Mitch sold a [[motorcycle]] with a faulty brake to John's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be killed by a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach a [[Parking brake|brake]]. Anna attempts to help him, but he is killed. Halloran finds a corpse appearing to be Mitch in Eleanor\u2019s studio and calls for Logan and Eleanor\u2019s arrest.\n\nLogan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran. Eleanor deduces the game's location and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them. Meanwhile, Hunt finds pieces of flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] and implicating Halloran as the killer.\n\nAnna is drugged while attempting to escape, and awakens to find herself and Ryan chained in a room with a still-living John Kramer. John reveals that Anna [[Infanticide|suffocated her baby]] and [[Frameup|framed her husband]] while Ryan caused the death of several friends in a car accident. John tells them they have gotten his message backwards. He places a shotgun between them and tells them it is the key to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun [[Booby trap|backfires and kills her]]. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun and were destroyed when Anna fired it, leaving him to die.\n\nLogan and Eleanor are ambushed by Halloran at the barn. Eleanor escapes, while Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with [[Laser cutting|laser cutters]]. They are told to confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled John's x-rays years prior, causing his [[cancer]] to go undiagnosed. Despite confessing, Logan is killed. Then, Halloran admits to allowing criminals to walk free for personal gain and his collar deactivates.\n\nLogan reveals that he is still alive and that the barn games occurred [[Nonlinear narrative|ten years prior]]. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but John, having decided Logan shouldn't die over an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him as his first [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free, which Logan placed into the same tests that took place at Tuck's Pig Farm ten years ago. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, killed his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules and forced Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the killer. Logan reactivates the collar around Halloran's neck, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Matt Passmore]] as [[List of Saw characters#Logan Nelson|Logan Nelson]]\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Halloran|Detective Halloran]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Keith Hunt|Detective Keith Hunt]]\n* Hannah Emily Anderson as [[List of Saw characters#Eleanor Bonneville|Eleanor Bonneville]]\n* [[Laura Vandervoort]] as [[List of Saw characters#Anna|Anna]]\n* [[Paul Braunstein]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jigsaw|Ryan]]\n* [[Mandela Van Peebles]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mitch|Mitch]]\n* [[Brittany Allen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carly|Carly]]\n* Josiah Black as [[List of Saw characters#Edgar Munsen|Edgar Munsen]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' was intended to be the final ''Saw'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The film was set to be split into two parts, but [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] only allowed the filmmakers to make one more film after ''[[Saw VI]]'' under-performed at the box office.

Hyphae are branching structures that release enzymes to absorb nutrients from the host.\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\n''Armillaria'' ''tabescens'' is a heterothallic species of ''Armillaria.'' Heterothallic species perform anastomosis when haploid monokaryon come in contact with one another. Anastomosis is the connection or opening between two things, in this case the mycelium. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus that consists of hyphae. If the two monokaryons are sexually compatible they form a clamp connection. This results in a mycelium consisting of dikaryotic cells. The dikaryon cells predominate in the vegetative phase. In the basidia karyogamy occurs before meiosis and then the formation of basidiospores.<ref name=\":4\" />  The basidiospores then infect the host plant.\n\n''Armillaria'' ''tabescens'' is found to attack trees that are already stressed or have a wound. The pathogen can spread its mycelia and get into the trunk or root of a tree.<ref name=\":5\" /> The fungus has the ability to spread its mycelia throughout the root and trunk system and form mycelial mats. Mycelia is damaging to trees because they absorb the nutrients by secreting enzymes to breakdown the plant material. It specifically breaks down lignin because it is a white rot.\n[[File:2008-07-16 Armillaria tabescens cropped.jpg|thumb]]\nNo rhizomorphs have been found for ''Armillaria tabescens'' in nature. However, Rishbeth and Kile<ref name=\":4\" /> did find rhizomorphs buried in the soil on inocula. Since the species doesn't produce rhizomorphs commonly in the nature, infected roots must come into contact with other potential hosts for infection to occur. So, root grafting provides an effective pathway for the spread of this pathogen. Tsopelas<ref name=\":0\" /> conducted an experiment of inoculating almond trees with ''Armillaria tabescens'' and two other ''Armillaria'' species. The result of the experiment was that basidiocarps developed 6\u20138 weeks after the inoculation. The basidiocarps are recognized by not having an annulus around the stalk of the basidium. The basidiospores infect the trees. After two years, it only killed 3 out of the 16 trees and two other trees had symptoms of dieback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Edibility==\nThe species can be cooked and eaten, but has been reported to cause upset stomachs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |p=42}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Armillaria species|List of ''Armillaria'' species]]\n* [[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2449977}}\n\n[[Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Armillaria|tabescens]]\n[[Category:Bioluminescent fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1772]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| image = Armillaria tabescens.JPG\n| regnum = [[Fungi]]\n| divisio = [[Basidiomycota]]\n| classis = [[Agaricomycetes]]\n| ordo = [[Agaricales]]\n| familia = [[Physalacriaceae]]\n| genus = ''[[Armillaria]]''\n| species = '''''A. tabescens'''''\n| binomial = ''Armillaria tabescens''\n| binomial_authority = ([[Scop.]]) Emel (1921)\n| synonyms = \n''Agaricus gymnopodius'' <small>Bull.

Therefore, thinning of the crown would mean reduced branches and leaves. The trees eventually start yellowing and defoliating followed by fast wilting and dying of limbs.

Hyphae are branching structures that release enzymes to absorb nutrients from the host.\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\n''Armillaria'' ''tabescens'' is a heterothallic species of ''Armillaria.'' Heterothallic species perform anastomosis when haploid monokaryon come in contact with one another. Anastomosis is the connection or opening between two things, in this case the mycelium. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus that consists of hyphae. If the two monokaryons are sexually compatible they form a clamp connection. This results in a mycelium consisting of dikaryotic cells. The dikaryon cells predominate in the vegetative phase. In the basidia karyogamy occurs before meiosis and then the formation of basidiospores.<ref name=\":4\" />  The basidiospores then infect the host plant.\n\n''Armillaria'' ''tabescens'' is found to attack trees that are already stressed or have a wound. The pathogen can spread its mycelia and get into the trunk or root of a tree.<ref name=\":5\" /> The fungus has the ability to spread its mycelia throughout the root and trunk system and form mycelial mats. Mycelia is damaging to trees because they absorb the nutrients by secreting enzymes to breakdown the plant material. It specifically breaks down lignin because it is a white rot.\n[[File:2008-07-16 Armillaria tabescens cropped.jpg|thumb]]\nNo rhizomorphs have been found for ''Armillaria tabescens'' in nature. However, Rishbeth and Kile<ref name=\":4\" /> did find rhizomorphs buried in the soil on inocula. Since the species doesn't produce rhizomorphs commonly in the nature, infected roots must come into contact with other potential hosts for infection to occur. So, root grafting provides an effective pathway for the spread of this pathogen. Tsopelas<ref name=\":0\" /> conducted an experiment of inoculating almond trees with ''Armillaria tabescens'' and two other ''Armillaria'' species. The result of the experiment was that basidiocarps developed 6\u20138 weeks after the inoculation. The basidiocarps are recognized by not having an annulus around the stalk of the basidium. The basidiospores infect the trees. After two years, it only killed 3 out of the 16 trees and two other trees had symptoms of dieback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Edibility==\nThe species can be cooked and eaten, but has been reported to cause upset stomachs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |p=42}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Armillaria species|List of ''Armillaria'' species]]\n* [[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2449977}}\n\n[[Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Armillaria|tabescens]]\n[[Category:Bioluminescent fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1772]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Megatonnen", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria_tabescens"}

Doug and Delilah prepare a bus to transport them to the country while they go to work. However, Hunter takes over the bus and tries to capture the puppies. Dylan once again exploits his dog mannerisms and gets rid of him and rescues his siblings.

Doug and Delilah tell Dylan and Dolly about their family history with Cruella and how she plans to kill them and turn them into fur coats. Cruella and Hunter proceed to perform many tactics to weaken the dalmatians' defenses and starve them out. At Dylan's indirect suggestion, Diesel ends up digging a tunnel all the way to the park. However, the De Vils catch onto their scheme by accident and attack them from both fronts using Dizzy and Dee Dee's childlike innocence. The dalmatians escape to the park, only to be captured by Cruella's hired goons and entrapped in a shipping container to be flown away by helicopter. Doug and Delilah try to fend off Cruella who instead captures the two of them.<hr>Clarissa, witnessing the events, hops on behind Cruella's car. At the park, the Canal Crew hop onto the shipping container as it is being carried away. Dylan and Dolly manage to evade being captured and hop onto Pearl and proceed to chase the De Vils through the streets of London. Hunter realizes that Cruella plans to kill the puppies for their fur and is locked up with the rest of the dalmatians. Pearl tosses Dylan and Dolly onto the boat and together with the Canal Crew fight off Cruella and her goons to free their family before they are skinned in an elaborate machine. During this, Hunter finally stands up for himself and defeats Cruella by having her fall into the machine. The dalmatians pull her out just in time for the police to arrive after being notified by a citizen. As Cruella is taken away Hunter is forgiven and the dalmatians head home.<hr>'''Note'': This is a part of a one-hour special.

However, Dylan doesn't let her as it's not time to open gifts yet. It is at this moment that we can see Dolly in the background, eyeing the presents. Dylan puts on a \"hat\" (which appears to be a colander) and holds Dorothy's gift. Dorothy gets tired and goes off to bed. Dylan turns on the flashlight on his hat and holds a broom in an attempt to protect the presents. Dolly, Dizzy and Dee Dee try to sneak by and get their presents early, however. As Dolly eyes the presents she signals for Dizzy and Dee Dee to go. Dylan has stacked all of the presents on top of each other in order to get a better look at everything. He notices Dizzy and Dee Dee and sets up a system that will ring bells when Dizzy and Dee Dee touch a string. Dolly begins to run and manages to avoid them all, much to Dylan's shock. She ends up startled and it's revealed Dizzy and Dee Dee got tangled up! As Dylan runs off to reprimand them, Dolly uses the opportunity to snatch a gift. However, Dylan quickly notices and the two argue over a present. All their arguing shakes the tower so much that it falls and Dylan and Dolly get tangled up in the strings, too. One present remains on the ladder: Dorothy's. It falls and the four worry the ladder will fall and hit it. Luckily, it ends up not hitting it. Unfortunately, however, and random bolt of lightning comes and strikes it as the four look on, grimacing. However, when Dorothy wakes up the next day she's just happy to play with the string on top of the ashes that made up her present, and the 5 laugh as the short ends.\n| LineColor       = 9591B6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Muddy Pups\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|18}}{{efn|name=short1|This short was released to [[Disney Channel (Italy)|Disney Channel Italy]]'s YouTube channel on February 4, 2019.}}\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

However, Dylan doesn't let her as it's not time to open gifts yet. It is at this moment that we can see Dolly in the background, eyeing the presents. Dylan puts on a \"hat\" (which appears to be a colander) and holds Dorothy's gift. Dorothy gets tired and goes off to bed. Dylan turns on the flashlight on his hat and holds a broom in an attempt to protect the presents. Dolly, Dizzy and Dee Dee try to sneak by and get their presents early, however. As Dolly eyes the presents she signals for Dizzy and Dee Dee to go. Dylan has stacked all of the presents on top of each other in order to get a better look at everything. He notices Dizzy and Dee Dee and sets up a system that will ring bells when Dizzy and Dee Dee touch a string. Dolly begins to run and manages to avoid them all, much to Dylan's shock. She ends up startled and it's revealed Dizzy and Dee Dee got tangled up! As Dylan runs off to reprimand them, Dolly uses the opportunity to snatch a gift. However, Dylan quickly notices and the two argue over a present. All their arguing shakes the tower so much that it falls and Dylan and Dolly get tangled up in the strings, too. One present remains on the ladder: Dorothy's. It falls and the four worry the ladder will fall and hit it. Luckily, it ends up not hitting it. Unfortunately, however, and random bolt of lightning comes and strikes it as the four look on, grimacing. However, when Dorothy wakes up the next day she's just happy to play with the string on top of the ashes that made up her present, and the 5 laugh as the short ends.\n| LineColor       = 9591B6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Muddy Pups\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|18}}{{efn|name=short1|This short was released to [[Disney Channel (Italy)|Disney Channel Italy]]'s YouTube channel on February 4, 2019.}}\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.
