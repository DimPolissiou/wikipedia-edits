Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries. Some schools engage students in such projects as a means to reinforce lessons regarding immigration and history.<ref>{{cite news | first= | url=http://www.byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | title=Teacher's guide for PBS Ancestors series | publisher=BYU | date= | accessdate=2006-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006122948/http://byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | archive-date=2006-10-06 | url-status=live }}</ref> Other benefits include family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.\n\nThe terms \"genealogy\" and \"family history\" are often used synonymously, but some offer a slight difference in definition.

In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]].

More advanced features include the ability to restrict the information that is shared, usually by removing information about living people out of [[privacy]] concerns; the import of sound files; the generation of family history books, web pages and other publications; the ability to handle [[same-sex marriage]]s and children born out of wedlock; searching the Internet for data; and the provision of research guidance.  Programs may be geared toward a specific religion, with fields relevant to that religion, or to specific nationalities or ethnic groups, with source types relevant for those groups. Online resources involve complex programming and large data bases, such as censuses.<ref>Elizabeth Powell Crowe,  and William P. Mann.

Since genealogical records are often kept on paper and stacked in high-density storage, they are prone to fire, mold, insect damage, and eventual disintegration. Sometimes records of genealogical value are deliberately destroyed by governments or organizations because the records are considered to be unimportant or a privacy risk. Because of this, genealogists often organize efforts to preserve records that are at risk of destruction.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used.

Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems. Ethical standards adopted by various genealogical organizations include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |title=Genealogist's Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603030723/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics and Professional Practices |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Association of Professional Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030324/https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs /><ref name=sogstandards /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Australasian Federation of Family History Organisations |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030325/http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Respect copyright laws\n* Acknowledge where one consulted another's work and do not plagiarize the work of other researchers.\n* Treat original records with respect and avoid causing damage to them or removing them from repositories.\n* Treat archives and archive staff with respect.\n* Protect the privacy of living individuals by not publishing or otherwise disclosing information about them without their permission.\n* Disclose any conflicts of interest to clients.\n* When doing paid research, be clear with the client about scope of research and fees involved.\n* Do not fabricate information or publish false or unproven information as proven.\n* Be sensitive about information found through genealogical research that may make the client or family members uncomfortable.\nIn 2015, a committee presented standards for [[genetic genealogy]] at the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy. The standards emphasize that genealogists and testing companies should respect the privacy of clients and recognize the limits of DNA tests. It also discusses how genealogists should thoroughly document conclusions made using DNA evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com |title=The Genetic Genealogy Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Genetic Genealogy Standartds |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724004323/https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com/ |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}[/]</ref> In 2019, the Board for the Certification of Genealogists officially updated their standards and code of ethics to include standards for genetic genealogy.<ref name=bcgstandards />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{collist|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[Cluster genealogy]]\n* [[Descent from antiquity]]\n* [[Family tree]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genealogical numbering systems]]\n* [[International Museum for Family History]]\n* [[Genealogy software]]\n* [[Genealogy tourism]]\n* [[List of genealogy databases]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Forensic genealogy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''General'''\n* {{cite book |last=Christian |first=Peter |title=The Genealogist's Internet |edition=5th |location=London, England |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4081-5957-6 }}\n* Hopwood, Nick, Rebecca Flemming, Lauren Kassell, eds.

Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).</ref> To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]].

[[Social networking service]] (SNS) websites allow genealogists to share data and build their family trees online. Members can upload their family trees and contact other family historians to fill in gaps in their research.

These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used. In order to protect the patronymics system, in Iceland it is forbidden by law to introduce a new surname.{{cite web | title=L\u00f6g um Mannan\u00f6fn | url=http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | language=Icelandic | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126040640/http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | archive-date=2009-01-26 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Denmark and Norway patronymics and farm names were generally in use through the 19th century and beyond, though surnames began to come into fashion toward the end of the 19th century in some parts of the country. Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems.

It lies {{Convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the capital [[Kathmandu]], attached in the north to [[Raxaul]] in the border of the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgibirgunj.org/page/detail/1|title=ABOUT BIRGUNJ|website=www.cgibirgunj.org|access-date=2017-07-04}}</ref> As an entry point to Nepal from [[Patna]] and [[Kolkata]], it is known as the \"Gateway to Nepal\". The town has significant economic importance for Nepal as most of the trade with India is via Birgunj and the Indian town of [[Raxaul]]. [[Tribhuvan Highway]] links Birgunj to Nepal's capital, [[Kathmandu]]. Birganj was one of the first three municipalities formed during the rule of Prime Minister [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] It was declared a [[Metropolitan City]] on 22 May 2017 along with [[Biratnagar]] and [[Pokhara]]. Birgunj is currently the second largest city in the [[Terai]] region of Nepal after Biratnagar and Birgunj is the sixth most populated [[metropolis]] of the nation.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nBirgunj was established as a conglomerate of several villages in and around Gahawa Mai Temple. Gahawa Mai Temple remains the epicenter of the town. The settlement was named after the Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Bir Shamsher]], thus acquiring the name Birgunj.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient===\n{{Citations missing|section|date=April 2020}}\nBefore the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was [[Alau, Nepal]].In July 1959 From Sugauli King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.\n\n[[File:\u0917\u0939\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0948 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Gahawa Mai Mandir/Maisthan Mandir]]\n\nBirgunj was founded in 1897 by 11th Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]; the ancient name was Gahawa. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages Baghi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Prasauni, Inaruwa, Chhapkaiya were existed.To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.\n\n[[File:Palace of Birgunj, Nepal.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Birgunj, Nepal Built By Bir Shamshar Rana]]\n\nAfter the dealth of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, [[Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] became Prime Minister, but within three months [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately.After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment,the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of dealth sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.\n\nChandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birganj Bazar, which his brother had established.He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat.According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market).The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.\n\n===Modern===\nOn 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state. This led to unrest by Hindu fundamentalist groups across Nepal; the town of Birgunj was forced to close for nearly two years and was disturbed for more than 10 years .<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p04s01-wosc.html Nepal's Hindu majority is denouncing the recent move to end Nepal's longtime status as the world's only Hindu state].

In addition to Bhojpuri, several other languages are spoken, including [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Hindi]], [[English language|English]] and [[Newari language|Newari]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:BirgunjMainRoad.jpg|thumb|Alakhiya Math, Birgunj in 1970 \nFile:Ghantaghar from the west.jpg|thumb|Ghantaghar, Birgunj in 2019\n</gallery>\n\n==Topography, geology and soils ==\n\nBirgunj is located in the Terai plain which is the northern part of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Birgunj metropolitan city has elongated shape. The variation in altitude is in the range of 78 m to 95 m when moving from south to north of Birgunj. Although the range of altitude variation is small, but there is a high micro-topographical variation.City lies on 90m above sea level.Quaternary sediments are mainly found in the area. Soil is very fertile that consists the mixture of clay, silt and sand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/75216/36188-01-nep-tacr-18.pdf|title=Birgunj Initial Environmental Assessment}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nThe climatic condition is sub-tropical monsoon with very hot and wet summer. The mean annual temperature ranges from {{cvt|23.8 to 24.5|\u00b0C}}. The annual rainfall ranges from about {{cvt|1300 to 2800|mm}} with an average of {{cvt|1800|mm}}.

Both rivers flows from north to south. During monsoon, these rivers are flooded  and river bank cutting at the bends is common. The water level is very low in these rivers during winter. The depth of Groundwater table is approximately between {{cvt|9\u201315|m}} deep with {{cvt|1\u20132|m}} fluctuation during wet and dry season.<ref>Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Climatological Records (various volumes and years)</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[File:King Mahendra.jpg|thumb|left|Late King Mahendra at the inauguration of Birgunj Sugar Mill in 1965.]]\n\nHistory wrote in 1964 when Birgunj Sugar Factory Ltd. was established by the Government of Nepal in collaboration with the Soviet Union(At present,Russia) with initial crushing capacity of 1,000 metric tons which later increased to 1,500 metric tons (Rajak, 2006). This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy losses.\n\nBirgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this route. The Indian border town of [[Raxaul]] has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade volume.With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, plastic, cigarettes, aluminium, among others. Almost 56% of the total products of Birgunj are exported to the [[Indian state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>CPS, NEPAL 2013, Annual UN Report Bureau.</ref>\n\nBirgunj Customs holds a major contribution in terms of revenue earnings in the nation.On 16 July 2004 [[Birganj Inland Dry Port ]] came in operation to improve trade operation and address the concerns in handling the large volume of goods.\n\nThe India-Nepal oil pipeline construction that began on March 9, 2018 saw its completion up to 13 km.The 69-km Amlekhgunj-Raxaul oil pipeline connecting the two countries has been laid along the Pathlaiya-Simara-Jitpur, Parwanipur and Birgunj bypass roadway.

Vishwa Buddha Vihar, located in the out-skirts of the city. Vishwa is actually shaped like a stupa and has engravings of Lord Buddha facing the cardinal directions of the universe. This place has a tranquil ambiance and it attracts those tourists who want to flee the bustling life of the city. The term vishwa is derived from the word vicchu-wa, which is translated as a resting place for vicchu(s) or Buddhist monks and means a resting place. In the ancient times, the pilgrims stopped at Birgunj in the midst of their journey between Lumbini and Bodh Gaya (India).The mound is protected by a boundary wall, and future excavations may well tell us about the history of not just Birgunj but also its importance to Buddhism 2,500 years ago.\n\n[[File:Parsa-national-park-975x540.jpg|thumb|Signboard of Parsa National Park and a statue of an elephant at the side of entrance gate.]]\n\n[[Parsa National Park]] which is {{cvt|33|km}} from the city, known for inhabiting Royal Bengal Tigers ([[Panthera tigris tigris]]),Asian elephants ([[Elephas maximus]]),One-horned Rhinoceros ([[Rhinoceros unicornis]]),Common Leopard ([[Panthera pardus]]) and also various species of mammals,birds and reptiles.The park can visited by one hour drive by bus from the city.<ref name=\"Government of Nepal\">{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Parsa National Park |title=Parsa National Park |url=http://parsanationalpark.gov.np |website=Parsa National Park |publisher=Government of Nepal}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" >\nFile:Birgunj Railway.jpg|thumb|Birgunj Railway in 1974\nFile:Nepal Goverment Railway,Birgunj.jpg|thumb|Nepal Government Rail,Birgunj in 1968\n</gallery>\n\nBirgunj was built as the closest Nepalese city connecting the capital Kathmandu with India. Birgunj railway station was connected by the [[Nepal Government Railway (NGR)]] to Raxaul station in Bihar across the border with India. The {{Convert|47|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway extended north to [[Amlekhganj]] in Nepal. It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond Birgunj in December 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|title=Transport in Nepal|publisher=nepal.saarctourism.org|access-date=2008-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229011939/http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|archive-date=2008-12-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nTrains run to major cities of India from Raxaul station (in India, adjacent to Birgunj) and Sugauli station (17 miles from Raxaul) including the [[Satyagrah Express]] to [[Delhi]], [[Mithila Express]] to [[Kolkata]], Lokmanya Tilak express to [[Mumbai]], and HYD-RXL express to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Thus, Birgunj has direct connectivity to major Indian cities like - Patna, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Amritsar, Guwahati, Bhopal, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Ranchi, Raipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, etc.\n\n===Air===\nBirgunj is served by [[Simara Airport]], which lies 9 miles North of the city. Regular flights operate between Kathmandu & Simara. The second International Airport of Nepal is under construction at Nijgadh (22 miles from Birganj). There are plans to connect the new airport, Birgunj and Kathmandu via a \"Fasttrack\" expressway after its completion. This is expected to reduce travel times between the capital and the commercial capital, Birgunj\n\n===Buses===\nThere are regular bus services to all major cities and towns in Nepal including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Patan, Bhaktapur, Biratnagar, Dharan, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Kakarvitta, Janakpur, Bhairahawa(Lumbini), Bharatpur(Chitwan), etc.\nLocal bus services provide transportation inside the city and into its vicinity. Night buses from Birgunj to Kathmandu are the most luxurious bus services in all over Nepal. Birgunj bus park is the centre to find buses for any route,\n\n===Tanga===\nHorse driven carts locally called Tanga have historically been the mode of transport for the Madheshi people. Today it survives as a popular transportation vehicle between Birgunj and its sister city Raxaul.\n\n===Cargo===\nThe {{Convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway track from Raxaul to Birgunj was converted to [[broad gauge]] two years after the Indian railways converted the track to Raxaul inside India to broad gauge. Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.\n\nGoods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal. This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, [[Hetauda]]. It is also served by [[Tribhuvan Highway]], extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to Kathmandu with frequent bus service. [[Simara Airport]] \u2014 {{Convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on}} north near the highway in [[Pipara Simara]], [[Bara district]] \u2014 offers scheduled flights to Kathmandu.\n\nIndia and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on the movement of their citizens. There is a [[Geography of Nepal#Border crossing|customs checkpoint]] for the movement of goods and third country nationals.{{Clarify|date=August 2014|reason=How do they prove they are from Nepal or India without a passport?}}\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[File:Narayani Rangasala.jpg|thumb|Narayani Rangasala]]\nThe city has its own stadium, [[Narayani Stadium]] which is Nepal's second largest stadium after Dasarath Rangasala built on 2038 B.S.. The stadium has capacity of 15,000 seats.At Present,the stadium is in poor condition.\n\nA national level [[Cricket]] Ground is also located beside the Narayani Stadium. The cricket ground has top class outfield and a better [[cricket pitch]]. National level and Regional level cricket tournament are regularly held here. Every year day night [[T20 Cricket]] tournament is held using temporary flood light towers. Day night cricket match in Nepal was first played here.\n\nThe city is known as the cricket hub of Nepal and has Adarsh Nagar Stadium. [[Nepal national cricket team]]'s players [[Haseem Ansari]], [[Aarif Sheikh]], [[Avinash Karn]] and [[Irshad Ahmed]] hail from Birgunj.

The town has significant economic importance for Nepal as most of the trade with India is via Birgunj and the Indian town of [[Raxaul]]. [[Tribhuvan Highway]] links Birgunj to Nepal's capital, [[Kathmandu]]. Birganj was one of the first three municipalities formed during the rule of Prime Minister [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] It was declared a [[Metropolitan City]] on 22 May 2017 along with [[Biratnagar]] and [[Pokhara]]. Birgunj is currently the second largest city in the [[Terai]] region of Nepal after Biratnagar and Birgunj is the sixth most populated [[metropolis]] of the nation.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nBirgunj was established as a conglomerate of several villages in and around Gahawa Mai Temple. Gahawa Mai Temple remains the epicenter of the town. The settlement was named after the Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Bir Shamsher]], thus acquiring the name Birgunj.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient===\n{{Citations missing|section|date=April 2020}}\nBefore the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was [[Alau]].In July 1959 From Sugauli King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.\n\n[[File:\u0917\u0939\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0948 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Gahawa Mai Mandir/Maisthan Mandir]]\n\nBirgunj was founded in 1897 by 11th Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]; the ancient name was Gahawa. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages Baghi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Prasauni, Inaruwa, Chhapkaiya were existed.To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.\n\n[[File:Palace of Birgunj, Nepal.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Birgunj, Nepal Built By Bir Shamshar Rana]]\n\nAfter the dealth of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, [[Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] became Prime Minister, but within three months [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately.After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment,the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of dealth sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.\n\nChandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birganj Bazar, which his brother had established.He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat.According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market).The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.\n\n===Modern===\nOn 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state. This led to unrest by Hindu fundamentalist groups across Nepal; the town of Birgunj was forced to close for nearly two years and was disturbed for more than 10 years .<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p04s01-wosc.html Nepal's Hindu majority is denouncing the recent move to end Nepal's longtime status as the world's only Hindu state].

He also served as Boston's interim manager for the final seven weeks of the 2015 season when his boss, [[John Farrell (manager)|John Farrell]], stepped aside for successful treatment for [[lymphoma]]. Lovullo compiled a [[win-loss record]] of 28\u201320 (.583) from August 14, 2015, through the final day of the season, October 4.<ref name=\"low1\"/> His earlier [[manager (baseball)|managing]] career included service in the [[Cleveland Indians]]' and Red Sox' [[farm system]]s (2002\u201310).\n\nLovullo is from [[Santa Monica, California]], and attended [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n\nAn [[infielder]] in his playing days, he was listed at {{convert|6|ft|1|in}} tall and {{convert|185|lb}} and was a [[switch hitter]] who threw right-handed. He was drafted by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the fifth round of the [[1987 Major League Baseball draft]] and made his Major League debut with the Tigers on September 10, 1988. He also played in the Majors for the [[New York Yankees]], [[California Angels]], [[Seattle Mariners]], [[Oakland Athletics]] and the Indians, and appeared in his final big-league game on October 3, 1999, for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  After his MLB career ended, Lovullo spent one season in Japan as a member of the [[Yakult Swallows]] in 2000.\n\nLovullo first reached the Major Leagues for a brief trial in September 1988, his second professional season. Replacing [[Tom Brookens]] at third base in the late innings of a 9\u20134 Tiger loss to the Yankees at [[Yankee Stadium I|Yankee Stadium]] on September 10, he handled no [[chance (baseball)|chances]] in the field, but [[single (baseball)|singled]] off [[Rick Rhoden]] in his first big-league [[at bat]].  Lovullo would play one full season and parts of seven others in the Majors.  In his only full campaign, 1993 with the Angels, he appeared in 116 [[games played]], and collected 92 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] a career-high .251.

He then moved up to the High Class A [[Kinston Indians]] (2003\u201304) and the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Akron Aeros]] (2005), which he piloted to an 84\u201358 [[win-loss record]] and the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] championship. His 2005 success led to his first MLB managerial audition, when he was invited to interview for the vacant managerial job for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] prior to the 2006 season.  When the Dodgers settled on [[Grady Little]] for their manager position, Lovullo resumed managing in the Indians' organization as skipper of the Buffalo Bisons, the Tribe's Triple-A affiliate.\n\nDuring Lovullo's playing career, he had spent all or parts of three seasons (1995; 1997\u201398) as a player for the Bisons and won two championships: one in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and one in the [[International League]]. In 2003, he also had received the highest honor awarded to an alumnus of Buffalo baseball, as he was inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame, alongside his teammate from the 1997 and 1998 championship squads, [[Jeff Manto]].  In three campaigns (2006\u201308) as the Bisons' manager, he led the club to two winning records, and compiled a mark of 214\u2013212. He also interviewed for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' managerial vacancy after the 2007 season.\n\nIn 2009, the Indians changed their Triple-A affiliation from Buffalo to the Columbus (Ohio) Clippers of the International League.  Lovullo had played for the Clippers in 1991\u201392 when the team was the Yankees' top farm club. The Clippers were the International League champions in both seasons Lovullo played in Columbus, winning back-to-back [[Governors' Cup]] trophies.  In 2009, his only season as the Clippers' manager, the team compiled a 57\u201385 (.401) record, but Lovullo was recruited by the Boston Red Sox to take over their Triple-A team, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], for 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2009/11/torey_lovullo_leaves_cleveland.html |title=Torey Lovullo leaves Cleveland Indians; Joel Skinner, Mike Sarbaugh could replace him at Columbus |publisher=cleveland.com |date=November 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> It was his first season in the Boston organization, although both Farrell (as pitching coach) and another former Cleveland [[farm system]] official, [[Mike Hazen]] (as director of player development), were playing key roles with the Red Sox.

[[professional baseball]] [[manager (baseball)|manager]] for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), appointed November 4, 2016.\n\nLovullo served as the [[coach (baseball)|first base coach]] for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] from {{mlby|2011}} to {{mlby|2012}}, then as the [[coach (baseball)|bench coach]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] from {{mlby|2013}} until {{mlby|2016}}. He also served as Boston's interim manager for the final seven weeks of the 2015 season when his boss, [[John Farrell (manager)|John Farrell]], stepped aside for successful treatment for [[lymphoma]]. Lovullo compiled a [[win-loss record]] of 28\u201320 (.583) from August 14, 2015, through the final day of the season, October 4.<ref name=\"low1\"/> His earlier [[manager (baseball)|managing]] career included service in the [[Cleveland Indians]]' and Red Sox' [[farm system]]s (2002\u201310).\n\nLovullo is from [[Santa Monica, California]], and attended [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n\nAn [[infielder]] in his playing days, he was listed at {{convert|6|ft|1|in}} tall and {{convert|185|lb}} and was a [[switch hitter]] who threw right-handed. He was drafted by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the fifth round of the [[1987 Major League Baseball draft]] and made his Major League debut with the Tigers on September 10, 1988. He also played in the Majors for the [[New York Yankees]], [[California Angels]], [[Seattle Mariners]], [[Oakland Athletics]] and the Indians, and appeared in his final big-league game on October 3, 1999, for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  After his MLB career ended, Lovullo spent one season in Japan as a member of the [[Yakult Swallows]] in 2000.\n\nLovullo first reached the Major Leagues for a brief trial in September 1988, his second professional season. Replacing [[Tom Brookens]] at third base in the late innings of a 9\u20134 Tiger loss to the Yankees at [[Yankee Stadium I|Yankee Stadium]] on September 10, he handled no [[chance (baseball)|chances]] in the field, but [[single (baseball)|singled]] off [[Rick Rhoden]] in his first big-league [[at bat]].  Lovullo would play one full season and parts of seven others in the Majors.  In his only full campaign, 1993 with the Angels, he appeared in 116 [[games played]], and collected 92 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] a career-high .251.  He was the Angels' most-used [[second baseman]], starting in 79 of the team's 162 games.  He was a teammate that season of [[pitcher]] [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]], and formed an association that would influence Lovullo's managerial and coaching career.\n\nAltogether, Lovullo appeared in 303 MLB games, including 133 at second base, and 67 each at [[first baseman|first base]] and [[third baseman|third base]].  He batted .224 in 737 at bats, collecting 165 total hits, including 15 [[home runs]], 60 [[runs batted in]], 35 [[double (baseball)|doubles]] and one [[triple (baseball)|triple]]. In Japan in 1999 he played in only 29 games and batted .197 with one home run and two runs batted in.\n\nLovullo's long minor league playing career \u20141,433 games with 1,193 hits, and a batting average of .267<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=lovull001sal |title=Minor league statistics from |publisher=[[Baseball Reference]] |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> \u2014 included extended stays with the [[Toledo Mud Hens]], [[Columbus Clippers]] and [[Buffalo Bisons]]; he would later return to manage in both Buffalo and Columbus.\n\n==Coaching and managing career==\n===Minor league manager===\nLovullo's off-field career began in the Cleveland organization in 2001 as a [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] infield coach.<ref name=\"bwl\">''Boston Red Sox 2013 Media Guide'', page 60</ref> After Farrell joined the Indians' front office as director of player development that November, Lovullo became the manager of the 2002 [[Columbus RedStixx|Columbus (Georgia) RedStixx]] of the Class A [[South Atlantic League]], and guided them to the finals of the SAL playoffs.  He then moved up to the High Class A [[Kinston Indians]] (2003\u201304) and the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Akron Aeros]] (2005), which he piloted to an 84\u201358 [[win-loss record]] and the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] championship. His 2005 success led to his first MLB managerial audition, when he was invited to interview for the vacant managerial job for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] prior to the 2006 season.  When the Dodgers settled on [[Grady Little]] for their manager position, Lovullo resumed managing in the Indians' organization as skipper of the Buffalo Bisons, the Tribe's Triple-A affiliate.\n\nDuring Lovullo's playing career, he had spent all or parts of three seasons (1995; 1997\u201398) as a player for the Bisons and won two championships: one in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and one in the [[International League]]. In 2003, he also had received the highest honor awarded to an alumnus of Buffalo baseball, as he was inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame, alongside his teammate from the 1997 and 1998 championship squads, [[Jeff Manto]].  In three campaigns (2006\u201308) as the Bisons' manager, he led the club to two winning records, and compiled a mark of 214\u2013212. He also interviewed for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' managerial vacancy after the 2007 season.\n\nIn 2009, the Indians changed their Triple-A affiliation from Buffalo to the Columbus (Ohio) Clippers of the International League.  Lovullo had played for the Clippers in 1991\u201392 when the team was the Yankees' top farm club. The Clippers were the International League champions in both seasons Lovullo played in Columbus, winning back-to-back [[Governors' Cup]] trophies.  In 2009, his only season as the Clippers' manager, the team compiled a 57\u201385 (.401) record, but Lovullo was recruited by the Boston Red Sox to take over their Triple-A team, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], for 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2009/11/torey_lovullo_leaves_cleveland.html |title=Torey Lovullo leaves Cleveland Indians; Joel Skinner, Mike Sarbaugh could replace him at Columbus |publisher=cleveland.com |date=November 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> It was his first season in the Boston organization, although both Farrell (as pitching coach) and another former Cleveland [[farm system]] official, [[Mike Hazen]] (as director of player development), were playing key roles with the Red Sox.  Lovullo's 2010 PawSox finished 66\u201378 (.458) and out of the playoffs, fourth in the Northern Division of the International League.\n\nDuring his minor league managing career, Lovullo was named \"Manager of the Year\" in both the [[Carolina League]] (2004) and the Eastern League (2005). For the latter season, he also was named Double-A Manager of the Year by [[Baseball America]].<ref name=\"bwl\"/> His nine-year (2002\u201310) [[win-loss record]] as a minor league manager is 661\u2013609 (.520).\n\n===Major league coach===\n[[File:Torey Lovullo 2012.jpg|thumb|Torey Lovullo 2012]]\n \nAt the close of the 2010 season, Farrell, then considered a top Major League managerial candidate, was hired as the manager of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for 2011.  He named Lovullo to his Toronto coaching staff on November 8, 2010, to replace [[Omar Malav\u00e9]] as the club's first-base coach,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=tor&coachorstaffid=117950 |title=Manager and Coaches &#124; bluejays.com: Team |publisher=Toronto.bluejays.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> and he served two seasons in that capacity.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, the Red Sox began negotiations with the Blue Jays to release Farrell from his contract so that he could return to Boston as manager for 2013.  Ultimately, the Red Sox acquired the rights to Farrell in an October 21 trade for [[infielder]] [[Mike Avil\u00e9s]].  Upon being named the Red Sox' manager, Farrell hired Lovullo on October 26, 2012, as his bench coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2012/10/26/lovullo_leaves_blue_jays_for_farrell/ |title=Sportsnet.ca |publisher=Sportsnet.ca |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> After the Red Sox won the [[2013 World Series]], Lovullo was mentioned as a potential candidate to succeed [[Dale Sveum]] as manager of the [[Chicago Cubs]] for 2014,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/23483095-573/four-names-appear-to-be-in-the-running-for-cubs-managerial-job.html |title=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=Suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> but he returned as Boston's bench coach.<ref>{{cite news|last=Forde |first=Craig |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2013/11/disarcina_leaves_red_sox_for_angels.html |title=boston.com |publisher=boston.com |date=November 5, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref>  Then, upon the close of the 2014 season, Lovullo interviewed for managerial openings with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/11661783/texas-rangers-meet-boston-red-sox-bench-coach-torey-lovullo-manager-job|title=Rangers meet with Lovullo about manager's job|publisher=|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> and [[Minnesota Twins]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2014/10/26/twins-red-sox-bench-coach-torey-lovullo-gets-second-interview/|title=Twins: Red Sox bench coach Torey Lovullo gets second interview \u2013 Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> but was a runner-up in each case.  \n\n===Interim manager===\nOn August 11, 2015, Farrell underwent hernia surgery, leaving Lovullo in charge of the team.

It lay in the [[Nile Delta]] near what is known today as [[Zagazig]].<ref name=\"Velde164\"/><ref name=\"emuseum\">[http://www.egyptianmuseum.gov.eg/bastet.html Bastet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703204648/http://www.egyptianmuseum.gov.eg/bastet.html |date=July 3, 2008 }} Egyptian Museum</ref> The town, known in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''pr-b\ua723stt'' (also transliterated as ''Per-Bastet''), carries her name, literally meaning ''House of Bastet''. It was known in Greek as ''Boubastis'' (''\u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2'') and translated into Hebrew as ''P\u00ee-beset'', spelled without the initial ''t'' sound of the last syllable.<ref name=Velde165 /> In the biblical [[Book of Ezekiel]] 30:17, the town appears in the Hebrew form ''Pibeseth''.<ref name=Velde164 />\n\n===Temple===\n[[File:Lioness Bast cosmetic jar 83d40m tut burial artifact.jpg|thumb|An Eighteenth Dynasty burial artifact from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ({{circa|1323 BC}}), an [[alabaster]] cosmetic jar topped with a lioness representing Bastet \u2014 ''Cairo Museum'']]\n[[Herodotus]], an ancient Greek historian who traveled in Egypt in the fifth century BCE, describes Bastet's [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at some length:<ref name=Herodotus138>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 138.</ref>\n{{quotation|1= Save for the entrance, it stands on an island; two separate channels approach it from the Nile, and after coming up to the entry of the temple, they run round it on opposite sides; each of them a hundred feet wide, and overshadowed by trees. The temple is in the midst of the city, the whole circuit of which commands a view down into it; for the city's level has been raised, but that of the temple has been left as it was from the first, so that it can be seen into from without. A stone wall, carven with figures, runs round it; within is a grove of very tall trees growing round a great shrine, wherein is the image of the goddess; the temple is a square, each side measuring a [[furlong]]. A road, paved with stone, of about three furlongs' length leads to the entrance, running eastward through the market place, towards the temple of [[Hermes]]; this road is about 400 feet wide, and bordered by trees reaching to heaven.}}\n\nThis description by Herodotus and several Egyptian texts suggest that water surrounded the temple on three (out of four) sides, forming a type of lake known as, ''isheru'', not too dissimilar from that surrounding the temple of the mother goddess [[Mut]] in [[Karnak]] at Thebes.<ref name=Velde164 /> These lakes were typical components of temples devoted to a number of lioness goddesses, who are said to represent one original goddess, Bastet, Mut, [[Tefnut]], [[Hathor]], and Sakhmet,<ref name=Velde164 /> and came to be associated with sun gods such as Horus and Ra as well as the [[Eye of Ra]]. Each of them had to be appeased by a specific set of rituals.<ref name=Velde164 /> One myth relates that a lioness, fiery and wrathful, was once cooled down by the water of the lake, transformed into a gentle cat, and settled in the temple.<ref name=Velde164 />\n\nAt the Bubastis temple, some cats were found to have been [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried, many next to their owners. More than 300,000 mummified cats were discovered when Bastet's temple was [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]]. Turner and Bateson suggest that the status of the cat was roughly equivalent to that of the cow in modern India. The death of a cat might leave a family in great mourning and those who could, would have them embalmed or buried in cat cemeteries\u2014pointing to the great prevalence of the cult of Bastet. Extensive burials of cat remains were found not only at Bubastis, but also at [[Beni Hasan]] and [[Saqqara]]. In 1888, a farmer uncovered a burial site of many hundreds of thousands of cats in Beni Hasan.<ref name=Serpell184 />\n\n===Festival===\nHerodotus also relates that of the many solemn festivals held in Egypt, the most important and most popular one was that celebrated in Bubastis in honor of this goddess.<ref name=Herodotus59>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 59.</ref><ref name=Herodotus137>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 137.</ref> Each year on the day of her festival, the town was said to have attracted some 700,000 visitors, both men and women (but not children), who arrived in numerous crowded ships. The women engaged in music, song, and dance on their way to the place. Great sacrifices were made and prodigious amounts of wine were drunk\u2014more than was the case throughout the year.<ref name=Herodotus60>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 60.</ref> This accords well with Egyptian sources that prescribe that lioness goddesses are to be appeased with the \"feasts of drunkenness\".<ref name=Velde165 /> A festival of Bastet was known to be celebrated during the New Kingdom at Bubastis. The block statue from the eighteenth dynasty ({{circa|1380 BC}}) of Nefer-ka, the wab-priest of Sekhmet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://project-min.de/home/english/restoration.html|title=restoration|website=project-min.de|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> provides written evidence for this. The inscription suggests that the king, [[Amenhotep III]], was present at the event and had great offerings made to the deity.\n\n==History==\nBastet first appears in the third millennium BC, where she is depicted as either a fierce lioness or a woman with the head of a lioness.<ref name=Velde164>Te Velde, \"Bastet\", p. 164.</ref> Two thousand years later, during the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 1070\u2013712 BC), Bastet began to be depicted as a domestic cat or a cat-headed woman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Art of Ancient Egypt: Revised Edition|last=Robins|first=Gay|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-674-03065-7|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=197}}</ref>\n\nScribes of the New Kingdom and later eras began referring to her with an additional [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] [[Affix|suffix]], as ''Bastet''. The name change is thought to have been added to emphasize pronunciation of the ending ''t'' sound, often left silent.\n\n[[Cats in ancient Egypt]] were highly revered, partly due to their ability to combat [[vermin]] such as mice, rats (which threatened key food supplies), and snakes\u2014especially [[cobra]]s. Cats of royalty were, in some instances, known to be dressed in golden jewelry and were allowed to eat from the plates of their owners. Turner and Bateson estimate that during the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] ({{circa|945\u2013715 BC}}), Bastet worship changed from being a lioness deity into being predominantly a major cat deity.<ref name=\"Serpell184\"/> Because domestic cats tend to be tender and protective of their offspring, Bastet was also regarded as a good mother and sometimes was depicted with numerous [[kitten]]s. \n\nThe native Egyptian rulers were replaced by Greeks during an occupation of Ancient Egypt in the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]] that lasted almost 300 years. The Greeks sometimes equated Bastet with one of their goddesses, [[Artemis]].<ref name=\"Delia 545\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture#Bastet}}\n\nBastet was portrayed as the panther goddess Bast and worshipped by the Golden Tribe in the Marvel Cinematic Universe release Black Panther.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cats in ancient Egypt]]\n*[[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Herodotus]], ed.

This association would have come about much later than when the goddess was a protective lioness goddess, however, and is useful only in deciphering the origin of the term, alabaster.\n\n==Role in ancient Egypt==\n{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}\nBastet was originally a fierce lioness warrior goddess of the [[solar deity|sun]] worshiped throughout most of ancient Egyptian history, but later she was changed into the cat goddess that is familiar today, becoming Bastet.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt|last=Pinch|first=Geraldine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=115}}</ref> She then was depicted as the daughter of [[Ra]] and [[Isis]], and the consort of [[Ptah]], with whom she had a son [[Maahes]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAs protector of [[Lower Egypt]], she was seen as defender of the [[pharaoh|king]], and consequently of the sun god, [[Ra]].

The goddess was sometimes depicted holding a ceremonial [[sistrum]] in one hand and an [[aegis]] in the other\u2014the aegis usually resembling a collar or [[gorget]], embellished with a lioness head.\n\nBastet was also depicted as the goddess of protection against contagious diseases and evil spirits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Bastet/|title=Bastet|last=Mark|first=Joshua J.|date=July 24, 2016|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113171025/https://www.ancient.eu/Bastet/|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=|access-date=December 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Bubastis==\n{{main|Bubastis}}\nBastet was a local deity whose religious sect was centered in the city that became named, Bubastis. It lay in the [[Nile Delta]] near what is known today as [[Zagazig]].<ref name=\"Velde164\"/><ref name=\"emuseum\">[http://www.egyptianmuseum.gov.eg/bastet.html Bastet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703204648/http://www.egyptianmuseum.gov.eg/bastet.html |date=July 3, 2008 }} Egyptian Museum</ref> The town, known in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''pr-b\ua723stt'' (also transliterated as ''Per-Bastet''), carries her name, literally meaning ''House of Bastet''. It was known in Greek as ''Boubastis'' (''\u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2'') and translated into Hebrew as ''P\u00ee-beset'', spelled without the initial ''t'' sound of the last syllable.<ref name=Velde165 /> In the biblical [[Book of Ezekiel]] 30:17, the town appears in the Hebrew form ''Pibeseth''.<ref name=Velde164 />\n\n===Temple===\n[[File:Lioness Bast cosmetic jar 83d40m tut burial artifact.jpg|thumb|An Eighteenth Dynasty burial artifact from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ({{circa|1323 BC}}), an [[alabaster]] cosmetic jar topped with a lioness representing Bastet \u2014 ''Cairo Museum'']]\n[[Herodotus]], an ancient Greek historian who traveled in Egypt in the fifth century BCE, describes Bastet's [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at some length:<ref name=Herodotus138>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 138.</ref>\n{{quotation|1= Save for the entrance, it stands on an island; two separate channels approach it from the Nile, and after coming up to the entry of the temple, they run round it on opposite sides; each of them a hundred feet wide, and overshadowed by trees. The temple is in the midst of the city, the whole circuit of which commands a view down into it; for the city's level has been raised, but that of the temple has been left as it was from the first, so that it can be seen into from without. A stone wall, carven with figures, runs round it; within is a grove of very tall trees growing round a great shrine, wherein is the image of the goddess; the temple is a square, each side measuring a [[furlong]]. A road, paved with stone, of about three furlongs' length leads to the entrance, running eastward through the market place, towards the temple of [[Hermes]]; this road is about 400 feet wide, and bordered by trees reaching to heaven.}}\n\nThis description by Herodotus and several Egyptian texts suggest that water surrounded the temple on three (out of four) sides, forming a type of lake known as, ''isheru'', not too dissimilar from that surrounding the temple of the mother goddess [[Mut]] in [[Karnak]] at Thebes.<ref name=Velde164 /> These lakes were typical components of temples devoted to a number of lioness goddesses, who are said to represent one original goddess, Bastet, Mut, [[Tefnut]], [[Hathor]], and Sakhmet,<ref name=Velde164 /> and came to be associated with sun gods such as Horus and Ra as well as the [[Eye of Ra]]. Each of them had to be appeased by a specific set of rituals.<ref name=Velde164 /> One myth relates that a lioness, fiery and wrathful, was once cooled down by the water of the lake, transformed into a gentle cat, and settled in the temple.<ref name=Velde164 />\n\nAt the Bubastis temple, some cats were found to have been [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried, many next to their owners. More than 300,000 mummified cats were discovered when Bastet's temple was [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]]. Turner and Bateson suggest that the status of the cat was roughly equivalent to that of the cow in modern India. The death of a cat might leave a family in great mourning and those who could, would have them embalmed or buried in cat cemeteries\u2014pointing to the great prevalence of the cult of Bastet. Extensive burials of cat remains were found not only at Bubastis, but also at [[Beni Hasan]] and [[Saqqara]]. In 1888, a farmer uncovered a burial site of many hundreds of thousands of cats in Beni Hasan.<ref name=Serpell184 />\n\n===Festival===\nHerodotus also relates that of the many solemn festivals held in Egypt, the most important and most popular one was that celebrated in Bubastis in honor of this goddess.<ref name=Herodotus59>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 59.</ref><ref name=Herodotus137>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 137.</ref> Each year on the day of her festival, the town was said to have attracted some 700,000 visitors, both men and women (but not children), who arrived in numerous crowded ships. The women engaged in music, song, and dance on their way to the place. Great sacrifices were made and prodigious amounts of wine were drunk\u2014more than was the case throughout the year.<ref name=Herodotus60>Herodotus, Book 2, chapter 60.</ref> This accords well with Egyptian sources that prescribe that lioness goddesses are to be appeased with the \"feasts of drunkenness\".<ref name=Velde165 /> A festival of Bastet was known to be celebrated during the New Kingdom at Bubastis. The block statue from the eighteenth dynasty ({{circa|1380 BC}}) of Nefer-ka, the wab-priest of Sekhmet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://project-min.de/home/english/restoration.html|title=restoration|website=project-min.de|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> provides written evidence for this. The inscription suggests that the king, [[Amenhotep III]], was present at the event and had great offerings made to the deity.\n\n==History==\nBastet first appears in the third millennium BC, where she is depicted as either a fierce lioness or a woman with the head of a lioness.<ref name=Velde164>Te Velde, \"Bastet\", p. 164.</ref> Two thousand years later, during the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 1070\u2013712 BC), Bastet began to be depicted as a domestic cat or a cat-headed woman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Art of Ancient Egypt: Revised Edition|last=Robins|first=Gay|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-674-03065-7|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=197}}</ref>\n\nScribes of the New Kingdom and later eras began referring to her with an additional [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] [[Affix|suffix]], as ''Bastet''. The name change is thought to have been added to emphasize pronunciation of the ending ''t'' sound, often left silent.\n\n[[Cats in ancient Egypt]] were highly revered, partly due to their ability to combat [[vermin]] such as mice, rats (which threatened key food supplies), and snakes\u2014especially [[cobra]]s. Cats of royalty were, in some instances, known to be dressed in golden jewelry and were allowed to eat from the plates of their owners. Turner and Bateson estimate that during the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] ({{circa|945\u2013715 BC}}), Bastet worship changed from being a lioness deity into being predominantly a major cat deity.<ref name=\"Serpell184\"/> Because domestic cats tend to be tender and protective of their offspring, Bastet was also regarded as a good mother and sometimes was depicted with numerous [[kitten]]s. \n\nThe native Egyptian rulers were replaced by Greeks during an occupation of Ancient Egypt in the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]] that lasted almost 300 years. The Greeks sometimes equated Bastet with one of their goddesses, [[Artemis]].<ref name=\"Delia 545\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture#Bastet}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cats in ancient Egypt]]\n*[[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Herodotus]], ed.

W. L. Poonja]] in 1986, a self-styled teacher who taught that no effort is needed to attain [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] \"because it is merely the realisation of what one already has\".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}} At their first meeting, Cohen realized that he \"had always been free\".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}} He claimed that Poonja declared him his heir so Cohen began to teach as a [[neo-Advaita]] teacher, and gathered a community around him.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}}\n\nWithin a few years, Cohen noticed that the ecstatic experiences his students had in his presence were limited.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=193}} Being convinced that he himself was fully free from [[Karma|karmic]] bondage, he began to demand more commitment from his students,{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=193}} insisting on complete \"ego-transcendence\".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=195}} This change in teaching-style led to dissent and a break with Poonja, who Cohen felt had ethical and enlightened behavioral shortcomings.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194-195}}\n\nAccording to Cohen, \"Poonja insisted that the realization of the Self had nothing to do with worldly behavior, and he did not believe fully transcending the ego was possible.\"{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} According to Poonja, \"Karmic tendencies remained after enlightenment, [but] the enlightened person was no longer identified with them and, therefore, did not accrue further karmic consequences.\"{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} For Poonja, ethical standards were based on an understanding of duality and the notion of an individual agent, and were therefore not representative of [[Advaita]]:{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} \"For Poonja, the goal was the realisation of the self; the illusory realm of relative reality was ultimately irrelevant.\"{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} Cohen did not agree, insisting instead on \"flawless behavior\" as the manifestation of enlightenment.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}}\n\nIn 1991, Cohen founded ''EnlightenNext'' magazine (under its former title, ''What Is Enlightenment?''), which \"established him as a major contemporary spiritual figure.\"{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=195}} In 2004, ''EnlightenNext'' magazine partnered with the Graduate Institute<ref group=web >{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.edu/ |title=The Graduate Institute |publisher=Learn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> in Connecticut to offer a master's program in [[conscious evolution]].

Despite also being the youngest member of the team, he is appointed the leader as he was chosen by the strongest Kiramai Stone, much to his initial dismay before he eventually settled into the role. When he first met the Kiramagers, Juru knew everyone except for Tametomo based on their fame.

He acts as an older brother figure and provides assistance when he's needed. However, he is also a selfish egotist, seeing himself as the Kiramagers' \"ace\" even when the others disagree. After Juru failed to recognize him, Tametomo developed an antagonistic relationship with him, questioning his every move and talking back to him every so often. This eventually culminated in Tametomo trying to take Juru's position away from him and prove he could be a better leader, only to botch a mission and be suspended for it. Though he quit out of anger, the girls helped Tametomo realize how selfish he was and that Juru is more qualified to be leader because of his caring personality.

Within four months, he was back in jail in [[Lima, Ohio]], but his gang sprang him, killing the jailer, Sheriff Jessie Sarber. Most of the gang was captured again by the end of the year in [[Tucson, Arizona]], due to a fire at the Historic Hotel Congress. Dillinger alone was sent to the Lake County jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana]]. He was to face trial for the suspected killing of police officer William O'Malley during a bank shootout in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], some time after his escape from jail. During this time on trial, a famous photograph was taken of Dillinger putting his arm on prosecutor Robert Estill's shoulder when suggested to him by reporters.\n* On March 3, 1934, Dillinger escaped from the \"escape-proof\" (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Crown Point, Indiana county jail, which was guarded by many police officers and national guardsmen. Newspapers reported that Dillinger had escaped using a fake gun made from wood, blackened and shined with shoe polish.\n* French prisoner [[Ren\u00e9 Belbeno\u00eet]] escaped from the penal colony of French Guiana on March 2, 1935 when he and five others took to the sea with a boat they had bought. After a series of daring adventures, during which all of the other escapees were captured, he reached United States in 1937. In 1938 his account, ''Dry Guillotine'', was published. Belbeno\u00eet had written it in French and it was translated in English by Preston Rambo. It went through 14 printings in less than a year.\n* Japanese prisoner [[Yoshie Shiratori]] broke out of prison four times between the 1930s and 1940s.

Built inside the mountain and obsolete since its opening in 1919, due to its weakness against aviation, it served as a prison. On May 22, 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], around 30 prisoners organised a mutiny for a massive prison break. 792 prisoners fled but only three succeeded in getting to the [[France|French]] border; 585 were arrested, 211 died and 14 of the arrested who were considered the leaders were sentenced to death. Most fugitives were intercepted during the following days. In 1988, a sculpture was erected to honour the memory of the Republican people dead there. The fort ceased to be a prison in 1945.\n* [[Colditz Castle]] was used as an \"escape-proof\" prisoner-of-war camp during [[World War II]], but over the course of 300 escape attempts, 130 prisoners escaped.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Thirty escapees eventually managed to reach friendly territory.

Out of the roughly 500 escapees, 231 died  and 108 were wounded. 31 killed themselves and 12 were burnt to death in huts set on fire by the Japanese.

His escape involved an elaborate tunnel leading from the shower area in his cell stretching 1.5&nbsp;km to a house construction site. The shower area in his cell was not detectable to the security cameras, creating a blind spot. The tunnel lay 10 meters underground and was equipped with a ladder to climb to the bottom, artificial lights, air ducts and various construction materials. A makeshift motorcycle was found in the tunnel, believed to have been used to excavate the tons of earth removed, transport materials and Guzm\u00e1n himself. An investigation and manhunt quickly followed. He was recaptured on January 8, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CNNMex/status/685527281587097601|title=CNN M\u00e9xico on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>\n*On January 22, 2016, three inmates escaped the [[Orange County Sheriff's Department (California)#Jails|Orange County Men's Central Jail]], a maximum security jail in [[Orange County, California]].

The two men escaped after using a \u201chard-plastic\u201d cleaning brush to knock a hole in the restroom sheet rock ceiling. The hole was in a blindspot in the communal bathroom that could only be seen by someone inside the restroom, deputies said. They then escaped by going through the 11-inch-wide hole, then through a maintenance gap between walls, and finally out a hatch that was kicked open, with the cameras nearby blocked by recent construction. After they escaped, they took off their jail jumpsuits and were wearing street clothes underneath that allowed them to blend in as they headed to [[Tijuana, Mexico]]. Fonseca and Salazar had been in rival gangs and were not known to associate with each other before being housed in the same unit of the jail. Similarly, it is unknown why the two headed for Tijuana, how they made the 7 hour trip, and why they willingly crossed into the [[U.S.]] from [[Mexico]] three days after their escape, only to be arrested by the [[U.S. Marshals]] on the border. Authorities stated they arrested the two around midnight after the pair tried to re-enter the [[United States]] from [[Mexico]]. Fonseca was accused of killing two men over three days in Salinas in June 2018. Salazar was arrested in the October 2017 shooting death of a Salinas man and the wounding of the man\u2019s wife while the couple drove in a Salinas neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/11/06/monterey-county-jail-escaped-inmates-murder-suspects-captured/2507969001/|title=BREAKING Murder suspects who escaped Monterey County Jail captured.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/12/06/monterey-county-jail-inmate-escapees/2625255001/|title=Monterey County Jail escapees used cleaning brush to break through ceiling, deputies say.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/monterey-county-escaped-inmates-captured.html|title=Escaped Murder Suspects Are Arrested Trying to Re-enter the U.S.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article236996699.html|title=Authorities explain how two murder suspects escaped from Monterey County jail.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/04/two-murder-suspects-run-after-breaking-out-northern-california-jail/|title=Two murder suspects on the run after breaking out of a Northern California jail.}}</ref>\n\n\n==People who escaped multiple times==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}\n{{expand list|date=June 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n! style=\"width:15%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Name\n! | #\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Date \n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Prison name \n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Country \n! style=\"width:50%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Details\n|-\n|rowspan=5|{{sortname|Jacques|Mesrine}}\n|rowspan=5| 5\n| 1969, August 17\n| Prison de Perc\u00e9\n| {{flag|CAN}}\n|rowspan=5| \n|-\n| 1972, August 21\n| [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]]\n| {{flag|CAN}}\n|-\n| 1972, September 3\n| [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]]\n| {{flag|CAN}}\n|-\n| 1973, June 6\n| Palais de Justice Compi\u00e8gne\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n|-\n| 1978, May 8\n| [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison|La Sant\u00e9]]\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n|-\n|rowspan=4|{{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois|Besse}}\n|rowspan=4| 7\n| 1971, May 9\n| Prison de Gradignan\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n|rowspan=4| \n|-\n| 1975, October 20\n| Prison de Fresnes\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n|-\n| 1978, May 8\n| [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison|La Sant\u00e9]]\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n|-\n| 1979, July 26\n| [[Palais de Justice, Brussels]]\n| {{flag|BEL}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|{{sortname|R\u00e9doine|Fa\u00efd}}\n|rowspan=2| 2\n| 2013, April 13 \n| Maison d'arr\u00eat de Lille-Sequedin\n| {{flag|FRA}}\n| Most wanted criminal in France in 2013.
