The AC1 Sentinel was purchased and given to the museum by [[Wargaming (company)|Wargaming Inc]], producer of the [[World of Tanks]] tank game. The Sentinel was in the United States at the [[Littlefield Collection]] when that collection sold off many of its vehicles, and Wargaming Inc desired to purchase it and return it to its original home.<ref>Salsone, Kieran.

The workshop has a number of staff and can modify and build vehicles. As of 2015, the site has expanded to house more vehicles.\n\n== Tiger 1 replica ==\n\nIn 2016, the museum workshop undertook construction of a Tiger 1 replica. This utilised a highly accurate, partially constructed Tiger 1 that was originally constructed for the movie [[Fury (2014 film)|Fury]], which in itself was an accurate replica of Tiger 131. The reconstruction utilised that upper portion of the Tiger, and also referenced original tiger parts the museum had purchased to make the whole tank. The bottom chassis was strengthened to be able to run, the first time the museum had produced its own tank from scratch. The Tiger reproduction uses a Scania truck engine. The running gear is T55 (Track,support arms and torsion bars) M110 Road wheels and the drive/ steering component is from a T62, but it is outwardly a running, almost completely accurate Tiger 1, except that the front drive sprocket (which due to the T62 T/case sits 200mm too high) and T55 Track. It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.\n\n== See also == \n*[[National Military Vehicle Museum]]\n*[[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]]\n*[[The Army Museum Bandiana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ausarmour.com Australian Armour and Artillery Museum] \u2013 official site\n* [http://www.travel-news-photos-stories.com/2014/12/new-tank-and-armour-museum-opens-in.html New Tank Museum Opens] \u2013 media report.

The 120th TCU football team played as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] (Big 12), led by 15th-year head coach [[Gary Patterson]]. The Horned Frogs played their home games at [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].\n\nTCU (11\u20132, 7\u20132) finished the season ranked #7 in the nation after a victory in the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|Alamo Bowl]]. The season marked the Horned Frogs' fifth top-10 finish and sixth top-15 finish in the last 8 seasons. The Horned Frogs notched their sixth 11+ win season in the last 8 years and their tenth 10+ win season in the 15-year Gary Patterson era.\n\n==Previous season==\nThe [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team]] notched a 12\u20131 record and finished the season ranked #3. The Horned Frogs introduced a new, up-tempo offense in 2014 under new co-offensive coordinators [[Doug Meacham]] and [[Sonny Cumbie]], led by junior quarterback [[Trevone Boykin]], who finished 4th in the 2014 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. The Frogs' sole loss came at [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|#5 Baylor]], 58\u201361. TCU knocked off three top-10 teams during their 2014 campaign, [[2014 Oklahoma Sooners football team|#4 Oklahoma]], [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|#7 Kansas State]] and [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|#9 Ole Miss]]. During the regular season, the Horned Frogs ranked as high as #3 in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|College Football Playoff Rankings]] and were in the mix to be included in the inaugural, 4-team [[College Football Playoff]]. In the next-to-last CFP rankings, the Frogs checked in at #3; however, even after a decisive 55\u20133 win over Iowa State in the final week, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee dropped the Big 12 Co-Champion Horned Frogs from #3 to #6, and out of the Playoff, in the final regular-season rankings. The Horned Frogs were invited to play in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]], in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], against the [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]] of the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]. The Horned Frogs shut down the Rebel offense and picked apart the vaunted Ole Miss defense in a decisive 42\u20133 TCU victory.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Recruiting===\nNational Signing Day unofficially kicked off the new season on February 5, 2015. The Horned Frogs inked 21 high school seniors to National Letters of Intent and added two additional playmakers by grayshirt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ten Thoughts on TCU's 2015 Recruiting Class|first=Jamie|last=Plunkett|url=http://www.frogsowar.com/2015/2/5/7982109/ten-thoughts-on-tcus-2015-recruiting-class/in/7741218|work=[[SB Nation]]|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref> Hoping to build on the success of the new up-tempo offense installed by Co-Offensive Coordinators [[Doug Meacham]] and [[Sonny Cumbie]] in 2014, the 2015 signing class included six wide receivers.

[[Josh Doctson]] broke the TCU record for receptions in a season with his 67th grab in only the Frogs' eighth game of 2015. He also joined [[Michael Crabtree]] as the only FBS wide receivers in the past 20 seasons with 6-straight games of 100 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns. After an impressive run by Trevone Boykin, [[Dana Holgorsen]] offered Trevone Boykin a high-five on the WVU sideline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Trevone Boykin-Dana Holgorsen high-five|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/105803/behind-the-trevone-boykin-dana-holgorsen-high-five|publisher=ESPN|first=Jake|last=Trotter|authorlink=Jake Trotter|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Oklahoma State===\n{{See also|2015 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

TCU played without its starting quarterback and preseason Heisman Trophy favorite [[Trevone Boykin]] after he suffered an ankle injury early in the Frogs' game against Kansas on November 14.  Leading wide receiver [[Josh Doctson]], who received Heisman Trophy consideration midseason, was also out due to a wrist injury suffered at Oklahoma State on November 7.  Including these two injuries, which topped pre-game headlines, the injury-plagued Horned Frogs squad was without its starting quarterback, 4 of their 6 top wide receivers, 2 of their 6 top offensive linemen, one starting defensive end, two starting linebackers, their starting free safety, one starting cornerback, and their starting long snapper.  Additional early-season losses had also depleted the Frogs' depth.  The Horned Frogs stormed back in the fourth quarter but failed to convert a would-be-winning-2-point try with less than a minute remaining.\n\n===Baylor===\n{{See also|2015 Baylor Bears football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The 120th TCU football team played as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] (Big 12), led by 15th-year head coach [[Gary Patterson]]. The Horned Frogs played their home games at [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].\n\nTCU (11\u20132, 7\u20132) finished the season ranked #7 in the nation after a victory in the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|Alamo Bowl]]. The season marked the Horned Frogs' fifth top-10 finish and sixth top-15 finish in the last 8 seasons. The Horned Frogs notched their sixth 11+ win season in the last 8 years and their tenth 10+ win season in the 15-year Gary Patterson era.\n\n==Previous season==\nThe [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team]] notched a 12\u20131 record and finished the season ranked #3. The Horned Frogs introduced a new, up-tempo offense in 2014 under new co-offensive coordinators [[Doug Meacham]] and [[Sonny Cumbie]], led by junior quarterback [[Trevone Boykin]], who finished 4th in the 2014 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. The Frogs' sole loss came at [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|#5 Baylor]], 58\u201361. TCU knocked off three top-10 teams during their 2014 campaign, [[2014 Oklahoma Sooners football team|#4 Oklahoma]], [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|#7 Kansas State]] and [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|#9 Ole Miss]]. During the regular season, the Horned Frogs ranked as high as #3 in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|College Football Playoff Rankings]] and were in the mix to be included in the inaugural, 4-team [[College Football Playoff]]. In the next-to-last CFP rankings, the Frogs checked in at #3; however, even after a decisive 55\u20133 win over Iowa State in the final week, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee dropped the Big 12 Co-Champion Horned Frogs from #3 to #6, and out of the Playoff, in the final regular-season rankings. The Horned Frogs were invited to play in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]], in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], against the [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]] of the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]. The Horned Frogs shut down the Rebel offense and picked apart the vaunted Ole Miss defense in a decisive 42\u20133 TCU victory.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Recruiting===\nNational Signing Day unofficially kicked off the new season on February 5, 2015.

TCU played without its starting quarterback and preseason Heisman Trophy favorite [[Trevone Boykin]] after he suffered an ankle injury early in the Frogs' game against Kansas on November 14.  Leading wide receiver [[Josh Doctson]], who received Heisman Trophy consideration midseason, was also out due to a wrist injury suffered at Oklahoma State on November 7.  Including these two injuries, which topped pre-game headlines, the injury-plagued Horned Frogs squad was without its starting quarterback, 4 of their 6 top wide receivers, 2 of their 6 top offensive linemen, one starting defensive end, two starting linebackers, their starting free safety, one starting cornerback, and their starting long snapper.  Additional early-season losses had also depleted the Frogs' depth.  The Horned Frogs stormed back in the fourth quarter but failed to convert a would-be-winning-2-point try with less than a minute remaining.\n\n===Baylor===\n{{See also|2015 Baylor Bears football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It premiered on June 13, 2003, serving as the [[series finale]]. The movie drew an audience of 5.1 million viewers.\n\n==Plot==\nLouis Stevens interrupts his older sister Ren's junior high graduation with a remote-controlled beachball meant to be full of confetti, unaware that his sidekick Beans has filled it with spaghetti, which spills on the school's gym teacher Coach Tugnut as the beachball explodes. Meanwhile, Ren breaks up with her boyfriend Gil, so she takes a job babysitting Beans. After Ren and Louis get into a fight and accidentally hurt a stranger named Miles McDermott, he talks the Stevens family and Beans into going on a vacation, which is the set of a new [[reality television|reality]] [[TV show]] called ''Family Fakeout.'' It is set on the fictional island of Mandelino, which in reality is only a short distance off the California coast.\n\nLouis accidentally destroys the sacred palace the family was meant to spend their vacation in, making the island's natives shun them and forcing them to live on their own. The family separates into two groups pitted against each other. Both groups encounter various situations, such as facing starvation and a \"killer squirrel.\" Ren seeks solace with a native named Mootai and they fall in love. Mootai is actually an actor named Jason who is supposed to romance Ren merely to boost ratings, but he is genuinely interested in her.\n\nLouis' best friend Twitty and girlfriend Tawny come to the island to rescue them. Twitty is caught by the show's staff, but he escapes and shuts down the equipment monitoring the Stevens groups. Louis' older brother Donnie finds Tawny, and the newly-reconstituted family comes together and learns the truth. They unite with Twitty and Tawny to stop Ren from killing Louis because she believes he sold her and her new boyfriend out after being told by one of the island's natives. Ren corners him on a cliff, and despite the protests of the family and Miles, who tells her the truth, she pushes him off to his apparent death, much to the viewers' and Miles' horror.\n\nAs Miles breaks down in guilt, a helicopter from another reality show, ''Gotcha'', appears and says that Louis is safe and that the Stevenses had tricked Miles; they planned a charade to get back at him for what he had done to them. Lance LeBow, the host of the TV show, ''\"Gotcha\"'', informs Miles that he is no longer a host of his own show because of his torments. He is then chased away by the Stevens family.\n\nLouis tells Ren that as his sister, he loves messing with her, but he would never do anything to hurt her. He then suggests she start a relationship with Jason back on the mainland. Jason comes and apologizes to Ren for stringing her along, but Ren forgives him and says she understood he was just doing his job as an actor. Jason confesses that when he told her he loved her, he wasn't acting and his feelings were real. After the family returns home and Beans pops up to disrupt their dinner yet again, Ren and Louis argue about who let Beans in the house. The film ends with The Twitty-Stevens Connection singing \"Dream Vacation.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Louis Stevens\n* [[Christy Carlson Romano]] as Ren Stevens\n* [[Donna Pescow]] as Eileen Stevens\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Steve Stevens\n* [[Nick Spano]] as Donnie Stevens\n* [[Steven Anthony Lawrence]] as Bernard \"Beans\" Aranguren\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Miles McDermott\n* [[A.J.

Mootai is actually an actor named Jason who is supposed to romance Ren merely to boost ratings, but he is genuinely interested in her.\n\nLouis' best friend Twitty and girlfriend Tawny come to the island to rescue them. Twitty is caught by the show's staff, but he escapes and shuts down the equipment monitoring the Stevens groups. Louis' older brother Donnie finds Tawny, and the newly-reconstituted family comes together and learns the truth. They unite with Twitty and Tawny to stop Ren from killing Louis because she believes he sold her and her new boyfriend out after being told by one of the island's natives. Ren corners him on a cliff, and despite the protests of the family and Miles, who tells her the truth, she pushes him off to his apparent death, much to the viewers' and Miles' horror.\n\nAs Miles breaks down in guilt, a helicopter from another reality show, ''\"Gotcha\"'', appears and says that Louis is safe and that the Stevenses had tricked Miles; they planned a charade to get back at him for what he had done to them. Lance LeBow, the host of the TV show, ''\"Gotcha\"'', informs Miles that he is no longer a host of his own show because of his torments. He is then chased away by the Stevens family.\n\nLouis tells Ren that as his sister, he loves messing with her, but he would never do anything to hurt her. He then suggests she start a relationship with Jason back on the mainland. Jason comes and apologizes to Ren for stringing her along, but Ren forgives him and says she understood he was just doing his job as an actor. Jason confesses that when he told her he loved her, he wasn't acting and his feelings were real. After the family returns home and Beans pops up to disrupt their dinner yet again, Ren and Louis argue about who let Beans in the house. The film ends with The Twitty-Stevens Connection singing \"Dream Vacation.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Louis Stevens\n* [[Christy Carlson Romano]] as Ren Stevens\n* [[Donna Pescow]] as Eileen Stevens\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Steve Stevens\n* [[Nick Spano]] as Donnie Stevens\n* [[Steven Anthony Lawrence]] as Bernard \"Beans\" Aranguren\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Miles McDermott\n* [[A.J.

Located approximately 18 miles northeast of downtown [[Pittsburgh]], it is part of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]]. The population was 11,761 at the 2010 census. The population of Lower Burrell was 11,150 in 2018.\n\n== History ==\nThe region in which Lower Burrell is located was originally part of the hunting reserves of the [[Iroquois]]. Permanent European settlement began in the 1760s, and Westmoreland County was created in 1773. In 1852, due to an increase in population in the area, Burrell Township was carved out of [[Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny Township]] on court order of Judge Jeremiah Murry Burrell. In 1879 Burrell Township was divided into two separate townships, Lower Burrell and [[Upper Burrell]]. The present-day cities of [[New Kensington]] and [[Arnold, Pennsylvania|Arnold]] were once part of Lower Burrell Township. In the years that followed, Lower Burrell transformed from a quiet, rural farm community to a residential and commercial area while Upper Burrell stayed primarily rural. Upper Burrell Township is still somewhat rural, though it has experienced some suburban growth in recent years due to many employment opportunities nearby. In 1959, in the midst of the growth of their community, township residents voted to make Lower Burrell a third class city. Lower Burrell continued to grow substantially until the 1980s. Like many communities in Western Pennsylvania, Lower Burrell suffered economic and population stagnation with the collapse of local heavy industry. Since the early 1990s, Lower Burrell experienced slight growth, though one of its only large shopping centers remains mostly vacant. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows that Lower Burrell has lost about 5 percent of its population since 2000.\n\nThe [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 4]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLower Burrell is located at {{coord|40|35|2|N|79|43|19|W|type:city}} (40.583966, -79.721948).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|11.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.28%) is water.\n\nInformally, the city is divided into different neighborhoods and areas including Bon Air, Braeburn, Braeburn Heights, Central City, Edgecliff, Gladeview, Indian Fields I & II and Kinloch.

[[Pompeii]] is Italy's third and the world's 48th most visited destination, with over 2.5 million tourists a year.]]\n===Beginnings===\n\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the [[Grand Tour]], beginning in the late 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th century.\n\n[[Rome]], as the capital of the powerful and influential [[Roman Empire]], attracted thousands to the city and country from all over the empire, which included most of the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, mainland Great Britain (England) and the parts of the Middle East. Traders and merchants came to Italy from several different parts of the world.\nWhen the empire fell in 476 AD, Rome was no longer the epicentre of European politics and culture; on the other hand, it was the base of the [[papacy]], which then governed the growing [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, meaning that Rome remained one of Europe's major places of pilgrimage. Pilgrims, for centuries and still today, would come to the city, and that would have been the early equivalent of \"tourism\" or \"religious tourism\". The trade empires of Venice, Pisa and Genoa meant that several traders, businessmen and merchants from all over the world would also regularly come to Italy. In the 16th and early 17th century, with the height of the Renaissance, several students came to Italy to study Italian architecture, such as [[Inigo Jones]].\n\n===Grand Tour===\n{{main|Grand Tour}}\nReal \"tourism\" only affected in Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the [[Grand Tour]]. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe; Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean places were amongst the most popular. This was in order to study ancient architecture and the local culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/grand_tour/what.html|title=Italy on the Grand Tour (Getty Exhibitions)|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book ''Voyage to Italy'', by Roman Catholic priest Richard Lassels, and published in 1670.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://vasi.uoregon.edu/grandtour.html|title=18th Century Rome and the Grand Tour|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/grandtour.htm|title=The History of the Grand Tour of Europe|author=Matt Rosenberg|work=About.com Education|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\nDue to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent  - making Italy one of the most desired destinations for millions of people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing Mobilities|last=Hom|first=Stephanie|publisher=London:Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138778146|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the city was not considered essential, and several passed by, or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came via boat, then they would remain a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was considered a vital stop,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.\n\nAs the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential city for a Grand Tourist.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> Later, they would go down to the Bay of [[Naples]],<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> and after their discovery in 1710, [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], visited the island.\n\n===Mass tourism===\n[[File:L'aquila03.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral of [[L'Aquila]]]][[File:Ravello.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Amalfi Coast]] seen from [[Villa Cimbrone]], in [[Ravello]], [[Campania]], one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy.]]\nThroughout the 17th to 18th centuries, the Grand Tour was mainly reserved for academics or the elite. Nevertheless, circa 1840,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\"/> rail transport was introduced and the Grand Tour started to fall slightly out of vogue; hence, the first form of mass-tourism was introduced. The 1840s saw the period in which the Victorian middle classes toured the country. Several Americans were also able to visit Italy, and many more tourists came to the peninsula. Places such as Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily still remained the top attractions.\nAs the century progressed, fewer cultural visits were made, and there was an increase of tourists coming for Italy's nature and weather. The first seaside resorts, such as those in the Ligurian coast, around Venice, coastal Tuscany and Amalfi, became popular. This vogue of summer holidays heightened in the [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] epoch, when numerous \"Grand Hotels\" were built (including places such as [[Sanremo]], [[Lido di Venezia]], [[Viareggio]] and [[Forte dei Marmi]]). Islands such as Capri, Ischia, Procida and Elba grew in popularity, and the Northern lakes, such as Lake Como, Maggiore and Garda were more frequently visited. Tourism to Italy remained very popular until the late-1920s and early-1930s, when, with the Great Depression and economic crisis, several could no longer afford to visit the country; the increasing political instability meant that fewer tourists came. Only old touristic groups, such as [[the Scorpioni]], remained alive.\n[[File:Vatican-Mass-Tourism-2012.JPG|right|thumb|Mass tourism, the crowd inside the Saint Peter's Basilica (Rome)]]\nAfter a big slump in tourism beginning from approximately 1929 and lasting after [[World War II]], Italy returned to its status as a popular resort, with the [[Italian economic miracle]] and raised living standards; films such as ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' were successful abroad, and their depiction of the country's perceivedly idyllic life helped raise Italy's international profile. By this point, with higher incomes, Italians could also afford to go on holiday; coastline resorts saw a soar in visitors, especially in Romagna. Many cheap hotels and ''pensioni'' (hostels) were built in the 1960s, and with the rise of wealth, by now, even a working-class Italian family could afford a holiday somewhere along the coast. The late-1960s also brought mass-popularity to mountain holidays and skiing; in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, numerous ski resorts and chalets started being built. The 1970s also brought a wave of foreign tourists to Italy in search of a sentimental trip [https://www.academia.edu/7961209/Villoresi_old_charm_-The_Trip_to_Italy Villoresi old charm -The Trip to Italy], since Mediterranean destinations saw a rise in global visitors.\n\nDespite this, by the late-1970s and early-1980s, economic crises and political instability meant that there was a significant slump in the Italian tourist industry, as destinations in the Far East or South America rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy#|title=Italy|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Yet, by the late-1980s and early-1990s, tourism saw a return to popularity, with cities such as Milan becoming more popular destinations. Milan saw a rise in tourists, since it was ripening its position as a worldwide [[fashion capital]].\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe table below shows the distribution of national and international visitor nights spent in the 40 most tourist area of Italy in 2017. \n\nItaly overall had 420.63 million visitor nights in 2017, of which 210.66 million were of foreign guests (50.08 percent).

Naples also boasts one of the most picturesque waterfront promenades, and charming locations at [[Gaiola Island]] and Marechiaro. Close to Naples there are a myriad of world-renowned tourist attractions such as the [[Amalfi Coast]], [[Capri]] island, [[Ischia]] island, [[Procida]] island, the picturesque city of [[Sorrento]], and the city of [[Salerno]].\n\n=== Other cities ===\n[[File:Genoa Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli-113860.jpg|thumb|The Mirror Gallery of the Royal Palace in [[Genoa]].]]\n* [[Florence]] (''Firenze'')&mdash;the city of Renaissance.

Due to increased tourism, in November 2016, Venetian authorities expressed their consideration on imposing a tourist limit on the city in order to prevent overcrowding and the degradation of the city's heritage sites.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/25434/20161104/venice-limit-tourists.htm|title=Venice Plans To Limit Tourists: Italian City Fights Against Overcrowding|last=News|first=Travel Today|date=2016-11-04|newspaper=TravelersToday|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Other popular destinations==\nApart from [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]], and [[Florence]] are the top destinations for tourism in Italy. Other major tourist locations include [[Turin]], [[Verona]], [[Bari]], [[Padua]], [[Bologna]], [[Messina]], [[Perugia]], [[Palermo]], [[Genoa]], [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], and [[Salento]]. Two factors in each of these locations are history and geography. The [[Roman Empire]], [[middle ages]], and [[renaissance]] have left many cultural artifacts for the Italian tourist industry to use. Many northern cities are also able to use the [[Alps]] as an attraction for [[winter sports]], while coastal southern cities have the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to draw tourists looking for sun.\n\nItaly is home to [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Italy|fifty]] [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, more than any other country, including many entire cities such as [[Verona]], [[Siena]], [[Vicenza]], [[Ferrara]], [[San Gimignano]], [[Urbino]], [[Matera]], [[Pompei]], [[Noto]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]].

[[Pompeii]] is Italy's third and the world's 48th most visited destination, with over 2.5 million tourists a year.]]\n===Beginnings===\n\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the [[Grand Tour]], beginning in the late 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th century.\n\n[[Rome]], as the capital of the powerful and influential [[Roman Empire]], attracted thousands to the city and country from all over the empire, which included most of the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, mainland Great Britain (England) and the parts of the Middle East. Traders and merchants came to Italy from several different parts of the world.\nWhen the empire fell in 476 AD, Rome was no longer the epicentre of European politics and culture; on the other hand, it was the base of the [[papacy]], which then governed the growing [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, meaning that Rome remained one of Europe's major places of pilgrimage. Pilgrims, for centuries and still today, would come to the city, and that would have been the early equivalent of \"tourism\" or \"religious tourism\". The trade empires of Venice, Pisa and Genoa meant that several traders, businessmen and merchants from all over the world would also regularly come to Italy. In the 16th and early 17th century, with the height of the Renaissance, several students came to Italy to study Italian architecture, such as [[Inigo Jones]].\n\n===Grand Tour===\n{{main|Grand Tour}}\nReal \"tourism\" only affected in Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the [[Grand Tour]]. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe; Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean places were amongst the most popular. This was in order to study ancient architecture and the local culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/grand_tour/what.html|title=Italy on the Grand Tour (Getty Exhibitions)|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book ''Voyage to Italy'', by Roman Catholic priest Richard Lassels, and published in 1670.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://vasi.uoregon.edu/grandtour.html|title=18th Century Rome and the Grand Tour|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/grandtour.htm|title=The History of the Grand Tour of Europe|author=Matt Rosenberg|work=About.com Education|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\nDue to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent  - making Italy one of the most desired destinations for millions of people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing Mobilities|last=Hom|first=Stephanie|publisher=London:Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138778146|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the city was not considered essential, and several passed by, or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came via boat, then they would remain a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was considered a vital stop,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.\n\nAs the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential city for a Grand Tourist.<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> Later, they would go down to the Bay of [[Naples]],<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\" /> and after their discovery in 1710, [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], visited the island.\n\n===Mass tourism===\n[[File:L'aquila03.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral of [[L'Aquila]]]][[File:Ravello.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Amalfi Coast]] seen from [[Villa Cimbrone]], in [[Ravello]], [[Campania]], one of the most popular tourist destinations in Italy.]]\nThroughout the 17th to 18th centuries, the Grand Tour was mainly reserved for academics or the elite. Nevertheless, circa 1840,<ref name=\"vasi.uoregon.edu\"/> rail transport was introduced and the Grand Tour started to fall slightly out of vogue; hence, the first form of mass-tourism was introduced. The 1840s saw the period in which the Victorian middle classes toured the country. Several Americans were also able to visit Italy, and many more tourists came to the peninsula. Places such as Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily still remained the top attractions.\nAs the century progressed, fewer cultural visits were made, and there was an increase of tourists coming for Italy's nature and weather. The first seaside resorts, such as those in the Ligurian coast, around Venice, coastal Tuscany and Amalfi, became popular. This vogue of summer holidays heightened in the [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] epoch, when numerous \"Grand Hotels\" were built (including places such as [[Sanremo]], [[Lido di Venezia]], [[Viareggio]] and [[Forte dei Marmi]]). Islands such as Capri, Ischia, Procida and Elba grew in popularity, and the Northern lakes, such as Lake Como, Maggiore and Garda were more frequently visited. Tourism to Italy remained very popular until the late-1920s and early-1930s, when, with the Great Depression and economic crisis, several could no longer afford to visit the country; the increasing political instability meant that fewer tourists came. Only old touristic groups, such as [[the Scorpioni]], remained alive.\n[[File:Vatican-Mass-Tourism-2012.JPG|right|thumb|Mass tourism, the crowd inside the Saint Peter's Basilica (Rome)]]\nAfter a big slump in tourism beginning from approximately 1929 and lasting after [[World War II]], Italy returned to its status as a popular resort, with the [[Italian economic miracle]] and raised living standards; films such as ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' were successful abroad, and their depiction of the country's perceivedly idyllic life helped raise Italy's international profile. By this point, with higher incomes, Italians could also afford to go on holiday; coastline resorts saw a soar in visitors, especially in Romagna. Many cheap hotels and ''pensioni'' (hostels) were built in the 1960s, and with the rise of wealth, by now, even a working-class Italian family could afford a holiday somewhere along the coast. The late-1960s also brought mass-popularity to mountain holidays and skiing; in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, numerous ski resorts and chalets started being built. The 1970s also brought a wave of foreign tourists to Italy in search of a sentimental trip [https://www.academia.edu/7961209/Villoresi_old_charm_-The_Trip_to_Italy Villoresi old charm -The Trip to Italy], since Mediterranean destinations saw a rise in global visitors.\n\nDespite this, by the late-1970s and early-1980s, economic crises and political instability meant that there was a significant slump in the Italian tourist industry, as destinations in the Far East or South America rose in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy#|title=Italy|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Yet, by the late-1980s and early-1990s, tourism saw a return to popularity, with cities such as Milan becoming more popular destinations. Milan saw a rise in tourists, since it was ripening its position as a worldwide [[fashion capital]].\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe table below shows the distribution of national and international visitor nights spent in the 40 most tourist area of Italy in 2017. \n\nItaly overall had 420.63 million visitor nights in 2017, of which 210.66 million were of foreign guests (50.08 percent).
