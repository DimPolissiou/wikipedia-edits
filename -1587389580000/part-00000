Even those who are unable to leave their own home or who live far from assessment providers may be assessed (and assisted) remotely using [[remote desktop software]] and a [[web cam]]. For example, the assessor logs on to the client's computer via a [[broadband]] [[Internet]] connection, observes the user's computer skills, and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client's computer where necessary.\n\n== Accessibility options for specific impairments ==\n[[File:BBC News web accessibility demo.jpg|thumb|[[BBC News]] shown in 'desktop mode,' with accessibility links at the top. The screenshot is taken from Windows Mobile.]]\n[[File:Single switch onscreen keyboard.jpg|thumb|A single-switch [[assistive device]] that enables the user to access an [[on-screen keyboard]]]]\n\n=== Cognitive impairments and illiteracy ===\nThe biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities - particularly those with poor communication and reading skills. As an example, people with learning disabilities may rely on proprietary symbols and thus identify particular products via the product's symbols or icons.  Unfortunately copyright laws can limit icon or symbol release to web-based programs and websites by owners who are unwilling to release them to the public.\n\nIn these situations, an alternative approach for users who want to access public computer based terminals in [[libraries]], [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], and information kiosks is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a [[smart card]], that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etcetera to their particular needs.  The concept is encompassed by the [[Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation|CEN]] standard \"Identification card systems \u2013 Human-machine interface\".<ref>CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations Personal identification, electronic signature and cards and their related systems and operations - Structure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005012815/http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations |date=2013-10-05 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiresias.org/research/reports/en1332_4_revision.htm |title=Draft EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface - Part 4 : Coding of user requirements for people with special needs |publisher=Tiresias.org |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref> This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the Local Authority Smartcards Standards e-Organisation (LASSeO) specifications.<ref>LASSeO: [http://www.lasseo.org.uk/papers/130640%20final%20report.pdf Feasibility Studies - Final Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814090117/http://lasseo.org.uk/papers/130640%20final%20report.pdf |date=2013-08-14 }}. August 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Visual impairment ===\nSince computer interfaces often solicit visual input and provide visual feedback, another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable by people with visual impairments. For individuals with mild to medium vision impairment, it is helpful to use large [[Typeface|font]]s, high DPI displays, high-contrast themes and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s supplemented with auditory feedback and screen magnifying software.  In the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness, [[screen reader]] software that provides feedback via [[text to speech]] or a [[refreshable braille display]] is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer.\n\nAbout 8% of people suffer from some form of [[Color blindness|color-blindness]]. The main color combinations that might be confused by people with visual deficiency include red/green and blue/green. However, in a well-designed user interface, color will not be the primary way to distinguish between different pieces of information.\n\n=== Motor and dexterity impairments ===\nSome people may not be able to use a conventional [[input device]], such as the [[computer mouse|mouse]] or the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], therefore, it is important for software functions to be accessible using both devices.  Ideally, software will use a generic input [[API]] that permits the use even of highly specialized devices unheard of at the time of software's initial development. [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and [[mouse gesture]]s are ways to achieve this access, as are more specialized solutions, including on-screen software keyboards and alternate input devices ([[Switch Access|switches]], [[joystick]]s and [[trackball]]s). Users may enable a [[Bounce keys|bounce key]] feature, allowing the keyboard to ignore repeated presses of the same key. [[Speech recognition]] technology is also a compelling and suitable alternative to conventional keyboard and mouse input as it simply requires a commonly available audio headset.\n\nThe [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]]'s use of assistive technology is an example of a person with severe motor and physical limitations who uses technology to support [[activities of daily living]]. He used a switch, combined with special software, that allowed him to control his [[wheelchair]]-mounted computer using his limited and small movement ability. This personalized system allowed him to remain mobile, do research, produce his written work.  Prof. Hawking also used [[augmentative and alternative communication]] technology to speak and an [[environmental control device]] to access equipment independently.\n\nA small amount of modern research indicates that utilizing a standard computer mouse device improves fine-motor skills.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/12/click-here-improve-your-motor-skills | title=Click here to improve your motor skills | work=Science | date=December 19, 2013 | accessdate=23 December 2013 | author=Bohannon, John}}</ref>\n\n=== Hearing impairment ===\nWhile [[sound user interface]]s have a secondary role in common desktop computing, these interfaces are usually limited to using [[system sound]]s such as feedback.  Some software producers take into account people who can't hear due to hearing impairments, [[silence]] requirements or lack of sound producing software.  System sounds like beeps can be substituted or supplemented with visual notifications and captioned text (akin to [[closed captioning]]). Closed captions are a very popular means of relaying information for the Deaf and hearing impaired communities.\n\n== Types of software accessibility ==\n\n=== Accessibility application programming interfaces ===\nSoftware [[API]]s (application programming interfaces) exist to allow assistive technology products such as [[screen reader]]s and [[screen magnifiers]] to work with mainstream software. The current or past APIs include:\n* Java Accessibility and the [[Java Access Bridge]] for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software<ref>Oracle: [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/access/index.html Java Accessibility]</ref><ref>Oracle: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-136191.html Java SE Desktop Accessibility] (page containing a link to the Java Access Bridge).</ref> (being standardized as ISO/IEC TR 13066-6<ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=180&ics3=&csnumber=54004 ISO/IEC PRF TR 13066-6: Information technology -- Interoperability with Assistive Technology (AT) -- Part 6: Java accessibility application programming interface (API)].</ref>);\n* [[Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface]] (AT-SPI) on [[UNIX]] and [[Linux]] (being standardized as ISO/IEC PDTR 13066-4 <ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=180&ics3=&csnumber=54001 ISO/IEC PDTR 13066-4: Information Technology - Interoperability with Assistive Technology (AT) -- Part 4: Linux/UNIX graphical environments accessibility API].</ref>);\n* [[Microsoft Active Accessibility]] (MSAA) on [[Microsoft Windows]];\n* [[IAccessible2]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], a competitor of Microsoft UI Automation also replacing MSAA by [[Free Standards Group]] (standardized as ISO/IEC 13066-3:2012<ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53998 ISO/IEC TR 13066-3:2012: Information technology -- Interoperability with assistive technology (AT) -- Part 3: IAccessible2 accessibility application programming interface (API)].</ref>);\n* [[Mac OS X]] Accessibility;\n* [[Microsoft UI Automation]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], replacing MSAA.\n\nSome of these APIs are being standardized in the [[ISO/IEC 13066]] series of standards.<ref>Richard Hodgkinson: [http://www.snapi.org.uk/info/standards/report_7.htm 7th Report on International ICT Accessibility Standards Proposed, Being Developed and Recently Published]. 3 October 2008.</ref><ref>Richard Hodgkinson: [http://www.tiresias.org/research/standards/report_10.htm 10th Report on International ICT Accessibility Standards Proposed, Being Developed and Recently Published]. 26 June 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Accessibility features in mainstream software ===\nAccessibility software can also make input devices easier to access at the user level. These include:\n* [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and [[MouseKeys]] allow the user to substitute keyboarding for mouse actions. [[Macro recorder]]s can greatly extend the range and sophistication of keyboard shortcuts.\n* [[Sticky keys]] allows characters or commands to be typed without having to hold down a [[modifier key]] (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, ClickLock<ref>Microsoft: [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-xp/help/using-clicklock Using ClickLock]</ref> is a [[Microsoft Windows]] feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down while scrolling.\n* Customization of mouse or mouse alternatives' responsiveness to movement, double-clicking, and so forth.\n* [[ToggleKeys]]<ref>Microsoft: [https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/access_togglekeys_turnon.mspx To turn on ToggleKeys]. Windows XP Professional Product Documentation.</ref> is a feature of [[Microsoft Windows]] 95 onwards. A high sound is heard when the [[caps lock]], [[scroll lock]], or [[number lock]] key is switched on. A low sound is heard when any of those keys is switched off.\n* Customization of [[pointer (user interface)|pointer]] appearance, such as size, color and shape.\n* [[Predictive text]]\n* [[Spell checker]]s and [[grammar checker]]s\n\n=== Support for learning disabilities ===\nOther approaches may be particularly relevant to users with a learning disability.

Accessed 2013-01-17.</ref> provides an outline of the steps that must be in place in order for any [[computing platform]] to be considered accessible. These steps are analogous to those necessary to make a physical or built environment accessible. The OAF divides the required steps into two categories: creation and use.\n\nThe \u201ccreation\u201d steps describe the precursors and building blocks required for technology developers to create accessible applications and products. They are as follows:\n# Define what \u201caccessible\u201d means for the identified use of the platform.  It must be clear what is meant by \u201caccessible\u201d as this will differ according to the [[modality (human\u2013computer interaction)|modality]] and capabilities of each platform. Accessibility features may include [[tabbing navigation]], [[Theme (computing)|theming]], and an [[Screen reader#Accessibility APIs|accessibility API]].\n# Provide accessible stock [[Elements of graphical user interfaces|user interface elements]]. Pre-built \u201cstock\u201d user interface elements, used by application developers and authoring tools, must be implemented to make use of the accessibility features of a platform. \n# Provide authoring tools that support accessibility. Application developers and content authors should be encouraged to implement tools that will improve the accessibility features of a platform. Using these tools can support accessible stock user interface elements, prompt for information required to properly implement an accessibility API, and identify accessibility evaluation and repair tools.\n\nThe \u201cuse\u201d steps describe what is necessary in the computing environment in which these accessible applications will run. They are as follows:\n# Provide platform supports. Computing platforms must properly implement the accessibility features that are specified in their accessibility definition. For example, the accessibility API definitions must be implemented correctly in the program code.\n# Provide accessible [[Computer applications|application software]]. Accessible applications must be available for the platform and they must support the accessibility features of the platform. This may be achieved by simply engaging the accessible stock elements and authoring tools that support accessibility.\n# Provide [[assistive technologies]]. Assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice input, adapted keyboards) must actually be available for the platform so that the users can effectively interface with the technology.\n\nThe following examples show that the OAF can be applied to different types of platforms: desktop operating systems, web applications<ref>AEGIS Consortium: [http://www.aegis-project.eu/images/docs/ApprovedDeliverablesForWebsite/AEGIS_D3.1.2_final.pdf AEGIS Architecture Definition].

Accessible technology can enable [[personalized learning]] for all students.\n\n==== Students who can benefit from personalized learning ====\nIn most classrooms, students can benefit from the following:\n\n# Easier to see PC's for those who have a hard time seeing the board.\n# Less cluttered PC's for those who have difficulty concentrating.\n# Easier to hear PC's for those who have difficulty hearing the teacher speak.\n\n==== Impacts in the classroom ====\nWhen accessible technology allows personalized learning, there are positive impacts on students. Personalized learning switches the focus from what is being taught to what is being learned. This allows the students needs to become an integral part of the learning process. Accessibility in the classroom allows millions of students of all backgrounds to have equal educational opportunities and keep up with their non-disabled peers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hasselbring|first=Ted|last2=Williams Glaser|first2=Candyce|date=March 2012|title=Use of Computer Technology to Help Students with Special Needs|journal=The Future of Children|volume=10|issue=2|pages=102\u201322|pmid=11255702|doi=10.2307/1602691|jstor=1602691|id={{ProQuest|222336763}}}}</ref>\n\nWhen PC's are personalized for students in the classroom, students are more comfortable in the classroom, special needs students are better assisted and teachers can save time and effort.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1523977320/parklandsdorg/scxoldfn8ywuvxfok0aj/Accessibility-in-Education-Workshop-long-9-23-15.pdf|title=Accessibility in Education|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Microsoft|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile PC's can provide a large amount of support in the classroom, iPads and apps can play a large role as well.

In the past few years, adults have had their disabilities accommodated by the ability to work from home and by the availability of reliable software. This allows workers to work in a comfortable area while still being able to support themselves. This is allowing thousands of people with disabilities to create and earn jobs for themselves. The inexpensiveness and reliability of computers has facilitated the process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/technology/computer-technology-opens-a-world-of-work-to-disabled-people.html|title=Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People|last=Joachim|first=David S.|date=2006-03-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Standards and regulations regarding computer accessibility ==\n\n=== Section 508 ===\nSection 508 is a standard that is regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. This department ensures that all information and communications technology is accessible to disabled users. Their responsibilities includes designing websites, software, hardware, video and multimedia and telecommunications that meet accessibility standards. The standards themselves were created by an independent federal agency that works on accessibility for people with disabilities known as the US Access Board. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/accessibility/what-section-508|title=What is Section 508?|last=US EPA|first=OEI|date=2013-09-26|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== International Standards ===\n\n; <nowiki>ISO 9241-171:2008</nowiki>\n\nISO 9241-171:2008 is a standard that provides [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]] guidance and specifications for the design of accessible software for public use. \n\nCompiled from independent standards experts, this document is the most comprehensive and technical standard for designing accessible features for software,  covering all disabilities and all aspects of software. It provides examples of two priority levels ('Required' and 'Recommended') and offers a handy checklist designed to help with recording software testing results.\n\nThe only trouble is that because of its complexity and technical nature, and with upwards of 150 individual statements, ISO 9241-172 is difficult to interpret and apply. Luckily, not every statement is relevant to every situation, therefore it may be advisable to identify a subset of statements that are tailored to the particular software environment, making the use of this document much more achievable. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/03/90/39080.html|title=ISO 9241-171:2008|last=14:00-17:00|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Assistive technology|Assistive Technology]]\n* [[Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Accessibility Technologist]]\n* [[Fire Vox]]\n* [[Game accessibility]]\n* [[Knowbility]]\n* [[Modding]]\n* [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]\n* [[Web accessibility]]\n* [https://www.uk-assignments.com Assignment Help]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|en-computer-accessibility.ogg|2006-09-17}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.interaction-design.org/references/conferences/series/ercim_workshop_on_user_interfaces_for_all.html The annual ERCIM Workshop on 'User Interfaces for All'] emphasising accessibility\n* [http://www.betterlivingthroughtechnology.com Better Living Through Technology] - contains guides on accessibility options and information about specialist assistive hardware and software\n* [http://www.hp.com/accessibility/ HP Accessibility]\n* [http://www.abilitynet.org.uk AbilityNet] - provides information on Accessibility, Assistive Technology and Remote Assessment\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110623021557/http://www.c4ea.org/ C4EA] Consortium For E-learning Accessibility\n* [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040214081242/http://www.opera.com/features/access/ Accessibility in the Opera web browser]\n* [https://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/ Mozilla Accessibility Project]\n* [http://ui.openoffice.org/accessibility/ Open Office Accessibility Project]\n* [http://www.guide-project.eu EU Project GUIDE: Multimodal user interfaces for elderly people with mild impairments]\n\n{{Computer science}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Accessibility}}\n[[Category:Computer accessibility| ]]\n\n[[es:Accesibilidad]]\n[[it:Accessibilit\u00e0 (informatica)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Ability of a computer system to be used by all people}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{cleanup|reason=confusingly laid out |date=September 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n}}\n\n'''Computer accessibility''' (also known as '''accessible computing''') refers to the [[accessibility]] of a [[computer system]] to all people, regardless of [[disability]] type or severity of impairment. The term ''accessibility'' is most often used in reference to specialized hardware or [[software]], or a combination of both, designed to enable use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment. Computer accessibility often has direct positive effects on people with disabilities.  \n\nAccessibility features are meant to make the use of technology less challenging for those with disabilities. Common accessibility features include [[Text to Speech|text-to-speech]], [[Closed captioning|closed-captioning]], and [[Keyboard shortcut|keyboard shortcuts]]. More specific technologies that need additional hardware may be referred to as [[assistive technology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Ting-Fang|last2=Meng|first2=Ling-Fu|last3=Wang|first3=Hwa-Pey|last4=Wu|first4=Wu-Tien|last5=Li|first5=Tien-Yu|date=2002|editor-last=Miesenberger|editor-first=Klaus|editor2-last=Klaus|editor2-first=Joachim|editor3-last=Zagler|editor3-first=Wolfgang|title=Computer Access Assessment for Persons with Physical Disabilities: A Guide to Assistive Technology Interventions|journal=Computers Helping People with Special Needs|volume=2398|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages=204\u2013211|doi=10.1007/3-540-45491-8_44|isbn=978-3-540-45491-5}}</ref>\n\nThere are many disabilities or impairments that can be a barrier to effective computer use. These impairments, which can be acquired from [[disease]], [[Major trauma|trauma]], or may be [[Congenital disorder|congenital]], include but are not limited to:\n*[[Cognitive disabilities|Cognitive impairments]] (head injury, autism, developmental disabilities) and [[learning disabilities]], (such as [[dyslexia]], [[dyscalculia]], or [[ADHD]]).\n*[[Visual impairment]], such as low-vision, complete or partial [[blindness]], and [[color blindness]].\n*Hearing-related disabilities (deafness), including [[deafness]], being [[hard of hearing]], or [[hyperacusis]].\n*Motor or dexterity impairment such as [[paralysis]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[Developmental coordination disorder|dyspraxia]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], and [[repetitive strain injury]].\n\nA topic closely linked to computer accessibility is [[web accessibility]]. Similar to computer accessibility, web accessibility is the practice of making the use of the [[World Wide Web]] easier for individuals with disabilities.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAccessibility is often abbreviated as the [[numeronym]] '''''a11y''''', where the number 11 refers to the number of letters omitted. This parallels the abbreviations of [[internationalization and localization|''internationalization'' and ''localization'']] as ''i18n'' and ''l10n'', respectively.\n\n== Assessment for assistive technology use ==\nPeople wishing to overcome an impairment in order to use a computer comfortably and productively may require a \"special needs assessment\" by an [[assistive technology]] consultant (such as an [[occupational therapist]], a [[rehabilitation engineering technologist]], or an [[Educational Technologist|educational technologist]]) to help them identify and configure appropriate assistive technologies to meet individual needs.  Even those who are unable to leave their own home or who live far from assessment providers may be assessed (and assisted) remotely using [[remote desktop software]] and a [[web cam]]. For example, the assessor logs on to the client's computer via a [[broadband]] [[Internet]] connection, observes the user's computer skills, and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client's computer where necessary.\n\n== Accessibility options for specific impairments ==\n[[File:BBC News web accessibility demo.jpg|thumb|[[BBC News]] shown in 'desktop mode,' with accessibility links at the top. The screenshot is taken from Windows Mobile.]]\n[[File:Single switch onscreen keyboard.jpg|thumb|A single-switch [[assistive device]] that enables the user to access an [[on-screen keyboard]]]]\n\n=== Cognitive impairments and illiteracy ===\nThe biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities - particularly those with poor communication and reading skills. As an example, people with learning disabilities may rely on proprietary symbols and thus identify particular products via the product's symbols or icons.  Unfortunately copyright laws can limit icon or symbol release to web-based programs and websites by owners who are unwilling to release them to the public.\n\nIn these situations, an alternative approach for users who want to access public computer based terminals in [[libraries]], [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], and information kiosks is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a [[smart card]], that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etcetera to their particular needs.  The concept is encompassed by the [[Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation|CEN]] standard \"Identification card systems \u2013 Human-machine interface\".<ref>CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations Personal identification, electronic signature and cards and their related systems and operations - Structure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005012815/http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations |date=2013-10-05 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiresias.org/research/reports/en1332_4_revision.htm |title=Draft EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface - Part 4 : Coding of user requirements for people with special needs |publisher=Tiresias.org |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref> This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the Local Authority Smartcards Standards e-Organisation (LASSeO) specifications.<ref>LASSeO: [http://www.lasseo.org.uk/papers/130640%20final%20report.pdf Feasibility Studies - Final Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814090117/http://lasseo.org.uk/papers/130640%20final%20report.pdf |date=2013-08-14 }}. August 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Visual impairment ===\nSince computer interfaces often solicit visual input and provide visual feedback, another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable by people with visual impairments. For individuals with mild to medium vision impairment, it is helpful to use large [[Typeface|font]]s, high DPI displays, high-contrast themes and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s supplemented with auditory feedback and screen magnifying software.  In the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness, [[screen reader]] software that provides feedback via [[text to speech]] or a [[refreshable braille display]] is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer.\n\nAbout 8% of people suffer from some form of [[Color blindness|color-blindness]]. The main color combinations that might be confused by people with visual deficiency include red/green and blue/green. However, in a well-designed user interface, color will not be the primary way to distinguish between different pieces of information.\n\n=== Motor and dexterity impairments ===\nSome people may not be able to use a conventional [[input device]], such as the [[computer mouse|mouse]] or the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], therefore, it is important for software functions to be accessible using both devices.  Ideally, software will use a generic input [[API]] that permits the use even of highly specialized devices unheard of at the time of software's initial development. [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and [[mouse gesture]]s are ways to achieve this access, as are more specialized solutions, including on-screen software keyboards and alternate input devices ([[Switch Access|switches]], [[joystick]]s and [[trackball]]s). Users may enable a [[Bounce keys|bounce key]] feature, allowing the keyboard to ignore repeated presses of the same key. [[Speech recognition]] technology is also a compelling and suitable alternative to conventional keyboard and mouse input as it simply requires a commonly available audio headset.\n\nThe [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]]'s use of assistive technology is an example of a person with severe motor and physical limitations who uses technology to support [[activities of daily living]]. He used a switch, combined with special software, that allowed him to control his [[wheelchair]]-mounted computer using his limited and small movement ability. This personalized system allowed him to remain mobile, do research, produce his written work.  Prof. Hawking also used [[augmentative and alternative communication]] technology to speak and an [[environmental control device]] to access equipment independently.\n\nA small amount of modern research indicates that utilizing a standard computer mouse device improves fine-motor skills.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/12/click-here-improve-your-motor-skills | title=Click here to improve your motor skills | work=Science | date=December 19, 2013 | accessdate=23 December 2013 | author=Bohannon, John}}</ref>\n\n=== Hearing impairment ===\nWhile [[sound user interface]]s have a secondary role in common desktop computing, these interfaces are usually limited to using [[system sound]]s such as feedback.  Some software producers take into account people who can't hear due to hearing impairments, [[silence]] requirements or lack of sound producing software.  System sounds like beeps can be substituted or supplemented with visual notifications and captioned text (akin to [[closed captioning]]). Closed captions are a very popular means of relaying information for the Deaf and hearing impaired communities.\n\n== Types of software accessibility ==\n\n=== Accessibility application programming interfaces ===\nSoftware [[API]]s (application programming interfaces) exist to allow assistive technology products such as [[screen reader]]s and [[screen magnifiers]] to work with mainstream software. The current or past APIs include:\n* Java Accessibility and the [[Java Access Bridge]] for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software<ref>Oracle: [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/access/index.html Java Accessibility]</ref><ref>Oracle: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-136191.html Java SE Desktop Accessibility] (page containing a link to the Java Access Bridge).</ref> (being standardized as ISO/IEC TR 13066-6<ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=180&ics3=&csnumber=54004 ISO/IEC PRF TR 13066-6: Information technology -- Interoperability with Assistive Technology (AT) -- Part 6: Java accessibility application programming interface (API)].</ref>);\n* [[Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface]] (AT-SPI) on [[UNIX]] and [[Linux]] (being standardized as ISO/IEC PDTR 13066-4 <ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=180&ics3=&csnumber=54001 ISO/IEC PDTR 13066-4: Information Technology - Interoperability with Assistive Technology (AT) -- Part 4: Linux/UNIX graphical environments accessibility API].</ref>);\n* [[Microsoft Active Accessibility]] (MSAA) on [[Microsoft Windows]];\n* [[IAccessible2]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], a competitor of Microsoft UI Automation also replacing MSAA by [[Free Standards Group]] (standardized as ISO/IEC 13066-3:2012<ref>ISO: [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53998 ISO/IEC TR 13066-3:2012: Information technology -- Interoperability with assistive technology (AT) -- Part 3: IAccessible2 accessibility application programming interface (API)].</ref>);\n* [[Mac OS X]] Accessibility;\n* [[Microsoft UI Automation]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], replacing MSAA.\n\nSome of these APIs are being standardized in the [[ISO/IEC 13066]] series of standards.<ref>Richard Hodgkinson: [http://www.snapi.org.uk/info/standards/report_7.htm 7th Report on International ICT Accessibility Standards Proposed, Being Developed and Recently Published]. 3 October 2008.</ref><ref>Richard Hodgkinson: [http://www.tiresias.org/research/standards/report_10.htm 10th Report on International ICT Accessibility Standards Proposed, Being Developed and Recently Published]. 26 June 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Accessibility features in mainstream software ===\nAccessibility software can also make input devices easier to access at the user level. These include:\n* [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and [[MouseKeys]] allow the user to substitute keyboarding for mouse actions. [[Macro recorder]]s can greatly extend the range and sophistication of keyboard shortcuts.\n* [[Sticky keys]] allows characters or commands to be typed without having to hold down a [[modifier key]] (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, ClickLock<ref>Microsoft: [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-xp/help/using-clicklock Using ClickLock]</ref> is a [[Microsoft Windows]] feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down while scrolling.\n* Customization of mouse or mouse alternatives' responsiveness to movement, double-clicking, and so forth.\n* [[ToggleKeys]]<ref>Microsoft: [https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/access_togglekeys_turnon.mspx To turn on ToggleKeys].

A high sound is heard when the [[caps lock]], [[scroll lock]], or [[number lock]] key is switched on. A low sound is heard when any of those keys is switched off.\n* Customization of [[pointer (user interface)|pointer]] appearance, such as size, color and shape.\n* [[Predictive text]]\n* [[Spell checker]]s and [[grammar checker]]s\n\n=== Support for learning disabilities ===\nOther approaches may be particularly relevant to users with a learning disability.

Accessed 2013-01-17.</ref> provides an outline of the steps that must be in place in order for any [[computing platform]] to be considered accessible. These steps are analogous to those necessary to make a physical or built environment accessible. The OAF divides the required steps into two categories: creation and use.\n\nThe \u201ccreation\u201d steps describe the precursors and building blocks required for technology developers to create accessible applications and products. They are as follows:\n# Define what \u201caccessible\u201d means for the identified use of the platform.  It must be clear what is meant by \u201caccessible\u201d as this will differ according to the [[modality (human\u2013computer interaction)|modality]] and capabilities of each platform. Accessibility features may include [[tabbing navigation]], [[Theme (computing)|theming]], and an [[Screen reader#Accessibility APIs|accessibility API]].\n# Provide accessible stock [[Elements of graphical user interfaces|user interface elements]]. Pre-built \u201cstock\u201d user interface elements, used by application developers and authoring tools, must be implemented to make use of the accessibility features of a platform. \n# Provide authoring tools that support accessibility. Application developers and content authors should be encouraged to implement tools that will improve the accessibility features of a platform. Using these tools can support accessible stock user interface elements, prompt for information required to properly implement an accessibility API, and identify accessibility evaluation and repair tools.\n\nThe \u201cuse\u201d steps describe what is necessary in the computing environment in which these accessible applications will run. They are as follows:\n# Provide platform supports. Computing platforms must properly implement the accessibility features that are specified in their accessibility definition. For example, the accessibility API definitions must be implemented correctly in the program code.\n# Provide accessible [[Computer applications|application software]]. Accessible applications must be available for the platform and they must support the accessibility features of the platform. This may be achieved by simply engaging the accessible stock elements and authoring tools that support accessibility.\n# Provide [[assistive technologies]]. Assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice input, adapted keyboards) must actually be available for the platform so that the users can effectively interface with the technology.\n\nThe following examples show that the OAF can be applied to different types of platforms: desktop operating systems, web applications<ref>AEGIS Consortium: [http://www.aegis-project.eu/images/docs/ApprovedDeliverablesForWebsite/AEGIS_D3.1.2_final.pdf AEGIS Architecture Definition].

Accessible technology can enable [[personalized learning]] for all students.\n\n==== Students who can benefit from personalized learning ====\nIn most classrooms, students can benefit from the following:\n\n# Easier to see PC's for those who have a hard time seeing the board.\n# Less cluttered PC's for those who have difficulty concentrating.\n# Easier to hear PC's for those who have difficulty hearing the teacher speak.\n\n==== Impacts in the classroom ====\nWhen accessible technology allows personalized learning, there are positive impacts on students. Personalized learning switches the focus from what is being taught to what is being learned. This allows the students needs to become an integral part of the learning process. Accessibility in the classroom allows millions of students of all backgrounds to have equal educational opportunities and keep up with their non-disabled peers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hasselbring|first=Ted|last2=Williams Glaser|first2=Candyce|date=March 2012|title=Use of Computer Technology to Help Students with Special Needs|journal=The Future of Children|volume=10|issue=2|pages=102\u201322|pmid=11255702|doi=10.2307/1602691|jstor=1602691|id={{ProQuest|222336763}}}}</ref>\n\nWhen PC's are personalized for students in the classroom, students are more comfortable in the classroom, special needs students are better assisted and teachers can save time and effort.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1523977320/parklandsdorg/scxoldfn8ywuvxfok0aj/Accessibility-in-Education-Workshop-long-9-23-15.pdf|title=Accessibility in Education|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Microsoft|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile PC's can provide a large amount of support in the classroom, iPads and apps can play a large role as well. There are constantly apps being developed for the aid of teachers, parents, and children.

The advantages include interactivity, Internet access and text messaging.

In the past few years, adults have had their disabilities accommodated by the ability to work from home and by the availability of reliable software. This allows workers to work in a comfortable area while still being able to support themselves. This is allowing thousands of people with disabilities to create and earn jobs for themselves. The inexpensiveness and reliability of computers has facilitated the process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/technology/computer-technology-opens-a-world-of-work-to-disabled-people.html|title=Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People|last=Joachim|first=David S.|date=2006-03-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Standards and regulations regarding computer accessibility ==\n\n=== Section 508 ===\nSection 508 is a standard that is regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. This department ensures that all information and communications technology is accessible to disabled users.

It provides examples of two priority levels ('Required' and 'Recommended') and offers a handy checklist designed to help with recording software testing results.\n\nThe only trouble is that because of its complexity and technical nature, and with upwards of 150 individual statements, ISO 9241-172 is difficult to interpret and apply. Luckily, not every statement is relevant to every situation, therefore it may be advisable to identify a subset of statements that are tailored to the particular software environment, making the use of this document much more achievable. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/03/90/39080.html|title=ISO 9241-171:2008|last=14:00-17:00|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Assistive technology|Assistive Technology]]\n* [[Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Accessibility Technologist]]\n* [[Fire Vox]]\n* [[Game accessibility]]\n* [[Knowbility]]\n* [[Modding]]\n* [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]\n* [[Web accessibility]]\n* [https://www.uk-assignments.com Assignment Help]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|en-computer-accessibility.ogg|2006-09-17}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.interaction-design.org/references/conferences/series/ercim_workshop_on_user_interfaces_for_all.html The annual ERCIM Workshop on 'User Interfaces for All'] emphasising accessibility\n* [http://www.betterlivingthroughtechnology.com Better Living Through Technology] - contains guides on accessibility options and information about specialist assistive hardware and software\n* [http://www.hp.com/accessibility/ HP Accessibility]\n* [http://www.abilitynet.org.uk AbilityNet] - provides information on Accessibility, Assistive Technology and Remote Assessment\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110623021557/http://www.c4ea.org/ C4EA] Consortium For E-learning Accessibility\n* [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040214081242/http://www.opera.com/features/access/ Accessibility in the Opera web browser]\n* [https://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/ Mozilla Accessibility Project]\n* [http://ui.openoffice.org/accessibility/ Open Office Accessibility Project]\n* [http://www.guide-project.eu EU Project GUIDE: Multimodal user interfaces for elderly people with mild impairments]\n\n{{Computer science}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Accessibility}}\n[[Category:Computer accessibility| ]]\n\n[[es:Accesibilidad]]\n[[it:Accessibilit\u00e0 (informatica)]]\n", "name_user": "2604:2d80:900b:7000:d426:4e39:321c:5f0e", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility"}

He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing.

G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11&nbsp;million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>\n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress.\n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30\u201340,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released.

During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry. The cork leg is displayed at the Illinois State Military Museum in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]].<ref>[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/public-displays-santa-annas-life-and-limb/Content?oid=902666 \"Public Displays: Santa Anna's life and limb\", by S.L.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842. The new Congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3338755|title = Generals versus Politicians: Santa Anna and the 1842 Congressional Elections in Mexico|journal = Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 257\u2013274|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1989|doi = 10.2307/3338755}}</ref>\n\nTrying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844. The buried leg he left behind in the capital was dug up by a mob and dragged through the streets until nothing was left of it.{{sfn|Camnitzer|2009}}{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=239}} Fearing for his life, he tried to elude capture, but in January 1845 he was apprehended by a group of Native Americans near [[Xico, Veracruz]]. They turned him over to authorities, and Santa Anna was imprisoned. His life was spared, but he was exiled to [[Cuba]], still a Spanish colony.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War, 1846\u20131848                                                           ===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1870.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna circa 1870.]]\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 07 Battle of Churubusco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Churubusco]], during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], 20 August 1847]]\n\nIn 1846, Mexican and American troops moved towards the Rio Grande into the disputed [[Nueces Strip]]. Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end. His actions would prolong the war for at least a year, and more than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino ''The Dead March'', p. 88.</ref>\n\n===President for the last time, 1853-55===\n{{See also|Second Mexican Republic|Plan of Ayutla}}\n[[File:Gadsden Purchase Cities ZP.svg|thumb|Gadsden Purchase of 1854, territory purchased by the U.S. for a better transcontinental railway route]]\nFollowing defeat in the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848, Santa Anna went into exile in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853. Santa Anna honored his promises to the Church, revoking a decree denying protection for the fulfillment of monastic vows, a reform promulgated twenty years earlier during the era of [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. President Santa Anna had left running the government in 1833 to his liberal vice president.<ref name=mecham-358-59>Mecham, ''Church and State'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had been expelled from Spanish realms by the crown in 1767, were allowed to return to Mexico ostensibly to educate poorer classes, and much of their property, which the crown had confiscated and sold, was restored to them.<ref name=mecham-358-59/>\n\nAlthough he gave himself exalted titles, Santa Anna's situation was quite vulnerable. He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsden thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>\n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.  Mme.

The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children. In his will, Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, Mar\u00eda de la Merced, Petra, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.

He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful.

He was perceived as a hero by his troops, as he sought glory for himself and his army and independence for Mexico. He repeatedly rebuilt his reputation after major losses. Yet at the same time, historians and many Mexicans also rank him as one of \"those who failed the nation.\"<ref>Archer, Christon I. \"Fashioning a New Nation\" in Michael C. Meyer and William H. Beezley, eds. ''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. But his leadership in the Mexican-American War and his willingness to fight to the bitter end prolonged the war. \"More than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter.

He was overthrown by the liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]] in 1855 and lived most of his later years in exile.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAntonio de Padua Mar\u00eda Severino L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna y P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n was born in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[New Spain|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain), on 21 February 1794. He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing. According to Mexican historian [[Enrique Krauze]], \"It annoyed him and bored him, and perhaps frightened him.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 137.</ref> A biographer of Santa Anna described him in this period as the \"absentee president.\"<ref>Fowler, Will.

Santa Anna retired to his Veracruz hacienda, [[Manga de Clavo]].

He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress. \n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30-40,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G. Burnet]] and Santa Anna signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], the latter under duress, stating that \"in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas.\" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842.

Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844.

Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853.

He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsden thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>   \n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.  Mme. Calder\u00f3n de la Barca observed that \"After breakfast, the Se\u00f1ora having dispatched an officer for her cigar-case, which was gold with a diamond latch, offered me a cigar, which I having declined, she lighted her own, a little paper 'cigarette', and the gentlemen followed her good example.\"<ref>Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, F. ''Life in Mexico''. London: Century, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nTwo months after the death of his wife In\u00e9s Garc\u00eda in 1844, the 50-year-old Santa Anna married 16-year-old Mar\u00eda de Los Dolores de Tosta. The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children. In his will, Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, Mar\u00eda de la Merced, Petra, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. Biographers have identified three more: Pedro L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, and \u00c1ngel and Augustina Rosa L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=92}}\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:Tumbasantaanna.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and his second wife, Sra. Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna]]\n\nFrom 1855 to 1874, Santa Anna lived in exile in Cuba, the United States, Colombia, and the then Danish island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]].  He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful. Instead, Adams helped to found the chewing gum industry with a product that he called \"[[chiclets]].\"<ref name=\"Staten\">[http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084919/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 |date=27 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his many years in exile, Santa Anna was a passionate fan of the sport of [[cockfighting]]. He had many roosters that he entered into competitions, and would have his roosters compete with cocks from all over the world.<ref name=\":0\" /> He would invite breeders from all over the world for matches and is known to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on prize [[rooster]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn 1874, he took advantage of a general amnesty and returned to Mexico. Crippled and almost blind from [[cataracts]], he was ignored by the Mexican government that same year at the anniversary of the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. Having retreated from politics in 1855, he remained disconnected until his death in 1876.<ref name=\":0\" /> Santa Anna died at his home in Mexico City on 21 June 1876 at age 82. He was buried with full military honors in a glass coffin in Pante\u00f3n del Tepeyac Cemetery.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico}}\n*[[List of heads of state of Mexico]]\n*[[History of democracy in Mexico]]\n\n==Note==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|title=On Art, Artists, Latin America, and Other Utopias |last=Camnitzer |first=Luis |editor-last=Weiss |editor-first=Rachel |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780292783492 |page=199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsotPY30RfkC&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|title=Tornel and Santa Anna: the writer and the caudillo, Mexico, 1795\u20131853\n |last=Fowler |first=Will|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n |year=2000|isbn=978-0-313-30914-4|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftOV3nd78KQC&pg=PA20}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv\n |last=Fowler|first=Will|title=Santa Anna of Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFszaXaypkoC|accessdate=17 August 2012\n |date=1 November 2009|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2638-8}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

When Booth decided to kill Lincoln, [[Andrew Johnson]], and Seward in order to create chaos in the federal government and possibly stave off Confederate defeat, Powell was assigned the task of killing Seward. At 10:10 P.M. on April 14, 1865, just as Booth was preparing to shoot Lincoln at Ford\u2019s Theater by gaining entry to the unguarded presidential box, Powell entered Seward's home, pretending to deliver medicine to Seward, who was in bed recovering from injuries sustained in a carriage accident. Denied entry to Seward's room by one of the suspicious family members, including the African American ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and [[Frederick W. Seward|Frederick]], Powell started back down the stairs, but suddenly turned and drew his revolver, pointing it at Frederick\u2019s forehead. He pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Powell then struck Frederick several times with the pistol, and he crumpled to the floor unconscious. [[Frances Adeline \"Fanny\" Seward|Fanny Seward]] came out of her father's room to see her brother bloody and unconscious on the floor and Powell running towards her. After Powell shoved her aside, he ran to Seward's bed and began stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck.

Seward]] who was best known for his role in foiling the assassination attempt of William Seward by [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]] for which he was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1871.\n\nRobinson joined [[8th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|8th Maine Infantry]] in August 1863, and was serving as an attendant to Seward while recovering from battlefield wounds. He was honorably discharged in May 1865 but returned to the Army as a [[major]] in June 1879, and was retired in August 1896 after serving for 20 years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hcaauctions.com/lot-11813.aspx |title=Lot #423:  | publisher=Raynor's Historical Collectible Auctions | accessdate=2015-02-07}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nGeorge F.

When Booth decided to kill Lincoln, [[Andrew Johnson]], and Seward in order to create chaos in the federal government and possibly stave off Confederate defeat, Powell was assigned the task of killing Seward. At 10:10 P.M. on April 14, 1865, just as Booth was preparing to shoot Lincoln at Ford\u2019s Theater by gaining entry to the unguarded presidential box, Powell entered Seward's home, pretending to deliver medicine to Seward, who was in bed recovering from injuries sustained in a carriage accident. Denied entry to Seward's room by one of the suspicious family members, including the African American ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and [[Frederick W. Seward|Frederick]], Powell started back down the stairs, but suddenly turned and drew his revolver, pointing it at Frederick\u2019s forehead. He pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Powell then struck Frederick several times with the pistol, and he crumpled to the floor unconscious. [[Frances Adeline \"Fanny\" Seward|Fanny Seward]] came out of her father's room to see her brother bloody and unconscious on the floor and Powell running towards her. After Powell shoved her aside, he ran to Seward's bed and began stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. He missed the first time he swung his knife down, but the third blow sliced open Seward's cheek.<ref name=\"trialbook\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BJv0EPr7ygC&pg=PA20&dq=George+F.+Robinson+lincoln | title=The Trial: The Assassination of President Lincoln and the Trial of the Conspirators | publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] | editor=Edward Steers | year=2010 | page=20 |isbn=0-8131-2277-5 }}</ref> The splint on Seward's broken jaw was the only thing that prevented Powell's blade from penetrating Seward's [[jugular]] vein.<ref name=\"trialbook\"/>\n\nPrivate George F.

It is bordered by [[Overijssel]] to the south, [[Friesland]] to the west, [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] to the north, and the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Lower Saxony]] to the east. As of November 2019, Drenthe had a population of 493,449<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table</ref> and a total area of {{convert|2680|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\nDrenthe has been populated for 150,000 years. The region has subsequently been part of the [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht]], [[Habsburg Netherlands]], [[Dutch Republic]], [[Batavian Republic]], [[Kingdom of Holland]] and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Drenthe has been an official province since 1796. The capital and seat of the provincial government is [[Assen]]. The [[King's Commissioner]] of Drenthe is [[Jetta Klijnsma]]. The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) is the largest party in the [[States-Provincial]], followed by the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA).\n\nDrenthe is a sparsely populated rural area, unlike many other parts of the Netherlands. Except for the cities of [[Assen]] (pop. 67,963<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table</ref>)  and [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]] (pop. 107,113), the land in Drenthe is mainly used for [[agriculture]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:D49 is gedeeltelijk overdekt door een dekheuvel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Papeloze Kerk]], a [[dolmen]] (''hunebed'') near [[Schoonoord, Coevorden|Schoonoord]]]]\n[[File:Netherlands, Province of Drenthe, map of 1866.PNG|thumb|left|Map of Drenthe, 1866]]\n\nThe name Drenthe is said to stem from ''thrija-hantja'' meaning \"three lands\".\n\nDrenthe has been populated by people since prehistory. Artifacts from the [[Wolstonian Stage]] (150,000 years ago) are among the oldest found in the Netherlands. In fact, it was one of the most densely populated areas of the Netherlands until the Bronze Age. The most tangible evidence of this are the [[dolmen]]s (''[[hunebed]]den'') built around 3500 BC. 53 of the 54 dolmens in the Netherlands can be found in Drenthe, concentrated in the northeast of the province. In 2006, the archaeological reserve of [[Strubben-Kniphorstbos]], located between [[Anloo]] and [[Schipborg]], was created to preserve part of this heritage.\n\nDrenthe was first mentioned in a document from 820, it was called ''Pago Treanth'' (Drenthe district). In archives from ''Het Utrechts Archief'', from 1024 to 1025, the \"county Drenthe\" is mentioned, when Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] gave it to Bishop [[Adalbold II of Utrecht]].\n\nAfter long being subject to the [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht diocese]], Bishop [[Henry of the Palatinate (bishop)|Henry of Wittelsbach]] in 1528 ceded Drenthe to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg]], who incorporated it into the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. When the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]] was declared in 1581, Drenthe became part of it as the [[County of Drenthe]], although it never gained full provincial status due to its poverty{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}; the province was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the States General. The successor [[Batavian Republic]] granted it provincial status on 1 January 1796.\n\nShortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Dutch government built a camp near the town of [[Hooghalen]] to intern German Jewish refugees. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the German occupiers used the camp (which they named [[Westerbork transit camp|KZ Westerbork]]) as a ''[[Durchgangslager]]'' (transit camp). Many Dutch [[Jew]]s, [[Sinti]], [[Romani people|Roma]], resistance combatants and political adversaries were imprisoned before being transferred to [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s in Germany and occupied Poland. [[Anne Frank]] was deported on the last train leaving the Westerbork transit camp on 3 September 1944.\n\nIn the 1970s, there were four [[Hostage crisis|hostage crises]] where [[Republic of South Maluku|South Moluccan]] terrorists demanded an independent [[Republic of South Maluku]]. They held hostages in hijacked trains in [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis|1975]]<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Marianne van Exel, [http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/toen/december/molukse_treinkaping_bij_wijster/ Molukse treinkaping bij Wijster] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223223853/http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/toen/december/molukse_treinkaping_bij_wijster/ |date=2013-12-23 }}, ''IS Geschiedenis'', 2011.

It is bordered by [[Overijssel]] to the south, [[Friesland]] to the west, [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] to the north, and the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Lower Saxony]] to the east. As of November 2019, Drenthe had a population of 493,449<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table</ref> and a total area of {{convert|2680|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\nDrenthe has been populated for 150,000 years. The region has subsequently been part of the [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht]], [[Habsburg Netherlands]], [[Dutch Republic]], [[Batavian Republic]], [[Kingdom of Holland]] and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Drenthe has been an official province since 1796. The capital and seat of the provincial government is [[Assen]]. The [[King's Commissioner]] of Drenthe is [[Jetta Klijnsma]]. The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) is the largest party in the [[States-Provincial]], followed by the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA).\n\nDrenthe is a sparsely populated rural area, unlike many other parts of the Netherlands. Except for the cities of [[Assen]] (pop. 67,963<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table</ref>)  and [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]] (pop. 107,113), the land in Drenthe is mainly used for [[agriculture]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:D49 is gedeeltelijk overdekt door een dekheuvel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Papeloze Kerk]], a [[dolmen]] (''hunebed'') near [[Schoonoord, Coevorden|Schoonoord]]]]\n[[File:Netherlands, Province of Drenthe, map of 1866.PNG|thumb|left|Map of Drenthe, 1866]]\n\nThe name Drenthe is said to stem from ''thrija-hantja'' meaning \"three lands\".\n\nDrenthe has been populated by people since prehistory. Artifacts from the [[Wolstonian Stage]] (150,000 years ago) are among the oldest found in the Netherlands. In fact, it was one of the most densely populated areas of the Netherlands until the Bronze Age. The most tangible evidence of this are the [[dolmen]]s (''[[hunebed]]den'') built around 3500 BC. 53 of the 54 dolmens in the Netherlands can be found in Drenthe, concentrated in the northeast of the province. In 2006, the archaeological reserve of [[Strubben-Kniphorstbos]], located between [[Anloo]] and [[Schipborg]], was created to preserve part of this heritage.\n\nDrenthe was first mentioned in a document from 820, it was called ''Pago Treanth'' (Drenthe district). In archives from ''Het Utrechts Archief'', from 1024 to 1025, the \"county Drenthe\" is mentioned, when Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] gave it to Bishop [[Adalbold II of Utrecht]].\n\nAfter long being subject to the [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht diocese]], Bishop [[Henry of the Palatinate (bishop)|Henry of Wittelsbach]] in 1528 ceded Drenthe to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg]], who incorporated it into the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. When the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]] was declared in 1581, Drenthe became part of it as the [[County of Drenthe]], although it never gained full provincial status due to its poverty{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}; the province was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the States General. The successor [[Batavian Republic]] granted it provincial status on 1 January 1796.\n\nShortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Dutch government built a camp near the town of [[Hooghalen]] to intern German Jewish refugees. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the German occupiers used the camp (which they named [[Westerbork transit camp|KZ Westerbork]]) as a ''[[Durchgangslager]]'' (transit camp). Many Dutch [[Jew]]s, [[Sinti]], [[Romani people|Roma]], resistance combatants and political adversaries were imprisoned before being transferred to [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s in Germany and occupied Poland. [[Anne Frank]] was deported on the last train leaving the Westerbork transit camp on 3 September 1944.\n\nIn the 1970s, there were four [[Hostage crisis|hostage crises]] where [[Republic of South Maluku|South Moluccan]] terrorists demanded an independent [[Republic of South Maluku]]. They held hostages in hijacked trains in [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis|1975]]<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Marianne van Exel, [http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/toen/december/molukse_treinkaping_bij_wijster/ Molukse treinkaping bij Wijster] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223223853/http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/toen/december/molukse_treinkaping_bij_wijster/ |date=2013-12-23 }}, ''IS Geschiedenis'', 2011.
