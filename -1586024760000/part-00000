There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record.

The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders.

Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art (which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref>) and Ackerman was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nAckerman did later file a request to prolong his lease on the film rights for another six months, but his inability to secure a producer made him unable to pay for the extension, and the negotiations were terminated.<ref>{{ME-ref|carpenter}}</ref><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the following years, Tolkien entered brief negotiations for an adaptation with Robert Gutwillig, but nothing came out of it.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only recieved a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee\u200f|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).\n\nThe designs were done  by Rankin and Bass (particularly [[Arthur Rankin Jr.|Rankin]]). Lester Abrams sent Rankin 20 character designs after Rankin and Bass liked his work on an excerpt of Tolkien's for ''Children's Digest'' at the time. He was brought on board again later in the production to help illustrate the Dwarves \u2013 basing Thorin on concept art for Disney's Grumpy.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce the story as two or three animated films.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films focused on procuring the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings.'' Zaentz also acquired the rights to produce The Hobbit, but not to distribute it: perhaps because they saw The Hobbit are more film-friendly, UA kept the distribution rights to themselves.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.<ref name=\"IMDb-awards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000835/awards|title=Awards for Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> The film cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce and grossed $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising. \n\nSome B-roll footage was shot for the sequel, and Bakshi began working on a script<ref name=\":9\" /> with Beagle (who was promised a job on the sequel) and he and Zaentz attempted to sue Rankin and Bass ''Lord of the Rings'' TV special from airing to avoid overlap with their film.

Despite the name it was based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' rather than ''The Hobbit''; but it included only the parts of the story that the hobbits had witnessed themselves (hence the title). The nine episodes were aired on [[Yle TV1]]. The series was written and directed by [[Timo Torikka]].

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's [[Bad Taste|''Bad Taste'']], had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

In 2008, Guillermo Del Toro was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. Time constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.  Tel Toro's The Hobbit would have had a similar scenario to Jackson's eventual film, but with a different design aesthetic. He considered sky replacement and other changes.\n\nDuring principal photography, Jackson looked at assembled footage and decided to split the piece into three installments, which were released between 2012 and 2014.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art (which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref>) and Ackerman was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nAckerman did later file a request to prolong his lease on the film rights for another six months, but his inability to secure a producer made him unable to pay for the extension, and the negotiations were terminated.<ref>{{ME-ref|carpenter}}</ref><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the following years, Tolkien entered brief negotiations for an adaptation with Robert Gutwillig, but nothing came out of it. Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only recieved a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee\u200f|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=1119656028, 9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf. [[Donovan]] was keen on Merry, and they wanted [[Twiggy]] for Galadriel and \u201ca lot of other people\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/sd-me-music-beatles-lord-of-the-rings-20180731-story.html|title=Help!

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce the story as two or three animated films.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project.

Zaentz also acquired the rights to produce The Hobbit, but not to distribute it: perhaps because they saw The Hobbit are more film-friendly, UA kept the distribution rights to themselves.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.<ref name=\"IMDb-awards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000835/awards|title=Awards for Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> The film cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce and grossed $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising. \n\nSome B-roll footage was shot for the sequel, and Bakshi began working on a script<ref name=\":9\" /> with Beagle (who was promised a job on the sequel) and he and Zaentz attempted to sue Rankin and Bass ''Lord of the Rings'' TV special from airing to avoid overlap with their film.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time. He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned of Forrest Ackerman's attempt, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003.

It was released by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] as the fifth [[Single (music)|single]] from Eilish's debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote \"Bad Guy\", with the latter producing it and the former providing additional production. The song was described as [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]], [[pop-trap]], and [[Goth rock|nu-goth]] [[pop music|pop]] in press reviews, for which [[synth bass]], a [[kick drum]], finger snaps and [[Roland TR-808|808 bass]] provide minimalist instrumentation. During the song's lyrics, Eilish taunts her lover for being a [[wiktionary:bad boy|bad guy]] although suggesting that she is more resilient than him, and further touches on themes about [[misandry]] and sarcasm.\n\nUpon its release, \"Bad Guy\" received mainly positive reviews. It was also likened to music recorded by [[the White Stripes]], [[Lorde]] and [[Fiona Apple]]. \"Bad Guy\" was a commercial success, reaching number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], as well as on the [[record chart|charts]] in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and Russia. In the United States, \"Bad Guy\" ended the record-breaking 19-week run of \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]. \"Bad Guy\" also peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], among others. It has been awarded several [[Music recording certification|certification]]s, most notably a sextuple platinum award from [[Music Canada]] and the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). \"Bad Guy\" has received several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. \n\n[[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] directed the music video for \"Bad Guy\" which was uploaded onto Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the single's digital release. The video depicts Eilish being involved in several activities, including wild dancing, suffering a nosebleed and sitting on the back of a man doing [[push-up]]s. Reviewers noted the video for its [[camp (style)|camp]] elements and eccentric imagery. For promotional purposes, Eilish performed the song on several occasions and also included it on the set list for her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] (2019) and [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]] (2020). On July 11, 2019, a remix of \"Bad Guy\" featuring Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] was released to mixed reviews from critics, who mostly commented on Bieber's vocals.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.<ref name=\"credits\"/>]]\n\n[[Billie Eilish]] released her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' on March 29, 2019, via Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|title=Billie Eilish's Debut LP 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'

It was released by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] as the fifth [[Single (music)|single]] from Eilish's debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote \"Bad Guy\", with the latter producing it and the former providing additional production. The song was described as [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]], [[pop-trap]], and [[Goth rock|nu-goth]] [[pop music|pop]] in press reviews, for which [[synth bass]], a [[kick drum]], finger snaps and [[Roland TR-808|808 bass]] provide minimalist instrumentation. During the song's lyrics, Eilish taunts her lover for being a [[wiktionary:bad boy|bad guy]] although suggesting that she is more resilient than him, and further touches on themes about [[misandry]] and sarcasm.\n\nUpon its release, \"Bad Guy\" received mainly positive reviews. It was also likened to music recorded by [[the White Stripes]], [[Lorde]] and [[Fiona Apple]]. \"Bad Guy\" was a commercial success, reaching number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], as well as on the [[record chart|charts]] in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and Russia. In the United States, \"Bad Guy\" ended the record-breaking 19-week run of \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]. \"Bad Guy\" also peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], among others. It has been awarded several [[Music recording certification|certification]]s, most notably a sextuple platinum award from [[Music Canada]] and the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). \"Bad Guy\" has received several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. \n\n[[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] directed the music video for \"Bad Guy\" which was uploaded onto Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the single's digital release. The video depicts Eilish being involved in several activities, including wild dancing, suffering a nosebleed and sitting on the back of a man doing [[push-up]]s. Reviewers noted the video for its [[camp (style)|camp]] elements and eccentric imagery. For promotional purposes, Eilish performed the song on several occasions and also included it on the set list for her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] (2019) and [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]] (2020). On July 11, 2019, a remix of \"Bad Guy\" featuring Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] was released to mixed reviews from critics, who mostly commented on Bieber's vocals.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.<ref name=\"credits\"/>]]\n\n[[Billie Eilish]] released her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' on March 29, 2019, via Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|title=Billie Eilish's Debut LP 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'

There remain, as of 2016, twelve (12) sovereign '''monarchies in Europe'''. Seven are [[Realm|kingdoms]]: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Monaco]] are [[Principality|principalities]], while Luxembourg is a [[Grand duchy|Grand Duchy]]. The [[Vatican City]] is a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] state ruled by the [[Pope]].\n\nThe monarchies can be divided into two broad classes: pre-modern states and those that gained their independence during or immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Spain, and Andorra are the successors to pre-modern monarchies. Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were established or gained independence through various methods during the Napoleonic Wars. The [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]] was recognized as a sovereign state administered by the [[Holy See]] in 1929. \n\nTen of these monarchies are [[Hereditary title|hereditary]], and two are elective: Vatican City (the Pope, elected at the [[papal conclave]]), and [[Andorra]] (technically a semi-elective diarchy, the joint heads of state being the elected [[President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]], appointed by the Pope).\n\nMost of the monarchies in Europe are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. The exceptions are [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]], which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and Vatican City, which is a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]]. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see [[monarchism]] and [[republicanism]]) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] in the United Kingdom). Currently six of the twelve monarchies are members of the [[European Union]]: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and [[San Marino]] were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of [[republicanism]] to the political [[mainstream]] started only at the beginning of the 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the [[Sovereign state|states]] in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected [[head of state]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|Map of [[Mycenaean Greece]].]]\nThe notion of kingship in Europe ultimately originates in systems of [[tribal kingship]] in [[prehistoric Europe]]. The [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 1400 BCE) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in [[protohistory|protohistoric]] Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the [[Linear B]] script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about society in the Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of [[palace economy|palace economies]].<ref name=\"Blois71\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 71\u201372.</ref> The role of kings changed in the following [[Greek Dark Ages]] (c. 1100 \u2013 c. 750 BCE) to big [[gentleman farmer]]s with military power.<ref name=\"Blois71\"/>\n\n=== Archaic and classical antiquity ===\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|left|thumb|The [[Pnyx]], as [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|meeting place]] the heart of [[Athenian democracy]].]]\nSince the beginning of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was in the hands of a number of people that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (c. 750\u2013500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek [[Polis|poleis]],<ref name=\"Blois74\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 74.</ref> and [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|also in Rome]] (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility ([[aristocracy]]), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations ([[tyranny]], 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy ([[oligarchy]]) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in [[Classical Greece]] (mainly after 500 BCE).<ref name=\"Blois86\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 86\u201387.</ref> [[Athenian democracy]] (6th century\u2013322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; [[Sparta|classical Sparta]] (c. 550\u2013371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy ([[List of kings of Sparta|dual kingship]]), aristocracy ([[Gerousia]]) and democracy ([[Apella]]);<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"geronten\".</ref> the [[Roman Republic]] (c. 509\u201327 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Romeinse Rijk. \u00a72. Staatsinstellingen\".</ref> The city-states of the [[Etruscan civilization]] (which arose during the [[Villanovan culture|Villanovan period]], c. 900\u2013700 BCE) appear to have followed a similar pattern, with the original monarchies being overthrown and replaced by oligarchic republics in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.<ref name=\"KandG Etruscans\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkySjRwUteE |title=Etruscans: Italian Civilization Before Ancient Rome |author=Leo Stone, Ilkin Gambar, Officially Devin, Nolan Karimov, Andr\u00e1s Szente-Dzsida |work=Kings and Generals |publisher=YouTube |date=20 February 2020 |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>{{rp|at=8:18}}\n\n[[File:Tetradrachm of Philip II. 359-336 BCE.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian king]] [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] united all Greek poleis under his crown in 338 BCE.]]\nThe dominant poleis of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and Sparta were weakened by warring each other, especially during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BCE) won by Sparta. They were defeated and ruled by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] for a time (371\u2013360 BCE), after which Sparta's role was over. Eventually, all of Greece was subjugated by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian monarchy]] in 338 BCE, that put an end to the era of free autonomous city-states, and Athenian democracy as well in 322 BCE.<ref>De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 103\u2013106.</ref> In the subsequent [[Hellenistic period]] (334\u201330 BCE)<ref name=\"Encarta\">Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"hellenisme\".</ref> numerous [[diadoch]]s (successors of [[Alexander the Great]]) fought one another for the kingship of Macedon, definitively obtained by the [[Antigonids]] in 277 BCE.<ref name=\"Blois127\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 127.</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Phoenicia]]n city-state of [[Carthage]], located in present-day [[Tunisia]], aside from settling large swaths of North Africa's coast, also set up several colonies on [[Sicily]], Sardinia, Corsica, the [[Balearic Islands|Baleares]] and in [[Carthaginian Iberia|southern Iberia]].<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Carthago. \u00a71. Geschiedenis\".</ref> The Carthaginian empire, according to tradition founded in 814 BCE, started out as a monarchy, but in the 4th century transformed into a republic where [[Shophet|suffets]] (\"judges\") ruled. Finally, Rome gradually conquered all of Italy (primarily after 350 BCE), and defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BCE). In 168, Macedon was [[Macedonian Wars|subdued by the Romans]], and partitioned into four client republics. These were annexed as Roman provinces in 148, as happened to Greece in 146,<ref name=\"Blois127\"/> making Rome's territory envelop all of literate Europe. The remainder of Iberia, the Illyrian coast and eventually [[Gaul]] by general [[Julius Caesar]] were added to the Roman Republic, which however was experiencing an institutional crisis. After defeating his rival [[Pompey]], Caesar was appointed ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' to restore order. He almost managed to found a dynasty in the process, but was killed by a republican cabal led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in 44 BCE.\n\n=== Roman Empire and legacy ===\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|The first Roman Emperor, [[Augustus]] ([[r.]] 27 BCE\u201314 CE).]]\nCaesar's adoptive son Octavian prevailed in the ensuing civil war, and converted the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BCE. He took on the name [[Augustus]], with the rather humble title of [[princeps]] (\"first [citizen]\"), as if he were merely ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\"), when he had in fact founded a monarchy. This limited emperorship ([[Principate]]) was strengthened in 284 by [[Diocletian]] to absolute reign ([[Dominate]]).<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Diocletianus, Gaius Aurelius Valerius.\"</ref> The Empire recognised various [[client kingdom]]s under imperial suzerainty; most of these were in Asia, but tribal client kings were also recognized by the Roman authorities [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|in Britannia]]. Most of the [[barbarian kingdoms]] established in the 5th century \n(the kingdoms of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi]], [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundi]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[kingdom of the Franks|Franks]], [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]]) recognised the Roman Emperor at least nominally, and Germanic kingdoms would continue to mint coins depicting the Roman emperor well into the 6th century.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'' (1937), 46&ndash;48.</ref>\nIt was this derivation of the authority of kingship from the Christian Roman Empire that would be at the core of the medieval institution of kingship in Europe and its notion of the [[divine right of kings]], as well as the position of the Pope in [[Latin Christendom]], the restoration of the Roman Empire under [[Charlemagne]] and the derived concept of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western and Central Europe.\n\n===Medieval Europe===\nThe monarchies of Europe in the Christian [[Middle Ages]] derived their claim from [[Christianisation]] and the [[divine right of kings]], partly influenced by the notion of [[Germanic king|sacral kingship]] inherited from [[Germanic antiquity]].\nThe [[great power]]s of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]] were the result of a gradual process of centralization of power taking place over the course of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe [[Early Middle Ages]] begin with a fragmentation of the former [[Western Roman Empire]] into \"[[barbarian kingdoms]]\". In Western Europe, the kingdom of the [[Franks]] developed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] by the 8th century, and the [[Heptarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] were unified into the [[kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. \nWith the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of [[feudalism]] places kings at the head of a pyramid of relationships between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of [[baron]]s, and the intermediate positions of [[counts]] (or [[earl]]s) and [[duke]]s. The core of European feudal [[manorialism]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] were the territories of the [[kingdom of France]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (centered on the nominal kingdoms of [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]) and the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].\n\n===Early Modern Europe===\n\n[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|European dominions of the House of Habsburg in 1700]]\nWith the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]], the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of [[James I of England]] (1603\u20131625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567\u20131625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\n[[Early modern Europe]] was dominated by the [[Wars of Religion]], notably the [[Thirty Years' War]], during which the major European monarchies developed into centralised [[great power]]s sustained by their [[colonial empire]]s.\nThe main European powers in the early modern period were:\n*the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] with its [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]]\n*the [[Portuguese Empire]] of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Iberian Union|personal union with Spain]] 1580&ndash;1640)\n*the [[Spanish Empire]] of [[Habsburg Spain]] (after 1700 [[Bourbon Spain]])\n*the [[British Empire]] of the English and Scottish [[Union of the Crowns]] (after 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]])\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was increasingly dominated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and by [[Prussia]]\n*the [[Tsardom of Russia]]\n*the kingdom of Poland as the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n*the kingdom of Sweden rose to the status of great power as the comparatively short-lived [[Swedish Empire]] due to the Thirty Years' War \n*the kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]]\n\nThe [[House of Habsburg]] became the most influential royal dynasty in continental Europe by the 17th century, divided into the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] branches.\n\n===Modern Europe===\n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|Map of Europe in 1815]]\nThe modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649, followed by the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u201383) and especially the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399). The absolutist [[Kingdom of France]] was first transformed to a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy (1791\u201392)]], before being [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fully abolished]] on 21 September 1792, and eventually the [[Execution of Louis XVI|former king even executed]], to the other European courts' great shock. During the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131799), the great European monarchies were unable to restore the monarchy; instead, the [[French First Republic]] expanded and annexed neighbouring territories, or converted them into loyal [[sister republic]]s. Meanwhile, the [[German Mediatization]] of 1803 thoroughly rearranged the political structure of the Holy Roman Empire, with many small principalities and all ecclesiastical lands being annexed by larger monarchies. After [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|Napoleon seized power]], however, he gradually constructed a new imperial order in French-controlled Europe, first by [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning himself Emperor of the French]] in 1804, and then converting the sister republics into monarchies ruled by his relatives.\n\nFollowing Napoleon's defeat in 1814 and 1815, the reactionary [[Congress of Vienna]] determined that all of Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon dynasty was restored]], replaced by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The popular [[Napoleon III]] was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the [[Second French Empire]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|\"Two Sicilies\"]]) were absorbed into the [[kingdom of Sardinia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with [[Austro-Prussian War|Prussia emerging victorious]] in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, [[Franco-Prussian War|defeat France]] and absorb the southern German states into the [[German Empire]] in the process (1870\u201371). From the ashes of the Second Empire rose the [[French Third Republic]], the only great republican European power until World War I.\n\nMuch of 19th century politics was characterised by the division between [[republicanism|anti-monarchist]] [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] [[conservatism]]. \nThe Kingdom of Spain was [[First Spanish Republic|briefly abolished]] in 1873, [[Restoration (Spain)|restored]] 1874&ndash;1931 and again [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|in 1978]].\nThe [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was abolished in 1910. The [[Russian Empire]] ended in 1917, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1918.\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] fell [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|under Habsburg rule]] in 1867 and was dissolved in 1918 ([[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|restored]] 1920\u20131946). Likewise, the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] under Habsburg rule was dissolved in 1918.\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] transformed the political landscape of Europe, and a number of modern kingdoms were formed in a resurgence of monarchism after the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]:\n\n*{{flagicon|Austria|variant=empire}} the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] (1804\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|W\u00fcrttemberg}} the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Bavaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1805 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Saxony}} the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (1806&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1816).svg}} the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] (1808\u20131861)\n*{{flagicon|France|variant=1814}} the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]] (1814&ndash;1848)\n*{{flagicon|Hannover}} the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814\u20131866)\n*{{flagicon|Poland|variant=1815}} the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (1815&ndash;1867/[[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|1918]])\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] (1830 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Germany|variant=empire}} the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Greece|variant=old}} the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (1832&ndash;1973)\n*{{flagicon|Italy|variant=1861}} the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861&ndash;1946)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1882\u20131947)\n*{{flagicon|Russia|variant=empire}} the [[Russian Empire]] (1721\u20131917)\n*{{flagicon|Serbia|variant=1882}} the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (1882\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] (1908\u20131946)\nMany countries [[Abolished monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] in the 20th century and became republics, especially in the wake of either [[World War I]] or [[World War II]].\n\nMonarchies established during the [[interbellum period]] were:\n*{{flagicon|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1918&ndash;1945)\n*{{flagicon|Hungary|variant=1920}} the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (1920\u20131946)\n*{{flagicon|Albania}} the [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Kingdom of Albania]] (1928\u20131944)\n\n=== Territorial evolution ===\n{|style=\"float:center; clear:left; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1714 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1789 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1799 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1815 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>1714: after [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spain's Succession]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>1789: French Revolution's eve</small>\n|align=left|<small>1799: near the Revolution's end<br /></small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1815|European states in 1815]]</small>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1914 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1930 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1950 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 2015 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1914|European states in 1914]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1930|European states in 1930]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1950|European states in 1950]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 2015|European states in 2015]]</small>\n|}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Monarchies}}\n{{Legend|#0000FF|Republics}}\n{{Legend|#008000|Ecclesiastical lands}}\n{{Legend|#9932CC|[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]}}\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===Table of monarchies in Europe===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! style=\"width:15%\" | State !!

This comparison may be hard to draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding the [[private property]] of the monarch. In the UK, the [[Crown Estate]] has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]]) by every monarch since the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1&nbsp;million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the [[Finances of the British royal family|expenses of the British royal family]] in this sense resulting in a \"negative cost\" of the British monarchy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' published an overview of the annual expenditure (excluding security expenses) of all European royal houses (not counting [[Luxembourg]] and the four monarchical [[European microstates]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

His four main conclusions were:\n* The personal salaries of presidents are lower than those of monarchs;<ref name=\"Matthijs\"/>\n* The transparency differs between republics and monarchies, and is formally regulated in republics;\n* In republics, pension costs of former heads of state are higher, although the figures don't say so;\n* The existence of subsidies to family members of the heads of state in some monarchies increases their expenses. \nHe stressed that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can know exactly what they pay for, may be unfair. In a 2015 interview with ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', Matthijs commented that the then-known \u20ac7.7&nbsp;million allotted to the royal house in Spain's national budget was 'unbelievable': \"I can't find out more, but I understand from the media that the total expenses of the Spanish house may be as much as 80 million.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/10/16/nederland-heeft-in-europa-het-duurste-vorstenhuis-1546931-a1266057 |title=Nederland heeft in Europa het duurste vorstenhuis |author= Philip de Witt Wijnen |work=NRC Handelsblad |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in France was [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished]], and in all territories the [[French First Republic]] conquered during the following [[Coalition Wars]], [[sister republic]]s were proclaimed. However, after [[Napoleon]] crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic [[Concert of Europe|European Restoration]] reaffirmed the monarchical balance of power on the continent.\n\nIn subsequent decades, republicanism would regain lost ground with the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The [[Revolutions of 1848]] were largely inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, and the remaining monarchies were transformed into [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]].\n\nRepublican movements in Europe remain active up to present. The most prominent organisations campaigning to eliminate one or more of Europe's remaining monarchies and/or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families are affiliated with the [[Alliance of European Republican Movements]], but there are smaller independent initiatives as well, such as Hetis2013 in the Netherlands.<ref>[http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ Hetis2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227161052/http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ |date=27 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0429/As-Dutch-prepare-for-new-king-republicans-ask-to-abolish-monarchy-video|title=As Dutch prepare for new king, republicans ask to abolish monarchy|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> Also, some political parties (e.g. [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain) have stepped up and called for national [[referendum|referenda]] to abolish monarchies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/spain-majority-referendum-monarchy|title=Majority in Spain want referendum on future of monarchy|first=Agence France-Presse in|last=Madrid|date=8 June 2014|website=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/06/anti-monarchy-protests-persist-spain-20146722541807612.html|title=Anti-monarchy protests persist in Spain|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Calls for restoration===\n{{further|List of current pretenders#Europe|International Monarchist League}}\nThe political influence of [[monarchism]] in former European monarchies is very limited.\n\nThere are several monarchist parties in France, most notably the ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (established 1899).\nMonarchist parties also exist [[Koruna \u010cesk\u00e1 (party)|in the Czech Republic]] (1991), [[National Hope|in Greece]] (2010), [[Monarchist Alliance|in Italy]] (1972) and [[Monarchist Party|in Russia]] (2012).\n\n[[Otto von Habsburg]] renounced all pretense to the Habsburg titles in 1958, and monarchism in Austria has next to no political influence; a German monarchist organisation called ''[[Tradition und Leben]]'' has been in existence since 1959.\n[[Monarchism in Bavaria after 1918|Monarchism in Bavaria]] has had more significant support, including [[Franz Josef Strauss]], minister-president of Bavaria from 1978&ndash;1988.\n\n[[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]] is a proponent of re-creating a [[constitutional monarchy]] in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king.

There remain, as of 2016, twelve (12) sovereign '''monarchies in Europe'''. Seven are [[Realm|kingdoms]]: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Monaco]] are [[Principality|principalities]], while Luxembourg is a [[Grand duchy|Grand Duchy]]. The [[Vatican City]] is a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] state ruled by the [[Pope]].\n\nThe monarchies can be divided into two broad classes: pre-modern states and those that gained their independence during or immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Spain, and Andorra are the sucessors to pre-modern monarchies. Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were established or gained independence through various methods during the Napoleonic Wars. The [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]] was recognized as a sovereign state administered by the [[Holy See]] in 1929. \n\nTen of these monarchies are [[Hereditary title|hereditary]], and two are elective: Vatican City (the Pope, elected at the [[papal conclave]]), and [[Andorra]] (technically a semi-elective diarchy, the joint heads of state being the elected [[President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]], appointed by the Pope).\n\nMost of the monarchies in Europe are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. The exceptions are [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]], which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and Vatican City, which is a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]]. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see [[monarchism]] and [[republicanism]]) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] in the United Kingdom). Currently six of the twelve monarchies are members of the [[European Union]]: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and [[San Marino]] were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of [[republicanism]] to the political [[mainstream]] started only at the beginning of the 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the [[Sovereign state|states]] in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected [[head of state]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|Map of [[Mycenaean Greece]].]]\nThe notion of kingship in Europe ultimately originates in systems of [[tribal kingship]] in [[prehistoric Europe]]. The [[Minoan civilisation|Minoan]] (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 1400 BCE) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in [[protohistory|protohistoric]] Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the [[Linear B]] script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about society in the Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of [[palace economy|palace economies]].<ref name=\"Blois71\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 71\u201372.</ref> The role of kings changed in the following [[Greek Dark Ages]] (c. 1100 \u2013 c. 750 BCE) to big [[gentleman farmer]]s with military power.<ref name=\"Blois71\"/>\n\n=== Archaic and classical antiquity ===\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|left|thumb|The [[Pnyx]], as [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|meeting place]] the heart of [[Athenian democracy]].]]\nSince the beginning of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was in the hands of a number of people that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (c. 750\u2013500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek [[Polis|poleis]],<ref name=\"Blois74\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 74.</ref> and [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|also in Rome]] (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility ([[aristocracy]]), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations ([[tyranny]], 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy ([[oligarchy]]) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in [[Classical Greece]] (mainly after 500 BCE).<ref name=\"Blois86\">De Blois & Van der Spek (2004), p. 86\u201387.</ref> [[Athenian democracy]] (6th century\u2013322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; [[Sparta|classical Sparta]] (c. 550\u2013371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy ([[List of kings of Sparta|dual kingship]]), aristocracy ([[Gerousia]]) and democracy ([[Apella]]);<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"geronten\".</ref> the [[Roman Republic]] (c. 509\u201327 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Romeinse Rijk. \u00a72.

Finally, Rome gradually conquered all of Italy (primarily after 350 BCE), and defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BCE). In 168, Macedon was [[Macedonian Wars|subdued by the Romans]], and partitioned into four client republics. These were annexed as Roman provinces in 148, as happened to Greece in 146,<ref name=\"Blois127\"/> making Rome's territory envelop all of literate Europe. The remainder of Iberia, the Illyrian coast and eventually [[Gaul]] by general [[Julius Caesar]] were added to the Roman Republic, which however was experiencing an institutional crisis. After defeating his rival [[Pompey]], Caesar was appointed ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' to restore order. He almost managed to found a dynasty in the process, but was killed by a republican cabal led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in 44 BCE.\n\n=== Roman Empire and legacy ===\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|The first Roman Emperor, [[Augustus]] ([[r.]] 27 BCE\u201314 CE).]]\nCaesar's adoptive son Octavian prevailed in the ensuing civil war, and converted the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BCE. He took on the name [[Augustus]], with the rather humble title of [[princeps]] (\"first [citizen]\"), as if he were merely ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\"), when he had in fact founded a monarchy. This limited emperorship ([[Principate]]) was strengthened in 284 by [[Diocletian]] to absolute reign ([[Dominate]]).<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Diocletianus, Gaius Aurelius Valerius.\"</ref> The Empire recognised various [[client kingdom]]s under imperial suzerainty; most of these were in Asia, but tribal client kings were also recognized by the Roman authorities [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|in Britannia]].

In Western Europe, the kingdom of the [[Franks]] developed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] by the 8th century, and the [[Heptarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] were unified into the [[kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. \nWith the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of [[feudalism]] places kings at the head of a pyramid of relationships between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of [[baron]]s, and the intermediate positions of [[counts]] (or [[earl]]s) and [[duke]]s. The core of European feudal [[manorialism]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] were the territories of the [[kingdom of France]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (centered on the nominal kingdoms of [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]) and the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].\n\n===Early Modern Europe===\n\n[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|European dominions of the House of Habsburg in 1700]]\nWith the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]], the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of [[James I of England]] (1603\u20131625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567\u20131625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\n[[Early modern Europe]] was dominated by the [[Wars of Religion]], notably the [[Thirty Years' War]], during which the major European monarchies developed into centralised [[great power]]s sustained by their [[colonial empire]]s.\nThe main European powers in the early modern period were:\n*the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] with its [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]]\n*the [[Portuguese Empire]] of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Iberian Union|personal union with Spain]] 1580&ndash;1640)\n*the [[Spanish Empire]] of [[Habsburg Spain]] (after 1700 [[Bourbon Spain]])\n*the [[British Empire]] of the English and Scottish [[Union of the Crowns]] (after 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]])\n*the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was increasingly dominated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and by [[Prussia]]\n*the [[Tsardom of Russia]]\n*the kingdom of Poland as the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n*the kingdom of Sweden rose to the status of great power as the comparatively short-lived [[Swedish Empire]] due to the Thirty Years' War \n*the kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]]\n\nThe [[House of Habsburg]] became the most influential royal dynasty in continental Europe by the 17th century, divided into the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] branches.\n\n===Modern Europe===\n[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|Map of Europe in 1815]]\nThe modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649, followed by the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u201383) and especially the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399). The absolutist [[Kingdom of France]] was first transformed to a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy (1791\u201392)]], before being [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fully abolished]] on 21 September 1792, and eventually the [[Execution of Louis XVI|former king even executed]], to the other European courts' great shock. During the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131799), the great European monarchies were unable to restore the monarchy; instead, the [[French First Republic]] expanded and annexed neighbouring territories, or converted them into loyal [[sister republic]]s. Meanwhile, the [[German Mediatization]] of 1803 thoroughly rearranged the political structure of the Holy Roman Empire, with many small principalities and all ecclesiastical lands being annexed by larger monarchies. After [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|Napoleon seized power]], however, he gradually constructed a new imperial order in French-controlled Europe, first by [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning himself Emperor of the French]] in 1804, and then converting the sister republics into monarchies ruled by his relatives.\n\nFollowing Napoleon's defeat in 1814 and 1815, the reactionary [[Congress of Vienna]] determined that all of Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon dynasty was restored]], replaced by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The popular [[Napoleon III]] was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the [[Second French Empire]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|\"Two Sicilies\"]]) were absorbed into the [[kingdom of Sardinia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with [[Austro-Prussian War|Prussia emerging victorious]] in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, [[Franco-Prussian War|defeat France]] and absorb the southern German states into the [[German Empire]] in the process (1870\u201371). From the ashes of the Second Empire rose the [[French Third Republic]], the only great republican European power until World War I.\n\nMuch of 19th century politics was characterised by the division between [[republicanism|anti-monarchist]] [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] [[conservatism]]. \nThe Kingdom of Spain was [[First Spanish Republic|briefly abolished]] in 1873, [[Restoration (Spain)|restored]] 1874&ndash;1931 and again [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|in 1978]].\nThe [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was abolished in 1910. The [[Russian Empire]] ended in 1917, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1918.\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] fell [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|under Habsburg rule]] in 1867 and was dissolved in 1918 ([[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|restored]] 1920\u20131946). Likewise, the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] under Habsburg rule was dissolved in 1918.\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] transformed the political landscape of Europe, and a number of modern kingdoms were formed in a resurgence of monarchism after the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]:\n\n*{{flagicon|Austria|variant=empire}} the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] (1804\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|W\u00fcrttemberg}} the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Bavaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] (1805&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1805 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Saxony}} the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (1806&ndash;1918)\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1816).svg}} the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] (1808\u20131861)\n*{{flagicon|France|variant=1814}} the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]] (1814&ndash;1848)\n*{{flagicon|Hannover}} the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814\u20131866)\n*{{flagicon|Poland|variant=1815}} the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (1815&ndash;1867/[[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|1918]])\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] (1830 to present)\n*{{flagicon|Germany|variant=empire}} the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Greece|variant=old}} the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (1832&ndash;1973)\n*{{flagicon|Italy|variant=1861}} the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861&ndash;1946)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1882\u20131947)\n*{{flagicon|Russia|variant=empire}} the [[Russian Empire]] (1721\u20131917)\n*{{flagicon|Serbia|variant=1882}} the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (1882\u20131918)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] (1908\u20131946)\nMany countries [[Abolished monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] in the 20th century and became republics, especially in the wake of either [[World War I]] or [[World War II]].\n\nMonarchies established during the [[interbellum period]] were:\n*{{flagicon|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1918&ndash;1945)\n*{{flagicon|Hungary|variant=1920}} the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (1920\u20131946)\n*{{flagicon|Albania}} the [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Kingdom of Albania]] (1928\u20131944)\n\n=== Territorial evolution ===\n{|style=\"float:center; clear:left; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1714 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1789 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1799 monarchies, republics and ecclesiastical lands.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1815 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>1714: after [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spain's Succession]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>1789: French Revolution's eve</small>\n|align=left|<small>1799: near the Revolution's end<br /></small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1815|European states in 1815]]</small>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1914 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1930 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 1950 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Europe 2015 monarchies versus republics.png|240px]]\n|-\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1914|European states in 1914]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1930|European states in 1930]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 1950|European states in 1950]]</small>\n|align=left|<small>[[List of sovereign states in 2015|European states in 2015]]</small>\n|}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Monarchies}}\n{{Legend|#0000FF|Republics}}\n{{Legend|#008000|Ecclesiastical lands}}\n{{Legend|#9932CC|[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]}}\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===Table of monarchies in Europe===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! style=\"width:15%\" | State !!

This comparison may be hard to draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding the [[private property]] of the monarch. In the UK, the [[Crown Estate]] has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]]) by every monarch since the accession of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1&nbsp;million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the [[Finances of the British royal family|expenses of the British royal family]] in this sense resulting in a \"negative cost\" of the British monarchy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' published an overview of the annual expenditure (excluding security expenses) of all European royal houses (not counting [[Luxembourg]] and the four monarchical [[European microstates]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

His four main conclusions were:\n* The personal salaries of presidents are lower than those of monarchs;<ref name=\"Matthijs\"/>\n* The transparency differs between republics and monarchies, and is formally regulated in republics;\n* In republics, pension costs of former heads of state are higher, although the figures don't say so;\n* The existence of subsidies to family members of the heads of state in some monarchies increases their expenses. \nHe stressed that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can know exactly what they pay for, may be unfair. In a 2015 interview with ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', Matthijs commented that the then-known \u20ac7.7&nbsp;million allotted to the royal house in Spain's national budget was 'unbelievable': \"I can't find out more, but I understand from the media that the total expenses of the Spanish house may be as much as 80 million.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/10/16/nederland-heeft-in-europa-het-duurste-vorstenhuis-1546931-a1266057 |title=Nederland heeft in Europa het duurste vorstenhuis |author= Philip de Witt Wijnen |work=NRC Handelsblad |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] in France was [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished]], and in all territories the [[French First Republic]] conquered during the following [[Coalition Wars]], [[sister republic]]s were proclaimed. However, after [[Napoleon]] crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic [[Concert of Europe|European Restoration]] reaffirmed the monarchical balance of power on the continent.\n\nIn subsequent decades, republicanism would regain lost ground with the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The [[Revolutions of 1848]] were largely inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, and the remaining monarchies were transformed into [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]].\n\nRepublican movements in Europe remain active up to present. The most prominent organisations campaigning to eliminate one or more of Europe's remaining monarchies and/or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families are affiliated with the [[Alliance of European Republican Movements]], but there are smaller independent initiatives as well, such as Hetis2013 in the Netherlands.<ref>[http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ Hetis2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227161052/http://hetis2013.nl/achtergrond/ |date=27 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0429/As-Dutch-prepare-for-new-king-republicans-ask-to-abolish-monarchy-video|title=As Dutch prepare for new king, republicans ask to abolish monarchy|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> Also, some political parties (e.g. [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain) have stepped up and called for national [[referendum|referenda]] to abolish monarchies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/spain-majority-referendum-monarchy|title=Majority in Spain want referendum on future of monarchy|first=Agence France-Presse in|last=Madrid|date=8 June 2014|website=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/06/anti-monarchy-protests-persist-spain-20146722541807612.html|title=Anti-monarchy protests persist in Spain|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Calls for restoration===\n{{further|List of current pretenders#Europe|International Monarchist League}}\nThe political influence of [[monarchism]] in former European monarchies is very limited.\n\nThere are several monarchist parties in France, most notably the ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (established 1899).\nMonarchist parties also exist [[Koruna \u010cesk\u00e1 (party)|in the Czech Republic]] (1991), [[National Hope|in Greece]] (2010), [[Monarchist Alliance|in Italy]] (1972) and [[Monarchist Party|in Russia]] (2012).\n\n[[Otto von Habsburg]] renounced all pretense to the Habsburg titles in 1958, and monarchism in Austria has next to no political influence; a German monarchist organisation called ''[[Tradition und Leben]]'' has been in existence since 1959.\n[[Monarchism in Bavaria after 1918|Monarchism in Bavaria]] has had more significant support, including [[Franz Josef Strauss]], minister-president of Bavaria from 1978&ndash;1988.\n\n[[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]] is a proponent of re-creating a [[constitutional monarchy]] in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king.
