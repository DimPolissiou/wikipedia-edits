In general, however, during the 20th century it enjoyed one of the highest GDP growth rates in the world<ref name=\"Angus Maddison\">[[Angus Maddison]], [http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/Monitoring.shtml \"Monitoring the World Economy 1820-1992\"], OECD (1995)</ref> (for a quarter century \u2013 early 1950s to mid 1970s \u2013 [[Greek economic miracle|second in the world after Japan]]). Average Greek government debt-to-GDP for the entire century before the crisis (1909\u20132008) was lower than that for the UK, Canada or France<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/><ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/> (see table), while for the 30-year period (1952\u20131981) until its entrance into the [[European Economic Community]], the Greek government debt-to-GDP ratio averaged only 19.8%.<ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1993 it steadily rose, surpassing the average of what is today the Eurozone in the mid-1980s (see chart below). For the next 15 years, from 1993 to 2007 (i.e. before the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]), Greece's government debt-to-GDP ratio remained roughly unchanged (the value was not affected by the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]]), averaging 102%<ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/><ref name=\"Debt 1980\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economicsinpictures.com/2011/09/greek-debtgdp-only-22-in-1980.html|title= Greek Debt/GDP: Only 22% In 1980|work= Economics in Pictures |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\u2013 a value lower than that for Italy (107%) and Belgium (110%) during the same 15-year period,<ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/> and comparable to that for the U.S. or the OECD average in 2017.<ref name=\"OECD Debt\">{{cite news |url= https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp|title= Debt-To-GDP Ratio\n|work= Investopedia (2018) |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the latter period, the country's annual budget deficit usually exceeded 3% of GDP, but its effect on the debt-to GDP ratio was counterbalanced by high GDP growth rates.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> The debt-to GDP values for 2006 and 2007 (about 105%) were established after [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|audits]] resulted in corrections according to Eurostat methodology, of up to 10 percentage points for the particular years (as well as similar corrections for the years 2008 and 2009). These corrections, although altering the debt level by [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|a maximum of about 10%]], resulted in a popular notion that \"Greece was previously hiding its debt\".\n\n=== Evolutions after Eurozone entry ===\nThe 2001 introduction of the euro reduced trade costs between Eurozone countries, increasing overall trade volume. Labour costs increased more (from a lower base) in peripheral countries such as Greece relative to core countries such as Germany without compensating rise in productivity, eroding Greece's competitive edge. As a result, Greece's [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account (trade) deficit]] rose significantly.<ref name=FRBSFGalina>{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/january/balance-payments-europe-periphery/|title=Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco \u2013 Research, Economic Research, Europe, Balance of Payments, European Periphery|date=14 January 2013|work=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nA trade deficit means that a country is consuming more than it produces, which requires borrowing/direct investment from other countries.<ref name=FRBSFGalina /> Both the Greek [[trade deficit]] and [[budget deficit]] rose from below 5% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP in the 2008\u20132009 periods.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=244979&updated=4652|title=FRED Graph|work=stlouisfed.org|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> One driver of the investment inflow was Greece's membership in the EU and the Eurozone. Greece was perceived as a higher [[credit risk]] alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone, which implied that investors felt the EU would bring discipline to its finances and support Greece in the event of problems.<ref name=\"vox.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts|title=Greece's debt crisis explained in charts and maps|author=Ezra Klein|work=Vox|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Great Recession]] spread to Europe, the amount of funds lent from the European [[core countries]] (e.g. Germany) to the peripheral countries such as Greece began to decline. Reports in 2009 of Greek fiscal mismanagement and deception increased [[Interest expense|borrowing costs]]; the combination meant Greece could no longer borrow to finance its [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s at an affordable cost.<ref name=FRBSFGalina />\n\nA country facing a '[[Sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]]' in private investment and a high (local currency) [[government debt|debt]] load typically allows its currency to [[currency depreciation|depreciate]] to encourage investment and to pay back the debt in devalued currency. This was not possible while Greece remained in the Euro.<ref name=FRBSFGalina />  \"However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits\".<ref name=FRBSFGalina />  In addition, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} a form of [[deflation]]. This significantly reduced income and GDP, resulting in a severe [[economic recession|recession]], decline in tax receipts and a significant rise in the [[debt ratio|debt-to-GDP ratio]]. Unemployment reached nearly 25%, from below 10% in 2003. Significant government spending cuts helped the Greek government return to a primary [[budget surplus]] by 2014 (collecting more [[government revenue|revenue]] than it paid out, excluding [[compound interest|interest]]).<ref name=AKPrimer>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf |first=Anil |last=Kashyap |title=A Primer on the Greek Crisis |date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n=== External factors ===\nThe Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the [[Great Recession]], which lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> What was exceptional for Greece, was that the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was simultaneously coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP- as calculated after all corrections <ref name=\"Debt Past\"/>). Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat\"/> In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]] (the latter has been cited <ref name=\"Euro effect 1\"/><ref name=\"Euro effect 2\"/> as a possible key factor).\n\nFinally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which lead to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|about 10%]], i.e., a public debt to GDP of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was \"punished\" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.\n\n=== Internal factors ===\nIn January 2010, the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Finance]] published ''Stability and Growth Program 2010''.<ref name=europa1>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/pdf/20_scps/2009-10/01_programme/el_2010-01-15_sp_en.pdf|title=Update of the Hellenic Stability and Growth Programme|work=Greek Ministry of Finance|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> The report listed five main causes, poor GDP growth, government debt and deficits, budget compliance and data credibility. Causes found by others included excess government spending, current account deficits, [[tax avoidance]] and [[tax evasion]].<ref name=europa1 />\n\n==== GDP growth ====\nAfter 2008, GDP growth was lower than the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority|Greek national statistical agency]] had anticipated. The Greek Ministry of Finance reported the need to improve competitiveness by reducing salaries and bureaucracy<ref name=\"europa1\" /> and to redirect governmental spending from non-growth sectors such as the military into growth-stimulating sectors.\n\nThe global financial crisis had a particularly large negative impact on GDP growth rates in Greece. Two of the country's largest earners, tourism and shipping were badly affected by the downturn, with revenues falling 15% in 2009.<ref name=\"tempsreel.nouvelobs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20100505.OBS3509/onze-questions-reponses-sur-la-crise-grecque.html|title=Onze questions-r\u00e9ponses sur la crise grecque|date=5 May 2010|publisher=Nouvelobs.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Government deficit ====\nFiscal imbalances developed from 2004 to 2009: \"output increased in nominal terms by 40%, while central government primary expenditures increased by 87% against an increase of only 31% in tax revenues.\" The Ministry intended to implement real expenditure cuts that would allow expenditures to grow 3.8% from 2009 to 2013, well below expected inflation at 6.9%. Overall revenues were expected to grow 31.5% from 2009 to 2013, secured by new, higher taxes and by a major reform of the ineffective tax collection system. The deficit needed to decline to a level compatible with a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\n==== Government debt ====\nThe debt increased in 2009 due to the higher-than-expected government deficit and higher debt-service costs. The Greek government assessed that structural economic reforms would be insufficient, as the debt would still increase to an unsustainable level before the positive results of reforms could be achieved. In addition to structural reforms, permanent and temporary [[austerity measures]] (with a size relative to GDP of 4.0% in 2010, 3.1% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012 and 0.8% in 2013) were needed. Reforms and austerity measures, in combination with an expected return of positive economic growth in 2011, would reduce the baseline deficit from \u20ac30.6 billion in 2009 to \u20ac5.7 billion in 2013, while the debt/GDP ratio would stabilize at 120% in 2010\u20132011 and decline in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAfter 1993, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained above 94%.<ref name=\"Debt-to-GDP ratio\" /> The [[late-2000s financial crisis|crisis]] caused the debt level to exceed the maximum sustainable level (defined by [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] economists to be 120%). According to the report \"The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece\" published by the EU Commission in October 2011, the debt level was expected to reach 198% in 2012, if the proposed debt restructure agreement was not implemented.<ref name=\"EC draft\">{{cite web|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|title=The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece: Fifth Review&nbsp;\u2013 October 2011 (Draft)|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=22 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120193113/http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Budget compliance ====\nBudget compliance was acknowledged to need improvement. For 2009 it was found to be \"a lot worse than normal, due to economic control being more lax in a year with political elections\". The government wanted to strengthen the monitoring system in 2010, making it possible to track revenues and expenses, at both national and local levels.\n\n==== Data credibility ====\nProblems with unreliable data had existed since Greece applied for Euro membership in 1999.<ref name=\"Eurostat Audit in 2004 of the Greek economy\">{{cite web |title=Revision of the Greek Government Deficit and Debt Figures |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF |publisher=Eurostat |date=22 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205001847/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the five years from 2005 to 2009, [[Eurostat]] noted reservations about Greek fiscal data in five semiannual assessments of the quality of EU member states' public finance statistics.

These most recent revisions are an illustration of the lack of quality of the Greek fiscal statistics (and of macroeconomic statistics in general) and show that the progress in the compilation of fiscal statistics in Greece, and the intense scrutiny of the Greek fiscal data by Eurostat since 2004 (including 10 EDP visits and 5 reservations on the notified data), have not sufficed to bring the quality of Greek fiscal data to the level reached by other EU Member States.\" And the same report further noted (page 7): \"The partners in the ESS [European Statistical System] are supposed to cooperate in good faith.

In 2011 it gave rise to the anti-austerity [[Anti-austerity_movement_in_Greece|Movement of the Indignant]] in Syntagma Square. The [[two-party system]] which dominated Greek politics from 1977 to 2009 crumbled in the double elections of [[May_2012_Greek_legislative_election|6 May]] and [[June_2012_Greek_legislative_election|17 June 2012]]. The main features of this transformation were: \n\na) The crisis of the two main parties, the center-right [[New_Democracy_(Greece)|New Democracy (ND)]] and center-left [[PASOK]]. ND saw its share of the vote drop from an historical average of >40% to a record low of 19%-33% in 2009\u201319. PASOK collapsed from 44% in 2009 to 13% in [[June_2012_Greek_legislative_election|June 2012]] and stabilized around 8% in the 2019 elections. Meanwhile, [[Syriza]] emerged as the main rival of ND, with a share of the vote that rose from 4% to 27% between 2009 and June 2012. This peaked in the elections of [[January_2015_Greek_legislative_election|25 January 2015]] when Syriza received 36% of the vote and fell to 31.5% in the [[2019_Greek_legislative_election|7 July 2019 elections]].  \n\nb) The sharp rise of the Neo-Nazi [[Golden_Dawn_(political_party)|Golden Dawn]], whose share of the vote increased from 0.5% in 2009 to 7% in May and June 2012.

For the next 15 years, from 1993 to 2007 (i.e. before the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]), Greece's government debt-to-GDP ratio remained roughly unchanged (the value was not affected by the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]]), averaging 102%<ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/><ref name=\"Debt 1980\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economicsinpictures.com/2011/09/greek-debtgdp-only-22-in-1980.html|title= Greek Debt/GDP: Only 22% In 1980|work= Economics in Pictures |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\u2013 a value lower than that for Italy (107%) and Belgium (110%) during the same 15-year period,<ref name=\"Historical Debt IMF\"/> and comparable to that for the U.S. or the OECD average in 2017.<ref name=\"OECD Debt\">{{cite news |url= https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp|title= Debt-To-GDP Ratio\n|work= Investopedia (2018) |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the latter period, the country's annual budget deficit usually exceeded 3% of GDP, but its effect on the debt-to GDP ratio was counterbalanced by high GDP growth rates.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> The debt-to GDP values for 2006 and 2007 (about 105%) were established after [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|audits]] resulted in corrections according to Eurostat methodology, of up to 10 percentage points for the particular years (as well as similar corrections for the years 2008 and 2009). These corrections, although altering the debt level by [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|a maximum of about 10%]], resulted in a popular notion that \"Greece was previously hiding its debt\".\n\n=== Evolutions after Eurozone entry ===\nThe 2001 introduction of the euro reduced trade costs between Eurozone countries, increasing overall trade volume. Labour costs increased more (from a lower base) in peripheral countries such as Greece relative to core countries such as Germany without compensating rise in productivity, eroding Greece's competitive edge. As a result, Greece's [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account (trade) deficit]] rose significantly.<ref name=FRBSFGalina>{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/january/balance-payments-europe-periphery/|title=Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco \u2013 Research, Economic Research, Europe, Balance of Payments, European Periphery|date=14 January 2013|work=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nA trade deficit means that a country is consuming more than it produces, which requires borrowing/direct investment from other countries.<ref name=FRBSFGalina /> Both the Greek [[trade deficit]] and [[budget deficit]] rose from below 5% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP in the 2008\u20132009 periods.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=244979&updated=4652|title=FRED Graph|work=stlouisfed.org|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> One driver of the investment inflow was Greece's membership in the EU and the Eurozone. Greece was perceived as a higher [[credit risk]] alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone, which implied that investors felt the EU would bring discipline to its finances and support Greece in the event of problems.<ref name=\"vox.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts|title=Greece's debt crisis explained in charts and maps|author=Ezra Klein|work=Vox|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Great Recession]] spread to Europe, the amount of funds lent from the European [[core countries]] (e.g. Germany) to the peripheral countries such as Greece began to decline.

This was not possible while Greece remained in the Euro.<ref name=FRBSFGalina />  \"However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits\".<ref name=FRBSFGalina />  In addition, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} a form of [[deflation]]. This significantly reduced income and GDP, resulting in a severe [[economic recession|recession]], decline in tax receipts and a significant rise in the [[debt ratio|debt-to-GDP ratio]]. Unemployment reached nearly 25%, from below 10% in 2003. Significant government spending cuts helped the Greek government return to a primary [[budget surplus]] by 2014 (collecting more [[government revenue|revenue]] than it paid out, excluding [[compound interest|interest]]).<ref name=AKPrimer>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf |first=Anil |last=Kashyap |title=A Primer on the Greek Crisis |date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n=== External factors ===\nThe Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the [[Great Recession]], which lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> What was exceptional for Greece, was that the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was simultaneously coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP- as calculated after all corrections <ref name=\"Debt Past\"/>). Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat\"/> In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]] (the latter has been cited <ref name=\"Euro effect 1\"/><ref name=\"Euro effect 2\"/> as a possible key factor).\n\nFinally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which lead to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009\u201310|about 10%]], i.e., a public debt to GDP of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was \"punished\" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.\n\n=== Internal factors ===\nIn January 2010, the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Finance]] published ''Stability and Growth Program 2010''.<ref name=europa1>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/pdf/20_scps/2009-10/01_programme/el_2010-01-15_sp_en.pdf|title=Update of the Hellenic Stability and Growth Programme|work=Greek Ministry of Finance|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> The report listed five main causes, poor GDP growth, government debt and deficits, budget compliance and data credibility.

The Greek Ministry of Finance reported the need to improve competitiveness by reducing salaries and bureaucracy<ref name=\"europa1\" /> and to redirect governmental spending from non-growth sectors such as the military into growth-stimulating sectors.\n\nThe global financial crisis had a particularly large negative impact on GDP growth rates in Greece. Two of the country's largest earners, tourism and shipping were badly affected by the downturn, with revenues falling 15% in 2009.<ref name=\"tempsreel.nouvelobs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20100505.OBS3509/onze-questions-reponses-sur-la-crise-grecque.html|title=Onze questions-r\u00e9ponses sur la crise grecque|date=5 May 2010|publisher=Nouvelobs.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Government deficit ====\nFiscal imbalances developed from 2004 to 2009: \"output increased in nominal terms by 40%, while central government primary expenditures increased by 87% against an increase of only 31% in tax revenues.\" The Ministry intended to implement real expenditure cuts that would allow expenditures to grow 3.8% from 2009 to 2013, well below expected inflation at 6.9%. Overall revenues were expected to grow 31.5% from 2009 to 2013, secured by new, higher taxes and by a major reform of the ineffective tax collection system. The deficit needed to decline to a level compatible with a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\n==== Government debt ====\nThe debt increased in 2009 due to the higher-than-expected government deficit and higher debt-service costs. The Greek government assessed that structural economic reforms would be insufficient, as the debt would still increase to an unsustainable level before the positive results of reforms could be achieved. In addition to structural reforms, permanent and temporary [[austerity measures]] (with a size relative to GDP of 4.0% in 2010, 3.1% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012 and 0.8% in 2013) were needed. Reforms and austerity measures, in combination with an expected return of positive economic growth in 2011, would reduce the baseline deficit from \u20ac30.6 billion in 2009 to \u20ac5.7 billion in 2013, while the debt/GDP ratio would stabilize at 120% in 2010\u20132011 and decline in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAfter 1993, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained above 94%.<ref name=\"Debt-to-GDP ratio\" /> The [[late-2000s financial crisis|crisis]] caused the debt level to exceed the maximum sustainable level (defined by [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] economists to be 120%). According to the report \"The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece\" published by the EU Commission in October 2011, the debt level was expected to reach 198% in 2012, if the proposed debt restructure agreement was not implemented.<ref name=\"EC draft\">{{cite web|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|title=The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece: Fifth Review&nbsp;\u2013 October 2011 (Draft)|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=22 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120193113/http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Budget compliance ====\nBudget compliance was acknowledged to need improvement. For 2009 it was found to be \"a lot worse than normal, due to economic control being more lax in a year with political elections\".

As the inflow of money stopped during the crisis, reducing the foreign financial surplus, Greece was forced to reduce its budget deficit substantially.

In 2011 it gave rise to the anti-austerity [[Anti-austerity_movement_in_Greece|Movement of the Indignant]] in Syntagma Square. The [[two-party system]] which dominated Greek politics from 1977 to 2009 crumbled in the double elections of [[May_2012_Greek_legislative_election|6 May]] and [[June_2012_Greek_legislative_election|17 June 2012]]. The main features of this transformation were: \n\na) The crisis of the two main parties, the center-right [[New_Democracy_(Greece)|New Democracy (ND)]] and center-left [[PASOK]]. ND saw its share of the vote drop from an historical average of >40% to a record low of 19%-33% in 2009\u201319. PASOK collapsed from 44% in 2009 to 13% in [[June_2012_Greek_legislative_election|June 2012]] and stabilized around 8% in the 2019 elections. Meanwhile, [[Syriza]] emerged as the main rival of ND, with a share of the vote that rose from 4% to 27% between 2009 and June 2012. This peaked in the elections of [[January_2015_Greek_legislative_election|25 January 2015]] when Syriza received 36% of the vote and fell to 31.5% in the [[2019_Greek_legislative_election|7 July 2019 elections]].  \n\nb) The sharp rise of the Neo-Nazi [[Golden_Dawn_(political_party)|Golden Dawn]], whose share of the vote increased from 0.5% in 2009 to 7% in May and June 2012.

Eventually, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and Kim worked out a deal and brought on [[David Shore]], creator of the Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', to develop the series.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |title=How ABC Found a surprise Hit in 'The Good Doctor' |last=Koblin |first=John |date=November 19, 2017 |access-date=December 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015955/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe show is produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], in association with production companies Shore Z Productions, [[3AD]], and Entermedia.

The actor [[Daniel Dae Kim]] first noticed the series and bought the rights for his production company. He began adapting the series and in 2015 eventually shopped it to CBS, his home network. CBS decided against creating a pilot. Because Kim felt so strongly about the series, he bought back the rights from CBS. Eventually, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and Kim worked out a deal and brought on [[David Shore]], creator of the Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', to develop the series.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |title=How ABC Found a surprise Hit in 'The Good Doctor' |last=Koblin |first=John |date=November 19, 2017 |access-date=December 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015955/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe show is produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], in association with production companies Shore Z Productions, [[3AD]], and Entermedia.

{"title_page": "List of chess grandmasters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of chess grandmasters'''. The title of [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM) is awarded to world-class [[chess]] players by the sport's governing body [[FIDE]]. It is the highest title a chess player can attain and is awarded for life, although FIDE regulations allow for the revocation of titles for cheating or fraud.  FIDE has awarded a total of {{table row counter|id=grandmasters|ignore=1}} grandmaster titles, not counting the three GM titles that have been revoked.\n\n{{Compact ToC|pre1=Grandmasters|custom1=Revoked titles|notesfirst=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n==Grandmasters==\nThe July 2019 FIDE rating list includes 1680 grandmasters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ratings.fide.com/advaction.phtml?idcode=&title=g |title=Advanced search results |publisher=FIDE}}</ref> of which 1643 are male and 37<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ratings.fide.com/advaction.phtml?title=g&sex=f |title=Advanced search results |publisher=FIDE}} (female search)</ref> are [[List of female chess players#Grandmasters|female]].  These figures are approximate as the FIDE list may include a few deceased players, and may also exclude players from the list for various reasons.  There is also a [[FIDE titles#Woman Grandmaster (WGM)|Woman Grandmaster]] title with lower requirements awarded only to women. This list includes only those women who have achieved the Grandmaster title proper.\n\nFIDE has issued ID codes since 1998; some older grandmasters were never assigned an ID.  For living grandmasters, FIDE ID is a link to the FIDE chess profile page.  The FIDE Chess Profile page can usually be used to verify the year the GM title was awarded and the player's birth year.  FIDE IDs for deceased grandmasters are retained in this table to aid matching with older FIDE records such as the FIDE rating lists.  The Notes column briefly describes the source or sources for the entry and may include a link to [[wikidata]].\n\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: When adding players to the list, use a piped link to display name in \"Surname, Given name\" order and be sure to add the name in the correct place in the list -->\n<!--With the exception of Anand's and Sasikiran's names which are given in their common Westernized forms, the ordering of Tamil names follows that given by the website of the Tamil Nadu State Chess Association at http://www.tamilchess.com/TnGm_Im.aspx, and the use of initials in Tamil names follows the FIDE website.-->\n<!-- the nowrap on Agzamov will set the Born and Died column widths sufficient to not wrap these dates (Agzamov was picked as the first GM with a date of death) -->\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" id=\"grandmasters\"\n!

The title of [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM) is awarded to world-class [[chess]] players by the sport's governing body [[FIDE]]. It is the highest title a chess player can attain and is awarded for life, although FIDE regulations allow for the revocation of titles for cheating or fraud.  FIDE has awarded a total of {{table row counter|id=grandmasters|ignore=1}} grandmaster titles, not counting the three GM titles that have been revoked.\n\n{{Compact ToC|pre1=Grandmasters|custom1=Revoked titles|notesfirst=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n==Grandmasters==\nThe July 2019 FIDE rating list includes 1680 grandmasters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ratings.fide.com/advaction.phtml?idcode=&title=g |title=Advanced search results |publisher=FIDE}}</ref> of which 1643 are male and 37<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ratings.fide.com/advaction.phtml?title=g&sex=f |title=Advanced search results |publisher=FIDE}} (female search)</ref> are [[List of female chess players#Grandmasters|female]].  These figures are approximate as the FIDE list may include a few deceased players, and may also exclude players from the list for various reasons.  There is also a [[FIDE titles#Woman Grandmaster (WGM)|Woman Grandmaster]] title with lower requirements awarded only to women. This list includes only those women who have achieved the Grandmaster title proper.\n\nFIDE has issued ID codes since 1998; some older grandmasters were never assigned an ID.  For living grandmasters, FIDE ID is a link to the FIDE chess profile page.  The FIDE Chess Profile page can usually be used to verify the year the GM title was awarded and the player's birth year.  FIDE IDs for deceased grandmasters are retained in this table to aid matching with older FIDE records such as the FIDE rating lists.  The Notes column briefly describes the source or sources for the entry and may include a link to [[wikidata]].\n\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: When adding players to the list, use a piped link to display name in \"Surname, Given name\" order and be sure to add the name in the correct place in the list -->\n<!--With the exception of Anand's and Sasikiran's names which are given in their common Westernized forms, the ordering of Tamil names follows that given by the website of the Tamil Nadu State Chess Association at http://www.tamilchess.com/TnGm_Im.aspx, and the use of initials in Tamil names follows the FIDE website.-->\n<!-- the nowrap on Agzamov will set the Born and Died column widths sufficient to not wrap these dates (Agzamov was picked as the first GM with a date of death) -->\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" id=\"grandmasters\"\n!
