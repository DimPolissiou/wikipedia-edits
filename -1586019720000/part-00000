{"title_page": "Black Lace", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Black Lace''' are a British pop band, best known for [[novelty song|novelty]] party records, including their biggest hit, \"[[Agadoo]]\". The band first came to the public eye after being selected to represent the UK in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Eurovision Song Contest]], in which they finished seventh with the song [[Mary Ann (Black Lace song)|\"Mary Ann\"]]. With numerous line-up changes (the only original member being Colin Gibb) Black Lace went on to have success with novelty party anthems such as \"[[Superman (Black Lace song)|Superman]]\" and \"Do the Conga\".\n\nToday, 'Black Lace' consist of two working bands; The 'Full time' international band (officially known as: 'The Original Black lace') featuring original member Colin Gibb, who has taken the band around the world playing the party show throughout Europe, the Middle East, Australia, Canada and the US. Also: the 'UK' based, part time band, featuring 'ex member' Dene Michael (aka 'Black Lace Conga party')\n\n== Pre-Black Lace (1973\u20131975) ==\n[[Terry Dobson (singer)|Terry Dobson]] and school friend Ian Howarth formed The Impact, as a five-piece pop group in 1969, with [[Alan Barton]], Steve Scholey and Nigel Scott. The group also performed under the names Penny Arcade and Love or Confusion.\n\nHowarth left the band for a short while but returned to the line-up in 1974, and Dobson also left to be replaced briefly by Neil Hardcastle. Dobson then re-joined and Scott left in 1975; that same year the band adopted the name Black Lace. Howarth left the band for good in 1976, and was replaced by Colin Gibb (born Colin Routh, 8 December 1953).<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p477088/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography by Sharon Mawer|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Black Lace (1976\u20131981) ==\nAfter turning professional at the beginning of 1976, the band toured the majority of the UK, managed by Keith Mills, commencing their first summer season at the Skegness Bier Garten. The following year their summer season would take them to [[Butlin's Filey|Butlins in Filey, North Yorkshire]] and [[Butlins Skegness|Skegness, Lincolnshire]]. An [[Extended play|EP]] was recorded and produced by comedian Freddie 'Parrotface' Davis at his studio, which was to be sold at their shows. The group were voted Yorkshire Band of the Year by [[BBC Radio Leeds]], and best clubland group playing at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool]].\n\nIn 1979, Black Lace recorded their first single, \"Mary Ann\", for [[ATV Music|ATV]] music and a recording contract followed with [[EMI]]. As the song required a more 'throaty' vocal, Alan Barton was switched to being lead singer, with Steve Scholey moving to backing vocals for the band's recordings, but remained as lead singer on live performances.  The song won the [[BBC Television]]'s [[Eurovision: Your Country Needs You|''A Song For Europe'']]. Other television appearances around this time included ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'', ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Juke Box Jury]]''. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in Israel, the band finished seventh and \"Mary Ann\" reached No. 42 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=60}}</ref>\n\nThe band's follow-up single, \"So Long Suzy Baby\", failed to chart in the UK (as EMI couldn't decide on which track should be used and delayed on the planned release date), but achieved success in Europe. Black Lace found great success with live performances and TV shows, notably in Poland and Bulgaria, and on TV in East Germany, West Germany and Spain.\n\nThe band toured Denmark in 1980, supporting [[Suzi Quatro]] and working with [[Tommy Seebach]], a Danish entertainer. Black Lace and Seebach recorded \"Hey Hey Jock McRay\" for the Danish singles market, but an intended 1980 tour of Poland was called off because of political unrest in the country.\n\n==Chart success (1981\u20131987)==\nIn 1981, the band split. Dobson joined the Castleford rock band Stormer who had a recording contract with [[Ringo Starr]]. Scholey departed, leaving the others to settle huge debts incurred whilst touring. The band became a duo of Gibb and Barton.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It was this line-up that would give the band its biggest [[Record chart|chart]] success.\n\nThe duo played the Northern club circuit using pre-recorded backing tracks, which was controversial at the time. Initially they used the name 'Lace' but soon reverted to 'Black Lace' and recruited a new manager, John Wagstaff. They recorded an instrumental single based on the \"[[Chicken Dance]]\", released as \"Birds Dance\" in 1981 (using the name 'Busby' instead of Black lace).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wired for Sound: Now That's What I Call An Eighties Music Childhood|last=Bromley|first=Tom|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2012|isbn=9780857203236}}</ref> However, the record was beaten to the charts by another version of the song by The Tweets released as \"The Birdie Song\". \"Birds Dance\" has since been retitled \"The Birdie Song\" and included on Black Lace albums.\n\nBlack Lace's 1983 \"Superman\" single was their first one under their own name on the Flair label,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and a promotional [[Music video|video]] was shot at Casanova's [[nightclub]] in Wakefield. One of the hired dancers was the then unknown singer [[Jane McDonald]]. \"Superman\" reached No. 9 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> but an attempt at a follow-up single \"Hey You!\" failed to chart despite being [[BBC Radio One]]'s 'Record of the Week'. Black Lace received a [[Music recording sales certification|silver disc]] for sales of \"Superman\". They proceeded to tour Denmark with Danish stars '[[Laban (artist)|Laban]]' and 'Snapshots'\n\nThe band's biggest success came in 1984 with the single \"[[Agadoo]]\", selling over one million copies worldwide and reaching No. 2 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \"Agadoo\" was a hit in Europe, South Africa and Australia. Having been presented with a gold disc for sales in the UK. In a radio interview, presenter, Richard Whiteley forgets Gibb's name and refers to him as 'Mr Agadoo' (the name, Dean Michaels latter adopts for himself, although having no connection with the actual record) The duo recorded their first album ''Black Lace'' at Stuck Ranch studios in Denmark. Around this time their record distribution company 'Pinicle' went into receivership, leading to Black Lace and their record company losing an estimated quarter of a million pounds in unpaid [[royalties]] for \"Agadoo\".\n\nThe band's follow-up single, \"Do The Conga\", reached No. 10 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> and the accompanying album ''Party Party \u2013 16 Great Party Icebreakers'' sold over 650,000 copies in the first five weeks, reaching double platinum status and leading to the band doing TV shows in Germany, Luxembourg, France and Denmark.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1985 another single, \"El Vino Collapso\", was released, with the video shot in Skegness. It failed to reach the top 40, stalling at No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart due to it being 'banned' by the BBC in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], as it had references to \"drinking whilst abroad\" and deemed unsuitable for radio play.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Further releases \"I Speaka Da Lingo\" and \"Hokey Cokey\" reached No. 49 and No. 31, respectively.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nBlack Lace also participated in the recording of the UK No. 1 hit \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\" as part of the charity ensemble, [[The Crowd (band)|The Crowd]] (which included members of [[10cc]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[The Hollies]], [[Argent (band)|Argent]], [[The Who]], [[The Nolans]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[Smokie (band)|Smokey]], [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]], plus many more) to raise funds for the families of the victims of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 2\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=128}}</ref>\n\nBlack Lace's second album ''Party Party 2'' was released for Christmas 1985, and television appearances included a Black Lace special on the [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] rock show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', plus  ''[[3-2-1]]'', ''[[ITV Telethon]]'', ''Miss Yorkshire Television'', ''International Disco Dance Championship'', ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'', and ''Top of the Pops'' Christmas Special. Because of such a demanding work schedule, Barton and Gibb found it necessary to charter a private aircraft to meet the deadlines, but the band's success led to a tax demand in excess of \u00a3100,000.\n\nIn 1986, Dene Michael replaced Gibb, who took time out of live work with Black Lace (remaining an official member of the band) to concentrate on other projects including: promoting pop act 'Party Party' and participating in two tours of Germany, concentrating on a part time photography business, setting up a food retail outlet, and a music equipment retail and installation business. \n\nAnother single, \"Wig Wam Bam\", (featuring Barton, Gibb and Michael) reached No. 63 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> but \"Viva La Mexico\", which was released to capitalise on the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] football competition, flopped when [[England national football team|England]] was knocked out. Black Lace (Barton and Michael) appeared as themselves in the filming of the 1987 film ''[[Rita, Sue and Bob Too]]'', which featured \"Gang Bang\" and \"Have a Screw\", which had been recorded by Barton and Gibb the previous year. The pair (Barton/Michael) where also immortalised as caricatures in the TV show '[[Spitting Image]]' and the hit single '[[The Chicken Song]]'. The band had a UK hit with their album ''Party Crazy''.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\n==Later career 1987\u2013present)==\nSeptember 1987 saw a switch round, Gibb returned \u2018full time\u2019 with the band whilst Barton left to join Smokie.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Michael became a full-time member of Black Lace and he and Gibb released the single \"Jammin' the Sixties\" under the name Barracuda. The record was BBC Radio One's Record of the Week, but failed to chart. Summer seasons at the [[Blackpool Tower]] followed in 1989 and 1990, plus performances at the 'BBC Radio One Roadshow' in the town, along with the release of the single \"I Am The Music Man\" which peaked at No. 52 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /><ref name=\"AMG\" />\nIn 1991, due to personal issues, Michael was forced to leave the band to be replaced by Rob Hopcraft. The pair released the single \"Penny Arcade\", penned by close friend Sammy King, which had originally been a hit for [[Roy Orbison]] in 1979. The band appeared on the BBC's ''[[Children in Need]]'' programme. Under an agreement with Gibb and Wagstaf, not to use the 'Black lace' name, Michael forms new band and uses the name \u2018'Barracuda'\u2019 but shortly disband.\n1992 Black Lace toured Australia, but Hopcraft was unhappy with a hits album released by an Australian record company as it featured a photograph of his predecessor Dene Michael.\n\n1994 saw the release of the single \"Bullshit (Cotton Eyed Joe)\", but the race for the charts was won by the Swedish band [[Rednex]] with another version of the same song. An album, ''Saturday Night'', followed.\n\nIn 1995, Barton died as a result of a coach crash in Germany while touring with Smokie.<ref>{{cite news|author=Pierre Perrone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alan-barton-1616108.html|title=Obituary: Alan Barton|work=The Independent|date=18 April 1995|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Also in that year Black Lace shot a promotional video for the single \"Electric Slide\" in [[Benidorm]], the first video not to be filmed in the UK, and played on British breakfast station [[GMTV]] live from [[Torremolinos]] in Spain.\n\nBlack Lace played one-off shows in 1996 at DJ conventions in Canada and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], United States. They released the ''Action Party'' and ''Best Of'' albums. Gibb was presented with a special Agadoo guitar to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary, but in 1996 Gibb was also made bankrupt by the [[Inland Revenue]].<ref name=\"Goliath\">{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8527665/The-awful-curse-of-Agadoo.html|title=The awful curse of Agadoo; THEY SANG TERRIBLE SONGS AND WORE DREADFUL CLOTHES BUT DID ANYONE REALLY DESERVE WHAT HAPPENED TO BLACK LACE?|publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com|date=14 December 1996|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n15 August 1997 was deemed Agadoo Day. Black Lace played 20 shows in 24 hours in Manchester, London, Watford, Northampton, Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, and Leeds, finishing at the Frontier Club, Batley. The event raised over \u00a325,000 for [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]]. [[Peugeot]] used \"Agadoo\" in a TV advertisement for the new [[Peugeot 106|106]] car, and Black Lace re-recorded the track renaming it 'Agadoo 106 mix', donating all their royalties to 'Marie Curie Cancer Care'. The record spent one week in the UK chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \n\nA 1999 Black Lace charity reunion concert was organised by their former drummer, Terry Dobson, to celebrate 20 years since the band represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Live television interviews took place with ITV's ''[[ITV News Calendar|Calendar]]'', and the BBC's regional news programmes, on the day of the event.

In 2010, they recorded yet another version of \"I Am The Music Man\", this time entitled \"We Are The England Fans\", as an unofficial England supporters' song to coincide with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which also included the future Black Lace member Craig Harper.

As the song required a more 'throaty' vocal, Alan Barton was switched to being lead singer, with Steve Scholey moving to backing vocals for the band's recordings, but remained as lead singer on live performances.  The song won the [[BBC Television]]'s [[Eurovision: Your Country Needs You|''A Song For Europe'']]. Other television appearances around this time included ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'', ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Juke Box Jury]]''. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in Israel, the band finished seventh and \"Mary Ann\" reached No. 42 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=60}}</ref>\n\nThe band's follow-up single, \"So Long Suzy Baby\", failed to chart in the UK (as EMI couldn't decide on which track should be used and delayed on the planned release date), but achieved success in Europe. Black Lace found great success with live performances and TV shows, notably in Poland and Bulgaria, and on TV in East Germany, West Germany and Spain.\n\nThe band toured Denmark in 1980, supporting [[Suzi Quatro]] and working with [[Tommy Seebach]], a Danish entertainer. Black Lace and Seebach recorded \"Hey Hey Jock McRay\" for the Danish singles market, but an intended 1980 tour of Poland was called off because of political unrest in the country.\n\n==Chart success (1981\u20131987)==\nIn 1981, the band split. Dobson joined the Castleford rock band Stormer who had a recording contract with [[Ringo Starr]]. Scholey departed, leaving the others to settle huge debts incurred whilst touring. The band became a duo of Gibb and Barton.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It was this line-up that would give the band its biggest [[Record chart|chart]] success.\n\nThe duo played the Northern club circuit using pre-recorded backing tracks, which was controversial at the time. Initially they used the name 'Lace' but soon reverted to 'Black Lace' and recruited a new manager, John Wagstaff. They recorded an instrumental single based on the \"[[Chicken Dance]]\", released as \"Birds Dance\" in 1981 (using the name 'Busby' instead of Black lace).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wired for Sound: Now That's What I Call An Eighties Music Childhood|last=Bromley|first=Tom|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2012|isbn=9780857203236}}</ref> However, the record was beaten to the charts by another version of the song by The Tweets released as \"The Birdie Song\". \"Birds Dance\" has since been retitled \"The Birdie Song\" and included on Black Lace albums.\n\nBlack Lace's 1983 \"Superman\" single was their first one under their own name on the Flair label,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and a promotional [[Music video|video]] was shot at Casanova's [[nightclub]] in Wakefield. One of the hired dancers was the then unknown singer [[Jane McDonald]]. \"Superman\" reached No. 9 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> but an attempt at a follow-up single \"Hey You!\" failed to chart despite being [[BBC Radio One]]'s 'Record of the Week'. Black Lace received a [[Music recording sales certification|silver disc]] for sales of \"Superman\". They proceeded to tour Denmark with Danish stars '[[Laban (artist)|Laban]]' and 'Snapshots'\n\nThe band's biggest success came in 1984 with the single \"[[Agadoo]]\", selling over one million copies worldwide and reaching No. 2 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \"Agadoo\" was a hit in Europe, South Africa and Australia. Having been presented with a gold disc for sales in the UK. In a radio interview, presenter, Richard Whiteley forgets Gibb's name and refers to him as 'Mr Agadoo' (the name, Dean Michaels latter adopts for himself, although having no connection with the actual record) The duo recorded their first album ''Black Lace'' at Stuck Ranch studios in Denmark. Around this time their record distribution company 'Pinicle' went into receivership, leading to Black Lace and their record company losing an estimated quarter of a million pounds in unpaid [[royalties]] for \"Agadoo\".\n\nThe band's follow-up single, \"Do The Conga\", reached No. 10 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> and the accompanying album ''Party Party \u2013 16 Great Party Icebreakers'' sold over 650,000 copies in the first five weeks, reaching double platinum status and leading to the band doing TV shows in Germany, Luxembourg, France and Denmark.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1985 another single, \"El Vino Collapso\", was released, with the video shot in Skegness. It failed to reach the top 40, stalling at No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart due to it being 'banned' by the BBC in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], as it had references to \"drinking whilst abroad\" and deemed unsuitable for radio play.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Further releases \"I Speaka Da Lingo\" and \"Hokey Cokey\" reached No. 49 and No. 31, respectively.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nBlack Lace also participated in the recording of the UK No. 1 hit \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\" as part of the charity ensemble, [[The Crowd (band)|The Crowd]] (which included members of [[10cc]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[The Hollies]], [[Argent (band)|Argent]], [[The Who]], [[The Nolans]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[Smokie (band)|Smokey]], [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]], plus many more) to raise funds for the families of the victims of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 2\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=128}}</ref>\n\nBlack Lace's second album ''Party Party 2'' was released for Christmas 1985, and television appearances included a Black Lace special on the [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] rock show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', plus  ''[[3-2-1]]'', ''[[ITV Telethon]]'', ''Miss Yorkshire Television'', ''International Disco Dance Championship'', ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'', and ''Top of the Pops'' Christmas Special. Because of such a demanding work schedule, Barton and Gibb found it necessary to charter a private aircraft to meet the deadlines, but the band's success led to a tax demand in excess of \u00a3100,000.\n\nIn 1986, Dene Michael replaced Gibb, who took time out of live work with Black Lace (remaining an official member of the band) to concentrate on other projects including: promoting pop act 'Party Party' and participating in two tours of Germany, concentrating on a part time photography business, setting up a food retail outlet, and a music equipment retail and installation business. \n\nAnother single, \"Wig Wam Bam\", (featuring Barton, Gibb and Michael) reached No. 63 in the UK chart,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> but \"Viva La Mexico\", which was released to capitalise on the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] football competition, flopped when [[England national football team|England]] was knocked out. Black Lace (Barton and Michael) appeared as themselves in the filming of the 1987 film ''[[Rita, Sue and Bob Too]]'', which featured \"Gang Bang\" and \"Have a Screw\", which had been recorded by Barton and Gibb the previous year. The pair (Barton/Michael) where also immortalised as caricatures in the TV show '[[Spitting Image]]' and the hit single '[[The Chicken Song]]'. The band had a UK hit with their album ''Party Crazy''.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\n==Later career 1987\u2013present)==\nSeptember 1987 saw a switch round, Gibb returned \u2018full time\u2019 with the band whilst Barton left to join Smokie.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Michael became a full-time member of Black Lace and he and Gibb released the single \"Jammin' the Sixties\" under the name Barracuda. The record was BBC Radio One's Record of the Week, but failed to chart. Summer seasons at the [[Blackpool Tower]] followed in 1989 and 1990, plus performances at the 'BBC Radio One Roadshow' in the town, along with the release of the single \"I Am The Music Man\" which peaked at No. 52 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /><ref name=\"AMG\" />\nIn 1991, due to personal issues, Michael was forced to leave the band to be replaced by Rob Hopcraft. The pair released the single \"Penny Arcade\", penned by close friend Sammy King, which had originally been a hit for [[Roy Orbison]] in 1979. The band appeared on the BBC's ''[[Children in Need]]'' programme. Under an agreement with Gibb and Wagstaf, not to use the 'Black lace' name, Michael forms new band and uses the name \u2018'Barracuda'\u2019 but shortly disband.\n1992 Black Lace toured Australia, but Hopcraft was unhappy with a hits album released by an Australian record company as it featured a photograph of his predecessor Dene Michael.\n\n1994 saw the release of the single \"Bullshit (Cotton Eyed Joe)\", but the race for the charts was won by the Swedish band [[Rednex]] with another version of the same song. An album, ''Saturday Night'', followed.\n\nIn 1995, Barton died as a result of a coach crash in Germany while touring with Smokie.<ref>{{cite news|author=Pierre Perrone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alan-barton-1616108.html|title=Obituary: Alan Barton|work=The Independent|date=18 April 1995|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> Also in that year Black Lace shot a promotional video for the single \"Electric Slide\" in [[Benidorm]], the first video not to be filmed in the UK, and played on British breakfast station [[GMTV]] live from [[Torremolinos]] in Spain.\n\nBlack Lace played one-off shows in 1996 at DJ conventions in Canada and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], United States.

Black Lace played 20 shows in 24 hours in Manchester, London, Watford, Northampton, Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, and Leeds, finishing at the Frontier Club, Batley. The event raised over \u00a325,000 for [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]]. [[Peugeot]] used \"Agadoo\" in a TV advertisement for the new [[Peugeot 106|106]] car, and Black Lace re-recorded the track renaming it 'Agadoo 106 mix', donating all their royalties to 'Marie Curie Cancer Care'. The record spent one week in the UK chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> \n\nA 1999 Black Lace charity reunion concert was organised by their former drummer, Terry Dobson, to celebrate 20 years since the band represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Live television interviews took place with ITV's ''[[ITV News Calendar|Calendar]]'', and the BBC's regional news programmes, on the day of the event. The late Alan Barton's son, Dean, took Alan's place in the band, but original member Steve Scholey declined to attend.\n\n2001, a totally different line up style as Hopcraft is replaced by female vocalist/dancer, Camille Wagstaff and release the single 'Follow the leader' before disbanding. \n\nIn 2002, Colin Gibb took the original Black Lace show to [[Tenerife]], playing the now internationally famous 'party shows' in hotels and restaurants on the island, occasionally visiting the UK for TV appearances.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> In 2003, an adult-themed album called ''Blue'' (originally recorded in the UK years previously by Gibb and Michael, and 'banned' by their own record label) was released. In 2004, Gibb took the Black Lace show to mainland Spain to appear alongside Elvis tribute artiste Mike Young and other guest acts at 'The King Lives On' cabaret bar on the [[Costa Blanca]], returning to Tenerife for contracted shows in 2005. In 2007, Gibb married in the UK his long-time girlfriend Sue Kelly. In 2008, Gibb was invited to play bass with the Tenerife-based five-piece rock band 'The Phoenix', along with the duos 'To The Limit' and Just one more'. More recently, he played in the blues rock band Traveler, in addition to performing the Black Lace Show.\n\nIn 2007, Michael started performing again as Black Lace (in contradiction to an agreement with Gibb and record company/management NOW Music, stating he would never use the title 'Black Lace') alongside a new addition, the Liverpudlian singer Ian Robinson. They released a new mambo version of \"Agadoo\". In the accompanying video, [[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]] played a cameo role and directed the event. [[Roy \"Chubby\" Brown]] and [[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]] also made cameo appearances in the video, as did several members of the cast of the ITV situation comedy ''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]''. On 4 November 2009, the 'new' incarnation of Black Lace was filmed by the British airline [[easyJet]], performing a re-written version of \"Agadoo\" for release on the video-sharing website [[YouTube]], launching a new air service between [[Gatwick Airport]] and [[Agadir]] in Morocco. Dobson's book, ''And Then Came Agadoo'', was published by Authorhouse in November 2009.\n\nMichael and Robinson recorded a new version of \"I Am The Music Man\" for the BBC ''Children in Need'' appeal in 2009. In 2010, they recorded yet another version of \"I Am The Music Man\", this time entitled \"We Are The England Fans\", as an unofficial England supporters' song to coincide with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which also included the future Black Lace member Craig Harper. In 2011, Michael and Robinson recorded a television advertisement for [[Trainline|Thetrainline.com]] which led to a new recording of \"Do The Conga\". In December that year, Michael teamed up with [[Crissy Rock]] and recorded a Christmas single called \"Christmas Time\" and an accompanying video. In 2012, Michael recorded two solo records, ''Life Force'' and ''The First Christmas Light''.\n\nIn 2014, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of \"Agadoo\", a limited edition ''Black Lace Live'' album was released, which was recorded and mixed in [[Tenerife]].\n\nOn 24 January 2015, Dene Michael auditioned for the reality TV show ''[[The Voice UK|The Voice]]'', where he sang [[George Benson]]'s \"[[Never Give Up on a Good Thing]]\".

{"title_page": "Contact electrification", "text_new": "'''Contact electrification''' was an erroneous scientific theory from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that attempted to account for all the sources of [[Electrical charge|electric charge]] known at the time.<ref>Willem Hackmann,  \"[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's \"Contact Tension\" and the Development of the \"Dry Pile\"]\", appearing in ''[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times] Volume 3'' (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000) pp. 103-119</ref> It has since been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]] by more modern notions.  In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as [[Electrostatics|electrostatic charge]] imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or ''contact tension'',  was quickly discovered. \n\nWhen two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, [[Voltaic pile]]s, could also produce charge differences.  Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - [[triboelectricity]], the Volta effect, differing [[work function]]s of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called 'frictional' [[electrostatic generator]]s such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to the development of useful devices such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s, [[electroplating]], [[thermocouple]]s. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including [[crystal radio receiver|radio detector diodes]], [[solar cell|photocell]]s, [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, and [[thermoelectric cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe theory held that static electricity was generated by means of contact between dissimilar materials, and was in close agreement with the principles of [[static electricity]] as then understood. It was eventually replaced by the current theory of [[electrochemistry]], namely, that electricity is generated by the action of [[chemistry]] and the exchange of [[electron]]s between [[atom]]s making up the battery.  An important fact leading to the rejection of the theory of contact tension was the observation that [[corrosion]], that is, the chemical degradation of the battery, seemed unavoidable with its use, and that the more electricity was drawn from the battery, the faster the corrosion proceeded.\n\nThe Volta effect (described below) corresponds to a weak [[electric potential]] difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a [[contact potential difference]]. This effect was first discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]], and can be measured using a [[capacitance electroscope]] comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries.\n\nA number of [[high voltage]] [[dry pile]]s were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the answer to this question, and specifically to support Volta\u2019s hypothesis of contact tension. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] is one example. [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact, even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Triboelectric contact==\n{{main|Triboelectric effect}}\nIf two different [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] are touched together, such as when a piece of rubber is touched against a piece of glass, then the surface of the rubber will acquire an excess negative charge, and the glass will acquire an equal positive charge.  If the surfaces are then pulled apart, a very [[high voltage]] is produced.  This so-called \"tribo\" or \"rubbing\" effect is not well understood.  It may be caused by electron-stealing via [[quantum tunneling]], or by transfer of surface ions.  Friction is not required, although in many situations it greatly increases the phenomenon.  Certain phenomena related to frictionally generated electrostatic charges have been known since antiquity, though of course the modern theory of electricity was developed after the [[Scientific Revolution]].\n\n===Solid-solid contact===\nThe mechanism of contact electrification (CE) between solid-solid has been debated for more than 2600 years. A most controversial topic in CE is the identity of the charge carriers: electron transfer, ion transfer or even materials species transfer.

Then, ion transfer is the second step, which is a redistribution of the ions in solution considering electrostatic interactions with the charged solid surface (Fig. 2). Both electron transfer and ion transfer co-exist at liquid-solid interface.\n[[File:Two-step model for EDL.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2 The \"two-step\" model (Wang model) for the formation of electric double-layer (EDL) at a liquid-solid interface, in which the electron transfer plays a dominant role in the first step.]]\n\n==Electrolytic-metallic contact==\nIf a piece of metal is touched against an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] material, the metal will spontaneously become charged, while the electrolyte will acquire an equal and opposite charge.  Upon first contact, a chemical reaction called a '[[half-cell reaction]]' occurs on the metal surface.  As metal ions are transferred to or from the electrolyte, and as the metal and electrolyte become oppositely charged, the increasing voltage at the thin insulating [[electrical double layer|layer]] between metal and electrolyte will oppose the motion of the flowing ions, causing the chemical reaction to come to a stop.  If a second piece of a different type of metal is placed in the same electrolyte bath, it will charge up and rise to a different voltage.  If the first metal piece is touched against the second, the voltage on the two metal pieces will be forced closer together, and the chemical reactions will run constantly.  In this way the 'contact electrification' becomes continuous.  At the same time, an electric current will appear, with the path forming a closed loop which leads from one metal part to the other, through the chemical reactions on the first metal surface, through the electrolyte, then back through the chemical reactions on the second metal surface.  In this way, contact electrification leads to the invention of the [[Galvanic cell]] or [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. ''See also: [[Dry pile]]''\n\n==Metallic contact==\n{{main|Galvani potential}}\n{{main|Volta potential}}\nIf two metals having differing [[work function]]s are touched together, one steals electrons from the other, and the opposite net charges grow larger and larger; this is the Volta effect.  The process is halted when the difference in [[electric potential]] (electrostatic potential) between the two metals reaches a particular value, namely the difference in work function values - usually less than one volt.  At this point, the Fermi levels for the two metals are equal, and there is no voltage difference between them. [If there were a voltage difference between them, then a current would flow between them:  so \"zero current\" implies \"zero voltage difference\".]\n\n==Semiconductor contact==\nIf a metal touches a semiconductor material, or if two different semiconductors are placed into contact, one becomes charged slightly positive and the other slightly negative.  It is found that if this junction between semiconductors is connected to a power supply, and if the power supply is set to a voltage slightly higher than the natural voltage appearing because of contact electrification, then for one polarity of voltage there will be a current between the two semiconductor parts, but if the polarity is reversed, the current stops.  Thus contact between materials lead to the invention of the semiconductor [[diode]] or [[rectifier]] and triggered the revolution in [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronics]] and [[Semiconductor physics|physics]].\n\nIn materials with a [[direct band gap]], if bright light is aimed at one part of the contact area between the two semiconductors, the voltage at that spot will rise, and an electric current will appear.  When considering light in the context of contact electrification{{what|date=April 2014}}, the light energy is changed directly into electrical energy, allowing creation of [[solar cell]]s.  Later it was found that the same process can be reversed, and if a current is forced backwards across the contact region between the semiconductors, sometimes light will be emitted, allowing creation of the [[light-emitting diode]] (LED).\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Contact Electrification}}\n[[Category:Electrical phenomena]]\n[[Category:History of physics]]\n[[Category:Obsolete scientific theories]]\n", "text_old": "'''Contact electrification''' was an erroneous scientific theory from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that attempted to account for all the sources of [[Electrical charge|electric charge]] known at the time.<ref>Willem Hackmann,  \"[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's \"Contact Tension\" and the Development of the \"Dry Pile\"]\", appearing in ''[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times] Volume 3'' (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000) pp. 103-119</ref> It has since been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]] by more modern notions.  In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as [[Electrostatics|electrostatic charge]] imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or ''contact tension'',  was quickly discovered. \n\nWhen two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, [[Voltaic pile]]s, could also produce charge differences.  Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - [[triboelectricity]], the Volta effect, differing [[work function]]s of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called 'frictional' [[electrostatic generator]]s such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to the development of useful devices such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s, [[electroplating]], [[thermocouple]]s. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including [[crystal radio receiver|radio detector diodes]], [[solar cell|photocell]]s, [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, and [[thermoelectric cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe theory held that static electricity was generated by means of contact between dissimilar materials, and was in close agreement with the principles of [[static electricity]] as then understood. It was eventually replaced by the current theory of [[electrochemistry]], namely, that electricity is generated by the action of [[chemistry]] and the exchange of [[electron]]s between [[atom]]s making up the battery.  An important fact leading to the rejection of the theory of contact tension was the observation that [[corrosion]], that is, the chemical degradation of the battery, seemed unavoidable with its use, and that the more electricity was drawn from the battery, the faster the corrosion proceeded.\n\nThe Volta effect (described below) corresponds to a weak [[electric potential]] difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a [[contact potential difference]]. This effect was first discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]], and can be measured using a [[capacitance electroscope]] comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries.\n\nA number of [[high voltage]] [[dry pile]]s were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the answer to this question, and specifically to support Volta\u2019s hypothesis of contact tension. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] is one example. [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact, even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Triboelectric contact==\n{{main|Triboelectric effect}}\nIf two different [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] are touched together, such as when a piece of rubber is touched against a piece of glass, then the surface of the rubber will acquire an excess negative charge, and the glass will acquire an equal positive charge.  If the surfaces are then pulled apart, a very [[high voltage]] is produced.  This so-called \"tribo\" or \"rubbing\" effect is not well understood.  It may be caused by electron-stealing via [[quantum tunneling]], or by transfer of surface ions.  Friction is not required, although in many situations it greatly increases the phenomenon.  Certain phenomena related to frictionally generated electrostatic charges have been known since antiquity, though of course the modern theory of electricity was developed after the [[Scientific Revolution]].\n\n===Solid-solid contact===\nThe mechanism of contact electrification (CE) between solid-solid has been debated for more than 2600 years.

The historical gap between ease of use, but intermittent [[Sphygmomanometer|upper arm instruments]] and bulky, but continuous \u201cpulse writers\u201d ([[sphygmograph]]s) is discussed starting with the first efforts to measure pulse, published by [[Jules Harrison]] in 1835. Such [[sphygmograph]]s led a shadowy existence in the past, while [[Scipione Riva-Rocci|Riva Rocci's]] upper arm blood pressure measurement started its triumphant success over 100 years ago. In recent times, CNAP measurement introduced by [[Jan Pen\u00e1z]] in 1973 enabled the first recording of noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure resulting in marketed products such as the Finapres\u2122 device and its successors. Recently, a novel method for CNAP monitoring has been designed for patient monitoring in perioperative, critical and emergency care, where blood pressure needs to be measured repeatedly or even continuously to facilitate the best care for patients.\n\n==Early sphygmographs==\nPrior to quantitative measurement, which was applied in medicine in the 19th century, diagnostic possibilities of hemodynamic activities had been limited to qualitative sensing of pulse through [[palpation]].

A fluid filled bladder placed on the wrist was able to detect pulse; the pressure, which was necessary for the disappearance of the pulses, was measured with a mercury manometer. This allowed the first measurement of systolic blood pressure.<ref>Basch von S. \u00dcber die Messung des Blutdrucks am Menschen.

One reason might be that the former practice totally relied on the observation of breathing as the sole method of monitoring; even the palpation of pulse during ether or chloroform administration was not recognized as a good practice. Another reason may be found directly in the title of the report: \u201cA simple and accurate form of sphygmometer or arterial pressure gauge contrived for clinical use\u201d \u2013 implying that for clinical use the device must be simple and accurate.\n\n==Early vascular unloading technique==\nWhile the sphygmomanometer had started its triumphant advance, only a few pulse registration devices were invented in the 20th century. Plain plethysmographic devices like pulse oximeters are, of course, the exception, but they cannot be used for blood pressure measurement. If at all, they can measure blood volume changes. These volume changes cannot easily be transformed into pressure, because the elastic components of the arterial wall are not linear and the smooth muscles also consist of non-elastic parts.. \n\nThe goal is to unload the arterial wall in order to linearize this phenomenon with a counter pressure as high as the pressure inside the artery. Blood volume is kept constant by applying this corresponding pressure from the outside. The continuously changing outside pressure that is needed to keep the arterial blood volume constant directly corresponds to the arterial pressure. It is an instantaneous, continuous measure for arterial blood pressure, which is the basic principle of the so-called \u201cvascular unloading technique\u201d.\n\nIn 1942, the German physiologist Richard Wagner introduced a mechanical system for the identification of blood pressure at the arteria radialis using a mechanical version of the vascular unloading technique, where a counter pressure unloads the arterial wall.<ref>Wagner R: Methodik und Ergebnisse fortlaufender Blutdruckschreibung am Menschen, Leipzig, Georg Thieme Verlag (1942).</ref>\n\n==Electro-pneumatic vascular unloading technique==\nThe Czech physiologist [[Jan Pe\u0148\u00e1z]] introduced the vascular unloading technique on the finger in 1973 by means of an electro-pneumatic control loop. The control loop is shown in the block diagram: a cuff is placed over the finger, as it is the most suitable and an easily accessible region. Inside the cuff, the blood volume in the finger arteries is measured using an infrared light source (L) and a light detecting photocell (PC). The plethysmographic signal (PG) \u2013 the light signal compared to constant C1 \u2013 is an electronic measure for finger blood volume. PG is fed into a control unit having proportional-integral-differential characteristics (PID). The PID-signal is added to a constant set point (C2), amplified and fed to an electro-pneumatic transducer (EPT). EPT produces a pressure in the cuff, which, again, alters finger blood volume.<ref name=\"Penaz_principle\">Pe\u0148\u00e1z J: Photoelectric Measurement of blood pressure, volume and flow in the finger. Digest of the 10th international conference on medical and biological engineering \u2013 Dresden (1973).</ref>\n\n[[File:Penaz principle.jpg|thumb|center|550px|Block diagram of Pe\u0148\u00e1z\u2019 system with single control loop: F \u2013 finger, L \u2013 lamp, PC \u2013 photo cell, S \u2013 segments of transparent pressure cuff, C<sub>1 </sub>\u2013 average of PC-signal, DA \u2013 difference amplifier, V(PG) \u2013 plethysmographic signal, PID \u2013 correcting network, C<sub>2</sub> \u2013 set point SP, SW \u2013 switch between open and closed loop, PA \u2013 power amplifier, EPT \u2013 electro-pneumatic transducer, M(CP) Pressure measured with Manometer. (Constructed with respect to Pe\u0148\u00e1z\u2019 original drawing).<ref name=\"Penaz_principle\" />]]\n\nThe condition of the control loop can be described as follows: The light-signal PG shall become zero by controlling the alterable pressure in the cuff. During systole, when blood volume increases in the finger, the PID-controller increases the control point. Thus, cuff pressure is increased until the excess blood volume is squeezed out. On the other hand, during diastole, the blood volume in the finger is decreased; as a result the PID-controller decreases the control point. Hence, cuff pressure is lowered and the overall blood volume remains constant. As blood volume and thus PG is held constant over time, the pressure difference between cuff pressure and intra-arterial pressure is zero.

Using PDA, the pressure profile of each heart pulse is analyzed for changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure as well as other hemodynamic parameters.  PDA systems offer very low coupling pressures to a finger and track blood pressures for long times.  Like tonometers and PTT methods, the systems must be initially calibrated with an absolute blood pressure from a sphygmomanometer, remote oscillometer, or by using an internal oscillometer in the PDA system.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.caretakermedical.net/medical-papers/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:Blood pressure]]\n", "text_old": "{{Main|Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure}}\nThe article reviews the evolution of [[continuous noninvasive arterial pressure]] measurement (CNAP). The historical gap between ease of use, but intermittent [[Sphygmomanometer|upper arm instruments]] and bulky, but continuous \u201cpulse writers\u201d ([[sphygmograph]]s) is discussed starting with the first efforts to measure pulse, published by [[Jules Harrison]] in 1835. Such [[sphygmograph]]s led a shadowy existence in the past, while [[Scipione Riva-Rocci|Riva Rocci\u2019s]] upper arm blood pressure measurement started its triumphant success over 100 years ago. In recent times, CNAP measurement introduced by [[Jan Pen\u00e1z]] in 1973 enabled the first recording of noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure resulting in marketed products such as the Finapres\u2122 device and its successors. Recently, a novel method for CNAP monitoring has been designed for patient monitoring in perioperative, critical and emergency care, where blood pressure needs to be measured repeatedly or even continuously to facilitate the best care for patients.\n\n==Early sphygmographs==\nPrior to quantitative measurement, which was applied in medicine in the 19th century, diagnostic possibilities of hemodynamic activities had been limited to qualitative sensing of pulse through [[palpation]]. In some cultures, sensitive palpation is still a main part of medicine like pulse diagnosis in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) or the identification of the [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] [[doshas]]. The introduction of the [[stethoscope]] and the methods of [[auscultation]] by [[Ren\u00e9-Th\u00e9ophile-Hyacinthe Laennec]] in 1816 changed the medical behavior consistently and forced the need of quantitative hemodynamic measurements.<ref>Eckert S. 100 Jahre Blutdruckmessung nach Riva-Rocci und Korotkoff: R\u00fcckblick und Ausblick.

A fluid filled bladder placed on the wrist was able to detect pulse; the pressure, which was necessary for the disappearance of the pulses, was measured with a mercury manometer. This allowed the first measurement of systolic blood pressure.<ref>Basch von S. \u00dcber die Messung des Blutdrucks am Menschen.

BMJ 1897 ii 904</ref> It seems surprising that the first report of blood pressure monitoring during anesthesia did not mention the use of sphygmographs, which had already been in common use at this time . One reason might be that the former practice totally relied on the observation of breathing as the sole method of monitoring; even the palpation of pulse during ether or chloroform administration was not recognized as a good practice. Another reason may be found directly in the title of the report: \u201cA simple and accurate form of sphygmometer or arterial pressure gauge contrived for clinical use\u201d \u2013 implying that for clinical use the device must be simple and accurate.\n\n==Early vascular unloading technique==\nWhile the sphygmomanometer had started its triumphant advance, only a few pulse registration devices were invented in the 20th century. Plain plethysmographic devices like pulse oximeters are, of course, the exception, but they cannot be used for blood pressure measurement. If at all, they can measure blood volume changes. These volume changes cannot easily be transformed into pressure, because the elastic components of the arterial wall are not linear and the smooth muscles also consist of non-elastic parts.. \n\nThe goal is to unload the arterial wall in order to linearize this phenomenon with a counter pressure as high as the pressure inside the artery. Blood volume is kept constant by applying this corresponding pressure from the outside. The continuously changing outside pressure that is needed to keep the arterial blood volume constant directly corresponds to the arterial pressure. It is an instantaneous, continuous measure for arterial blood pressure, which is the basic principle of the so-called \u201cvascular unloading technique\u201d.\n\nIn 1942, the German physiologist Richard Wagner introduced a mechanical system for the identification of blood pressure at the arteria radialis using a mechanical version of the vascular unloading technique, where a counter pressure unloads the arterial wall.<ref>Wagner R: Methodik und Ergebnisse fortlaufender Blutdruckschreibung am Menschen, Leipzig, Georg Thieme Verlag (1942).</ref>\n\n==Electro-pneumatic vascular unloading technique==\nThe Czech physiologist [[Jan Pe\u0148\u00e1z]] introduced the vascular unloading technique on the finger in 1973 by means of an electro-pneumatic control loop. The control loop is shown in the block diagram: a cuff is placed over the finger, as it is the most suitable and an easily accessible region. Inside the cuff, the blood volume in the finger arteries is measured using an infrared light source (L) and a light detecting photocell (PC). The plethysmographic signal (PG) \u2013 the light signal compared to constant C1 \u2013 is an electronic measure for finger blood volume. PG is fed into a control unit having proportional-integral-differential characteristics (PID). The PID-signal is added to a constant set point (C2), amplified and fed to an electro-pneumatic transducer (EPT). EPT produces a pressure in the cuff, which, again, alters finger blood volume.<ref name=\"Penaz_principle\">Pe\u0148\u00e1z J: Photoelectric Measurement of blood pressure, volume and flow in the finger. Digest of the 10th international conference on medical and biological engineering \u2013 Dresden (1973).</ref>\n\n[[File:Penaz principle.jpg|thumb|center|550px|Block diagram of Pe\u0148\u00e1z\u2019 system with single control loop: F \u2013 finger, L \u2013 lamp, PC \u2013 photo cell, S \u2013 segments of transparent pressure cuff, C<sub>1 </sub>\u2013 average of PC-signal, DA \u2013 difference amplifier, V(PG) \u2013 plethysmographic signal, PID \u2013 correcting network, C<sub>2</sub> \u2013 set point SP, SW \u2013 switch between open and closed loop, PA \u2013 power amplifier, EPT \u2013 electro-pneumatic transducer, M(CP) Pressure measured with Manometer. (Constructed with respect to Pe\u0148\u00e1z\u2019 original drawing).<ref name=\"Penaz_principle\" />]]\n\nThe condition of the control loop can be described as follows: The light-signal PG shall become zero by controlling the alterable pressure in the cuff. During systole, when blood volume increases in the finger, the PID-controller increases the control point. Thus, cuff pressure is increased until the excess blood volume is squeezed out. On the other hand, during diastole, the blood volume in the finger is decreased; as a result the PID-controller decreases the control point. Hence, cuff pressure is lowered and the overall blood volume remains constant. As blood volume and thus PG is held constant over time, the pressure difference between cuff pressure and intra-arterial pressure is zero. Intra-arterial pressure is equal to cuff pressure, which can easily be measured by means of the manometer M. \n\nPe\u0148\u00e1z used a single electronic control loop, which was responsible for the fast tracking of blood pressure changes as well as for the stability of the system. However, the changes in arterial diameter and in wall tension due to vasoconstriction and vasodilatation make a long-term measurement with this single control loop almost impossible, since the true unloading of the arterial wall is easily lost <ref>Wesseling, K.

Like tonometers and PTT methods, the systems must be initially calibrated with an absolute blood pressure from a sphygmomanometer, remote oscillometer, or by using an internal oscillometer in the PDA system.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.caretakermedical.net/medical-papers/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:Blood pressure]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_continuous_noninvasive_arterial_pressure"}

It began with the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 and ended with the third and final [[Partition of Poland]] in 1795. Sometimes term I Rzeczpospolita is used in reference to Polish country before [[Union of Lublin]] too, because [[szlachta]] ruled in Poland earlier;\n* '''II Rzeczpospolita''' ({{lang-pl|Druga Rzeczpospolita}}), in reference to the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918\u20131939). Used to refer to the [[interwar]] period, lasting from the gaining of independence in 1918 following the end of [[World War I]] up to the [[World War II]]-triggering [[Invasion of Poland (1939)]] by both [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]]. The renascent Polish State was initially called the Republic of Poland ({{lang-pl|Republika Polska}}). The title ''Rzeczpospolita'' was introduced by the [[March Constitution of Poland]], the first article of which stated that {{lang-pl|Pa\u0144stwo Polskie jest Rzecz\u0105pospolit\u0105}}, meaning \"the Polish State is a Commonwealth\";\n* '''III Rzeczpospolita''' ({{lang-pl|Trzecia Rzeczpospolita}}), in reference to the current [[Third Polish Republic]] (1989\u2013present). This is the title of the current Polish State, dating from the overthrow of the Communist government in 1989.\n\n(Please note: The above list is by no means a complete list of the various official titles for the Polish State throughout its history; it is simply a list of those which are referred to as a ''rzeczpospolita''.)\n\n==Other usage==\nExpressions that make use the concept of ''rzeczpospolita'' include:\n* ''Rzeczpospolita szlachecka'' \u2013 Republic of Nobles (''[[szlachta]]''), another name for the [[I Rzeczpospolita]];\n* ''Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod\u00f3w'' \u2013 The Commonwealth of the Two Nations, another name for the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]];\n* ''Rzeczpospolita Babi\u0144ska'' \u2013 [[Babin Republic]], a satirical, literary society, founded by a group of nobles during the second half of the 16th century;\n* ''Rzeczpospolita Krakowska'' \u2013 [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]] or Republic of Krak\u00f3w (1815\u20131846);\n* ''Rzeczpospolita Zakopia\u0144ska'' \u2013 [[Republic of Zakopane]], a short-lasting form of an independent state, established for about a month in October 1918;\n* ''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'' \u2013 [[People's Republic of Poland]], a name used formally from 1952 to 1990.

Based on [[Lombok]] island (approx 60 miles east of [[Bali]] island) the institute received its educational accreditation as a flight academy from [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (Indonesia)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] of [[Indonesia]] in 2010. The institute operates from [[Selaparang Airport]] in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]].\n\n==History==\nLIFT was established in June 2010 in cooperation with a private investor, Edmond Fung, from Hong Kong and a local management from Jakarta. LIFT was the first flight training facility in Indonesia to operate [[glass cockpit]] [[Liberty XL2]] aircraft. The first training flight was made in December 2010.\n\nLIFT has aviation business roots in Indonesia dating to 2005, with the establishment of PT Sky Aviation, a small charter company, which was providing inter-island VIP charter service using US-built [[Cirrus SR22]] aircraft. The operation was housed in the same hangar as the current company's flight operations base. In 2010, the investment company decided to move to a more profitable flight training sector of aviation business and sold PT Sky Aviation to a local Indonesian investment firm while establishing Lombok Institute of Fight Technology.\n\nIn the short history of the school's existence, there has been 2 fatalities to date involving a former chief flight instructor and a student. The aircraft involved with this accident was PK-LLC.<ref>http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/sporean-missing-near-indonesian-island-we-had-glimmer-hope-it-was-not-our-friend</ref> This accident has been attributed to chronic poor maintenance issues due to fuel contamination, a negligent management team and hazardous training standards.<ref>https://www.pprune.org/south-asia-far-east/507677-unsafe-operation-lombok-institute-flight-technology-lift.html</ref>\n\nThe institute is participating in the [[Liberty XL2]] aircraft type certification research.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe fight training campus is located in [[Senggigi]] resort area on the island of [[Lombok]], [[West Nusa Tengara]] in Indonesia. \nA satellite campus (academics only) is located in Serpong, [[Tangerang]], in West [[Jakarta]]\n\nSatellite facilities are located in [[Selaparang International Airport]], in [[Lombok International Airport]], Nusa Alam in Jakarta and [[Sumbawa Besar]] Regional Airport in [[Sumbawa]]\n\nLIFT purchased its first fleet of six [[Liberty XL2]] flight training aircraft from Liberty Aerospace Corporation in Melbourne, Florida, in 2010 and shipped them to [[Johor Baru]] to be later ferried to Lombok. It owns and operates five Liberty XL2 aircraft, both Classic and Vingard editions.\n\nThe flight simulation department houses two full-motion flight simulators capable of semi-realistic reproduction of flight in Liberty XL2 aircraft.\n\n==Criticism and Scandals==\nIn the short history of the school, there has been numerous criticisms on how the school managed its training standards and maintaining its fleet of five Liberty XL2s. Expat pilots who used to work in this institution in the early years were quickly fired due to them raising questionable concerns on the maintenance standards of the airplanes and refusing to fly.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/30/fired-foreign-flyboys-cry-foul-lombok-flight-school.html</ref>\n\nLawsuits and legality issues were raised between the foreign flight instructors and the management team. This constant internal struggle between the two sides eventually attributed to the dismissal of all foreign instructors and now the school only hire locally rated flight instructors.\n\n==Fatalities==\nOn 31 October 2014, the chief flight instructor of the school, 30 year old Singaporean Lua Boon Huan, and a local Indonesian student pilot, 26 year old Jati Wikanto, went on a cross country flight from Lombok to Sumbawa using the Liberty XL2 with the call sign PK-LLC. However, after missing to appear at the local airport, local authorities were alerted and a search and rescue team was dispatched.\n\nThe missing airplane was found near Moyo Island, West Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia. A fire extinguisher of the plane was found in the waters surrounding the island. Both occupants were presumed to be dead.\n\nParts of the airplane that were found were disintegrated into tiny pieces, indicating that the nature of the crash was a high speed collision with the water. It was highly unlikely that this accident was a deliberate act by either pilots, but concluded as an unintentional out of control situation that led to their demise.\n\nThere were many speculations as to what happened to PK-LLC, but according to numerous sources, it points to the highly probable scenario where the airplane's engine quit due to issues with fuel contamination which caused the pilots to panic and put the airplane in an unusual attitude. The unusual attitude could be one that was to either steeply bank the airplane back to the airport or a stall the aircraft, which eventually caused the airplane to spin and plummet to towards the water at a high speed.\n\nPrior to this accident, there were numerous red flags within the school among expat pilots that the airplane had a strong tendency to fall into a spin under full stall or full departure stall procedures. The manufacturer, Liberty Aerospace, itself has stated explicitly that this airplane is not spin approved.\n\n==Financials==\nThe school has faced numerous financial backlashes due to expat pilots demanding money from successful lawsuits against the company. The school's student population have hugely fluctuated in the early years, with many of them demanding money back for not being able to progress in their flight career. The logistics of the school has been hampered due to the relocation of Lombok International airport, requiring students to travel over an hour from home base, Mataram, to fly. The student population has plummeted from 40 to 10 full-time students in the span of 5 years since the commencement of its operation, creating a further strain on the school's financials.\n\nHowever, the school's financials has been constantly backed by its majority owner and shareholder, Edmond Fung, over the last couple years using money inherited from his parent's trust fund based in Hong Kong and China.\n\n==Academics==\nThe institute offers professional pilots courses in the following areas of aeronautical theory:\n*Basic Aerodynamics\n*Advanced Aerodynamics\n*General Navigation\n*Radio Navigation\n*Meteorology\n*Aircraft Systems\n*Instrumentation & Electronics\n*Radio Theory\n*Operational Procedures\n*Aircraft Weight & Balance\n\n==Faculty and staff==\nKey persons in the flight department in 2012 are Chief Flight Instructor Russell Sherwood.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*{{cite news | url = http://us.nasional.news.viva.co.id/news/read/207589-lombok-jadi-pusat-dirgantara-baru | title = Lombok Jadi Pusat Dirgantara Baru | publisher = Viva News | date = 3 March 2011 | author = Arfi Bambani Amri}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.liftflightacademy.com/}}\n* [http://issuu.com/thelombokguide/docs/the_lombok_guide_issue_119/1?zoomed=&zoomPercent=&zoomX=&zoomY=&noteText=&noteX=&noteY=&viewMode=magazine/ Indonesian media publication]\n\n{{Coord|08|33|38|S|116|05|39|E|type:airport|display=inline,title}}\n\n[[Category:Colleges in Indonesia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=September 2012}}\n{{No footnotes|section|date=August 2012}}\n{{Orphan|date=January 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox institute\n|name          = Lombok Institute of Flight Technology\n|image_name    = Lombok Institute of Flight Technology Logo.jpg\n|image_size    =\n|caption       = [[Seal (emblem)|Seal]] of LIFT\n|latin_name = Lombok Instituti Fugae Lorem\n|motto         = ''Volare altius, fugere velocius, fugere novum''\n|mottoeng      = \"Fly higher, fly faster, fly newer\"\n|Owner         = Lalu Didiek, S.E\n|president    = Lalu Didiek, S.E\n|Fatalities   = 2\n\n<!-- |type          = [[Private university|Private]]\n|calendar      = Semester\n|students      = 12\n|undergrad     = 12 \n|postgrad      = 0\n|campus        = [[Urban area|Urban]]\n|colors        = [[Silver]], [[blue]] \n|nickname      = [[LIFT]] -->\n\n|staff         = 12 \n|faculty       = 6\n|city          = [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]]\n|state         = [[Lombok]]\n|country       = [[Indonesia]]\n|website       = {{URL|http://www.liftflightacademy.com/index.html}}\n}}\n'''Lombok Institute of Flight Technology''', also known as '''LIFT''', is an [[Indonesia]]n higher learning institution specializing in theoretical and practical [[aeronautical science]] education.

Tevye is a pious [[Jews in Russia|Jewish]] milkman living in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], the patriarch of a family including several troublesome daughters.{{Efn | In the first short story, there is also a mention of a seventh daughter; in ''Fiddler,'' however, there are only five daughters (using the first five names listed above), of whom only the first three have major roles.}} The village of Boyberik, where the stories are set (renamed Anatevka in ''Fiddler on the Roof),'' is based on the town of [[Boyarka]], Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]].{{Efn | In ''Fiddler,'' the town name is Anatevka.}} The stories were written in [[Yiddish]] and first published in 1894; they have been published as ''Tevye and His Daughters'', ''Tevye's Daughters'', ''Tevye the Milkman'', and ''Tevye the Dairyman''.\n\nAs Tevye \"tells\" Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Beilke, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Tzeitel) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye's stories.  The stories tell of his business dealings, the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters, and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.\n\nThe Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times. Sholem Aleichem's own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919. (Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.) The Broadway musical was based on a play written by [[Arnold Perl]] called ''Tevye and His Daughters''. ''Tevye the Dairyman'' had four film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), Hebrew (1968), English (1971) and Russian (2017).\n\n== Name ==\nTevye's name in Hebrew is \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d1, ''Tuvya ha-cholev'', {{IPA-he|tov\u02c8ja (h)a\u03c7o\u02c8lev|}}, ''Tevye'' being the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of [[Tobias]].\n\n==English translations==\n''Tevye the Dairyman'' comprises eight stories, with Tevye each time supposedly meeting Sholom Aleichem by chance and relating the latest tale of his trials and tribulations.  They have been published in translation under the following titles:<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = [[Hillel Halkin]] transl | publisher = [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] | year = 1987 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories | series = Library of Yiddish Classics | ISBN = 0-8052-1069-5}}</ref>\n# ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'' (also translated as ''Tevye Wins a Fortune'' or ''The Great Windfall'')\n# ''Tevye Blows A Small Fortune'' (also translated as ''The Roof Falls In'' or ''The Bubble Bursts'')\n# ''Today's Children'' (also translated as ''Modern Children'')\n# ''Hodel''\n# ''Chava''\n# ''Shprintze''\n# ''Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel'' (also translated as ''Tevye Goes to Palestine'' or ''Tevye is Going to Eretz Yisroel'')\n# ''Lekh-Lekho'' (also translated as ''Get Thee Out'')\n\nThe original stories included events not depicted in ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

Tevye is a pious [[Jews in Russia|Jewish]] milkman living in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], the patriarch of a family including several troublesome daughters.{{Efn | In the first short story, there is also a mention of a seventh daughter; in ''Fiddler,'' however, there are only five daughters (using the first five names listed above), of whom only the first three have major roles.}} The village of Boyberik, where the stories are set (renamed Anatevka in ''Fiddler on the Roof),'' is based on the town of [[Boyarka]], Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]].{{Efn | In ''Fiddler,'' the town name is Anatevka.}} The stories were written in [[Yiddish]] and first published in 1894; they have been published as ''Tevye and His Daughters'', ''Tevye's Daughters'', ''Tevye the Milkman'', and ''Tevye the Dairyman''.\n\nAs Tevye \"tells\" Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Beilke, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Tzeitel) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye's stories.  The stories tell of his business dealings, the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters, and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.\n\nThe Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times. Sholem Aleichem's own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919. (Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.) The Broadway musical was based on a play written by [[Arnold Perl]] called ''Tevye and His Daughters''. ''Tevye the Dairyman'' had four film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), Hebrew (1968), English (1971) and Russian (2017).\n\n== Name ==\nTevye's name in Hebrew is \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d1, ''Tuvya ha-cholev'', {{IPA-he|tov\u02c8ja (h)a\u03c7o\u02c8lev|}}, ''Tevye'' being the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of [[Tobias]].\n\n==English translations==\n''Tevye the Dairyman'' comprises eight stories, with Tevye each time supposedly meeting Sholom Aleichem by chance and relating the latest tale of his trials and tribulations.  They have been published in translation under the following titles:<ref>{{Citation | first = Sholom | last = Aleichem | others = [[Hillel Halkin]] transl | publisher = [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] | year = 1987 | title = Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories | series = Library of Yiddish Classics | ISBN = 0-8052-1069-5}}</ref>\n# ''Tevye Strikes It Rich'' (also translated as ''Tevye Wins a Fortune'' or ''The Great Windfall'')\n# ''Tevye Blows A Small Fortune'' (also translated as ''The Roof Falls In'' or ''The Bubble Bursts'')\n# ''Today's Children'' (also translated as ''Modern Children'')\n# ''Hodel''\n# ''Chava''\n# ''Shprintze''\n# ''Tevye Leaves for the Land of Israel'' (also translated as ''Tevye Goes to Palestine'' or ''Tevye is Going to Eretz Yisroel'')\n# ''Lekh-Lekho'' (also translated as ''Get Thee Out'')\n\nThe original stories included events not depicted in ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

Originally self-pressed and intended to be sold independently, it wasn't long before Tinman Records signed Interface to a distribution deal. Between the album's release and the band's increasing marketing presence on the internet, Interface's fanbase grew accordingly. Tinman also lifted the track \"Frantic\" for their compilation CD ''Ringworm V1'' in early 1999. It received favorable reviews in publications like \"DAMN!\" magazine and the Long Island Press.\n\nOverall, the album's raw, gritty sound is reminiscent of mid 1990s [[electro-industrial]], combining definitive recordings of tracks heard on earlier demo tapes with newer dance tracks and atmospheric instrumentals. The album was mainly performed, produced, and recorded by Eric Eldredge in the fall of 1998. It includes two of the band's most enduring songs, \"Metalstorm\" and \"The Softest Blade\". \n\nThe album's name comes from an article in a psychology magazine about women's behavior patterns when expecting negative results from romantic relationships before they occur.\n\nThe cover was designed by photo artist Kim Lauer, and depicts a heavily manipulated image of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]].\n\nWith the now-defunct Tinman label's quantities depleted, the original album is now out of print.\n\n==2007 Re-Release==\nIn 2007, [[Nilaihah Records]] had the album re-mastered and re-released through its digital download outlets.
