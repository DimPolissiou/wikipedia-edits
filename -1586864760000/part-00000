However, the war in the book was from 1930 to 1932, whereas the Second World War started about ten years later. Therefore, unless Gann was making a very serious mistake, he could not be referring to it.

Gann (1927)|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> believes that the title of the book is an anagram. He replaced the \u201c1940\u201d in the title with the following letters:\n* The number \u201c0\u201d is replaced by the letter \u201cO\u201d.\n* The remaining numbers 1, 4, 9 are worked in the following ways:\n** 1 x 9 x 4 = 36, 3 x 6 = 18, and the 18th letter is \u201cR\u201d\n** 1 & 9 are \u201c19\u201d, and the 19th letter is \u201cS\u201d\n** 9 + 4 = 13, and the 13th letter is \u201cM\u201d\nHe rearranged the letters, and the title became \u201cFrom the Lunar Return, Looking back to His Mother\u201d. Amundsen noted that Marie disappeared on 5 June 1927, when the Moon was in Leo, and she reappeared on 30 August 1932, when the Moon was in Leo again.\n\nHe also noted that the date of the Foreword was 9 May 1927, which was 1940 days before the end of the novel, 30 August 1932.\n\n=== Book cover ===\nThe original 1927 book cover depicts some planes flying around a tunnel in the sky. Paul Nipperess<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gann.su/book/eng/11998.pdf|title=Introduction to Gann Signs|last=Nipperess|first=Paul|date=2004|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> notices that the number and location of planes displays some [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci relationships]].\n\n=== Fake quotes ===\nThere are a number of quotes in the book which are unclear if they are really said or written by the person.<ref name=\":6\" /> For example, on page 191, Gann \u201cquoted\u201d [[Pythagoras]] in the following passage: \u201c\u2018There are in woman\u2019s eyes two sorts of tears, the one of grief; the other of deceit.\u2019 I think that is because there are two kinds of men, one who appreciates love and honor and gives sympathy; the other kind who is selfish, expects something for nothing and must meet with deceit.\u201d Brian Sklenka<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> thinks that Gann was trying to draw the readers\u2019 attention to the Pyathagoras, and the numbers \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cone\u201d, indirectly hinting that the [[Octave|octave theory]] discovered by the Greek philosopher.\n\nSimilarly, on page 192, Gann included the following \u201cquote\u201d from [[Robert Southey|Southey]], \u201cThere are three things a wise man will not trust, the wind, the sunshine of an April day and a woman\u2019s plighted faith.\u201d Again, it is an association of the British poet and the number \u201cthree\u201d, which is an indirect reference to his famous story [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]. Some esoteric writers like S. J. Pasagic<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Whisper|last=Pasagic|first=S. J.|publisher=RoseDog Books|year=2011|isbn=9781434975454|location=Pittsburgh, PA|pages=}}</ref> believes that the story is a hidden reference to the Law of Three (see [[Fourth Way#Basis of teachings|the teachings of George Gurdjieff]]).\n\n=== Page numbers ===\nMany believe that Gann used the pages numbers in the 1927 original edition to encode some of his secrets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://technical-analysis-addins.com/trading-gann-smithson.php|title=James Smithson on WD GANN|last=Smithson|first=James|date=2016|website=XL Trader|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rosecast.com/learn-astrology-with-the-tunnel-thru-the-air/|title=Learn Astrology with \"The Tunnel Thru the Air\"|last=Rosecast School of Financial Astrology|website=Rosecast|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref> Here are some examples that the page number is related to the information on that page:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Page Number\n!Content of the Page\n!Remarks\n|-\n|12\n|This is a part of Chapter 2 in which Robert's mother expressed that \u201cBobbie had advanced ideas fully a hundred years ahead of his time and that he should be educated and allowed to follow his own ideas\u201d.\n|The page number (12) to the chapter number (2) is 144.

The moment of parting Marie and Robert. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer, the Moon at the time of the onset of the event in 28 degrees of Cancer. \n# Paris, late February 1929. The illusion of meeting Robert and Marie. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer on a heliocentric chart. Moon Return on the geo-map. \n# New York, August 30, 1932, 11 am. Meeting Robert and Marie. Lunar return. The connection of Mars and Venus is very close to Cancer.\n\n== Weather forecasting along the Mississippi River ==\nIn 1994, retired engineer Bonnie Lee Hill did a public seminar in which she revealed some astrological methods concealed in the Tunnel Thru the Air.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of the trading rules used by Gann are related to the weather in the area around the [[Mississippi River]], and they are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rule (as coined by Hill)\n!Planets\n!Time Window\n!Aspect Formed\n!Details\n!Implication in Cotton Prices\n|-\n|Wet Cotton Farmer\n|[[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Before mid-April of each calendar year\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Multiples of the 8th (45\u00b0) or 12th (30\u00b0) harmonic\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River will flood in that year.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|-\n|Poor Cotton Farmer\n|[[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the rainfall along the Mississippi will be ideal to grow crops.\n|The supply would increase and the price would fall.\n|-\n|Dry Cotton Farmer\n|[[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River area will experience horrible drought.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|}\nThe last rule (\"Dry Cotton Farmer\") was actually not mentioned at all in the book. It was deduced by Hill after she discovered the first two rules. Here are some actual examples from Hill's lecture:\n\n=== Wet Cotton Farmer (Uranus-Neptune) ===\n* In 1735, geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune. Over ninety percent of New Orleans was under water. The entire region was drastically affected by the flooding in the Delta.\n* In 1762, geocentric Uranus 135\u00b0 with Neptune. This was a major flood. For instance,the flood level in the city of Cincinnati was up 80 feet. The top of a church steeple was the only thing sticking out of the water in the little town of Cincinnati.\n* In 1821 (geocentric Uranus conjunct Neptune), we had another major flood. They called it the \u201cworst flood of the century\u201d. The reporters said that they had no words to describe the damage from this flood. They couldn't even estimate the cost of the damage. People decided give major sections of land back to the Mississippi River. They would not farm the land, and they would not build towns on the land. The people realized that the Mississippi River would always \u201cwin\u201d.\n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1881 (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune). Please notice that we had a major flood in 1881, and another major flood in 1882. Due to retrogradation, we had the same aspect (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune) on Feb 26, 1881 and April 8, 1882. There are cases in which we had major floods three years in a row because the same aspect occurred in the spring of all three years. The floods in 1881-1882 were very famous. Mark Twain was alive during that time. He actually went down the Mississippi River on a steam boat, and said the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide at that time. The channel of the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide. \n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1907 (geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune). This is the flood mentioned by Gann in The Tunnel Thu the Air. Please notice that we had a flood in 1907, and in 1908. Why? The same aspect occurred in the spring of both years. \n* The next big flood occurred in 1927 (geocentric Uranus 150 Neptune). This is the one that Gann predicts in The Tunnel Thru the Air. They had a late spring and a major flood. There was over $284 million in damage. It was estimated that 240 billion gallons of water came down the Mississippi River that spring. They had 1.8 million acres of land under water. A lot of people feel that this was one of the major causes of the Great Depression; the flood destroyed the economy through the Mississippi basin. This totally destroyed the cotton crops.\n* The next major flood occurred in 1935 (geocentric Uranus 135 Neptune). The same aspect occurred in the spring of 1936, and a second flood occurred. The flood in 1936 caused $270 million in damage.\n* In 1943, geocentric Uranus trine Neptune. A major flood occurred which caused $172 million in damage. In 1973, we saw geocentric Uranus semi-square Neptune. A major flood caused $420 million of damage. October cotton hit a high price of 99 cents at this time. In 1979, a major flood occurred. Geocentric Uranus was semi-sextile Neptune on March 31, 1979.\n* In 1993, geocentric Uranus was conjunct Neptune on February 2. What happened in 1993? The same thing that occurred in 1821, approximately 173 years earlier. Once again, the Mississippi River looks like an inland lake. Many, many acres are under water and they are currently discussing buying the land from the farmers, giving it back to the river, and saying we won't grow crops there again and we won't build buildings there again. The ticket for this flood at the time of the seminar was $12 billion.\n\n=== Poor Cotton Farmer (Jupiter-Neptune) ===\n* In 1844, cotton had an extreme low of 5 cents a pound. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 27, 1844. Since this is rain during the growing season, you will find this class of aspects can happen a little later in the season. It's not required that they be more like January or February. They can be more like March\u2013April.\n* On March 2, 1851, geocentric Jupiter was 135 degrees from Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 8.25 cents in January 1852.\n* On April 7, 1857, geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 9.25 cents in January 1858.In 1871, cotton hit the lowest low it had ever hit since 1860 (13.50 cents). \n* On April 8, 1871, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune. In 1873, cotton hit another major low of 13.80. Geocentric Jupiter was trine Neptune on March 3, 1873.\n* Cotton hit another major low (6.20 cents) in 1896. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-square Neptune on February 26, 1896.\n* Geocentric Jupiter was square Neptune on March 14, 1904. This was a major low in cotton prices. On July 19, cotton sold for 6.85. The cotton farmers were so disgusted that they burned the cotton in the fields. They did not even go to the effort of harvesting it. Hundreds of cotton farmers abandoned their farms and left. It was not worth cotton farming again. No one would ever want cotton ever again. They gave up.\n* Very low cotton prices occurred in 1920. Geocentric Jupiter was conjunct Neptune on March 8, 1920.\n* On April 17, 1926, geocentric Jupiter was opposite Neptune. In March 1927, cotton hit a low of 11.80. The government reports showed a record crop.\n* Cotton hit a major low of 25.20 cents in December 1970. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 29, 1970.Cotton hit a major low of 26.59 in December 1972. \n* On March 10, 1972, geocentric Jupiter was again semi-sextile Neptune.Cotton hit a major low of 29.99 in July\u2013August 1986. \n* On March 16, 1986, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune.\n\n=== Dry Cotton Farmer (Saturn-Neptune) ===\n* In 1761, we had a major drought in the country. Geo Saturn was 135 degrees from Neptune on April 13, 1761. The next year, geo Saturn was again 135 degrees from Neptune on February 6, 1792. We had another major drought in 1762.\n* On April 13, 1816, geocentric Saturn was sextile Neptune. There was a major drought and crop failure in 1816.\n* On January 14, 1860, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The year 1860 is famous for the Kansas drought. Hundreds of people moved to Kansas tostart over. They planned to start farming, and make a fortune. Many of these farmers gave up and left Kansas after the drought of 1860. They said you just can't make it in Kansas. \n* On March 11, 1863, geocentric Saturn was opposite Neptune. There was a major drought. Cotton hit the highest price it had ever seen 91 cents. That is 91 cents in 1863 dollars. Why was cotton so high? First, there was a major drought. Second, the Civil War was disrupting the economy. \n* On February 1, 1869, geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. In 1869, cotton hit a high of 35 cents before a huge decline in price.\n* On January 31, 1903, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The drought was so severe that cotton farmers planted their crops in a different manner. There was a little bug that grew in certain crops, and the farmers planted those crops next to the cotton. This little bug was called the boll weevil, and it decided that cotton tasted much better than the other crops. Suddenly, the cotton farmers had a major boll weevil infestation. The drought helped to cause a long-term problem with boll weevils.\n* A drought occurred in 1910, and on January 24 geocentric Saturn was square Neptune. \n* A drought occurred in 1930, and on December 29, 1929 geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. \n* Geocentric Saturn was 135 degrees Neptune on February 21, 1931. A drought occurred in 1931.\n* The drought in 1933 was the famous Oklahoma Dust Bowl. On February 13, 1933, geo Saturn was inconjunct Neptune.\n\n== The Major Motors campaign ==\nFrom page 197 to 199, the book described how Robert traded the shares of a company called \u201cMajor Motors\u201d. It is in fact an alias for [[General Motors]], just as there is another company in the story called \u201cMajor Electric\u201d, which refers to [[General Electric]]. Quoting from page 197:\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, June 19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely. On this day he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured that Major Motors would decline until about June 30th and then start an advance which would last until about September 16th, 1927, when the Company would be 19 years old and at that time the stock would reach final high and would then go down to February to April, 1929. He figured that the stock should advance to around 270 by September 16th and made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if it went down around June 30th, and then start buying the stock.\u201d\n\n=== Detailed trades and their astrological aspects ===\nBonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> detailed the exact trades and their related astrological aspects as below, including both lunar aspects and transits to the GM incorporation chart on 17 Sep 1908:  (* Note: the transits with Pluto below are crossed out, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Action\n!Astrological Aspects\n!Lunar Aspects\n|-\n|30 Jun 1927\n|Buy GM @ 192.50\nMajor Bottom\n|G Sun 150 N ASC\nG Sun 30 N Venus\n\nG Sun 90 N Saturn\n\nG Venus 30 N MC\n\nG Mars 30 N Mars\n|G Moon max North\nOne day after total solar eclipse\n|-\n|15 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 204\nStart pyramid\n|G Sun 135 N ASC \nG Mars 30 N MC\n\nG Jupiter 0 Uranus\n|G Moon max South\nFull Moon\n|-\n|21 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 214\n|G Mars 135 N Uranus \n|G Moon 0 North\nQuarter Moon\n|-\n|26 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 224\n|G Mercury 135 N ASC \nG Mars 0 N Jupiter\n|G Moon max North\n|-\n|5 Aug 1927\n|GM up to 230\nRaised stop to 225\n|G Mars 90 N ASC\nG Saturn SD\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|8 Aug 1927\n|Stop loss was hit\n|G Venus 75 N ASC\nG Venus 0 South\n|\n|-\n|12 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 218\n|G Venus 0 N MC\nG Jupiter 0 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Leo\n|Full Moon\n|-\n|20 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 228\n|G Venus SR\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|24 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 238\n|G Mercury 105 N ASC\nG Sun 0 N Jupiter\n\nG Sun Virgo\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|26 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 248\n|G Venus 0 N MC\n|New Moon\n|-\n|7 Sep 1927\n|GM is at 253\n|''<s>G Pluto 0 N Neptune *</s>'' \nG Mercury 0 Venus\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|14 Sep 1927\n|Buy GM @ 258\n|G NN 90 N Sun\nG Mars 0 South\n\nG Mars 180 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Libra\n|G Moon 0 North\n|-\n|16 Sep 1927\n|Sell GM @ 272\nBirthday of GM\n|G Sun 0 N Sun\nG Mercury 0 South\n\nG Uranus 0 South\n|\n|}\nRegarding this plethora of astrological aspects, Hill only had the following to comment:\n* A major bottom occurs when geocentric Sun is square natal Saturn. \n* Gann sells when geocentric Sun is conjunct the natal Sun, and two planets are at zero South declination. \nOther than that, she did not go further to separate the wheat from the chaff, and delineate how other traders could apply this cluster of seemingly unrelated aspects to their trading.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nGann strongly hinted at the astrological influence when he stated that Major Motors\u2019 share price would rise during this period because of \u201ca new and great discovery of a time factor\u201d which would make the price to stop declining \u201cabout June 30th\u201d. Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Mysteries of Gann Analysis Unveiled!|last=Ferrera|first=Daniel T.|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara: CA|pages=}}</ref> noted that there was [[Solar eclipse of June 29, 1927|a total solar eclipse on 29th June, 1927]], and Saturn was going [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]]. By the middle of September that year, Saturn had turned direct and returned to its spot during the eclipse. Also, this total eclipse fell with the Sun Square to natal Saturn. This is a seemingly very negative aspect, but Ferrera explains that the Natal Saturn was retrograde, and when a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed that good aspects such as trines and sextiles become negative and bad aspects such as squares & oppositions become positive.\n\nFerrera also pointed out that, prior to the first trade on 30 Jun 1927, the total lunar eclipse on 15 Jun created some negative transits, because the Moon was in exact opposition to natal Pluto, and the Sun Square to the natal Sun. This is why Gann expected the price to decline into 30 Jun 1927 (except that, of course, Gann could not have been aware of Pluto, as it was discovered in 1930).\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles and the Hexagon chart ===\nAs James Smithson noted,<ref name=\":3\" /> Robert forecasted that Major Motor's share price would rise between June 30 and September 16, 1927 due to positive astrological influences. This is a period of 78 days, during which he forecast that the price would rise from 192\u00bd to 270, which rounds up to 78 points. After a rise of 78 points in 78 days (i.e. 1\u00d71 [[Gann angles|Gann angle]]) time and price would be squared and the uptrend would end. Similarly, Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\"/> noted that the bottom price of $192\u00bd is in opposition to Jupiter & Uranus on the Gann Hexagon Chart, whereas the final price of $270 conjoins Jupiter and Uranus on the same chart, a complete 180\u00b0 movement.\n\n== The cotton campaign ==\nFrom page 195 to 197, the book goes into details how Robert traded cotton in 1927. Quoting from page 195 of the book: \u201cAfter Robert had sold out his October cotton at 17.30 and his December cotton at 17.50 on June 10th, he decided to watch the market very closely for a few days because he thought it would go lower. His forecast indicated last buying level around June 25th. He figured that after this time the market would go higher until September 5th to 6th, when he figured it would be final high.\u201d\n\n=== Relationship to the Wet Cotton Farmer rule ===\nAs indicated in the previous section, Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> noted that Uranus was inconjunct with Neptune in that Spring, which would predict that a flood was coming and the cotton price would go up.\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\" /> found that the support line is related to the 1\u00d71 angle whereas the resistance is related to the 4\u00d71 angle.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.timingsolution.com/TS/Articles/Peter_gardon/index.htm|title=Analysis of Robert Gordon\u2019s trades, from the book Tunnel Thru The Air - Part 1|last=Palaskas|first=Peter|date=|website=Timing Solution|access-date=17 Feb 2018}}</ref> found that the entry dates are related to the two solar eclipses on 3rd Jan and 29th Jun 1927.\n\n== Declination of major planets ==\nIn addition to the ecliptic longitude, cycles are also found by declination of the planets.<ref name=\":0\" /> On page 79, Gann wrote, \u201cHistory shows that in 916 agriculture in the British Isles was at its lowest ebb and that there was great scarcity of wheat and corn. Very few people were engaged in tilling the soil on account of wars. The same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in 1916 and 1917, when this country was called on to furnish food to starving Europe and send men and money to save their armies from defeat.\u201d Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> explained that the common factor in 916 and 1916 is that geocentric Saturn was at maximum North declination in March. Since Saturn's sidereal year is 29.457 years, it is very uncommon for it to be at maximum North declination in March. Like the weather rules above, the astrological \u201csign\u201d occurs in the spring.\n\nAlso, on page 202, Gann discussed the great bull market from 1924 through 1927, \u201cHe went back into the stock market and in the great Coolidge Bull Campaign from 1924 to 1927 was again a dominant factor in General Motors and other stocks and was reputed to have made fifty millions, or more.\u201d Checking the geocentric ephemeris, and Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> found that in March\u2013April 1924, geocentric Jupiter was at max South declination, and geocentric Uranus in South declination during all of 1924. On July 8, 1927 geocentric Jupiter was at 0 North declination, and on May 1, 1927, geocentric Uranus was at 0 North declination. The declination of both planets was \u201cincreasing\u201d during the 1924-1927 bull market.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tunnel Thru the Air, The}}\n[[Category:1927 American novels]]\n[[Category:1927 science fiction novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Tunnel Thru the Air, Or, Looking Back from 1940''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel written by market forecaster [[William Delbert Gann]] in 1927.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Financial Guardian Publishing Company|year=1927|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/tunnelthruairorl00gann|title=The tunnel thru the air; or, Looking back from 1940|website=The Internet Archive|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/The_Tunnel_Thru_the_Air_Or_Looking_Back.html?id=1eRcta9cBocC|title=The Tunnel Thru the Air, Or, Looking Back from 1940|website=Google Books|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref> In the Foreword, Gann hinted that this book is more than just a novel because it \"contains a valuable secret, clothed in veiled language.

The story began in the late evening of 9 June 1906, when the protagonist Robert Gordon was born. The early part of the book is mostly about the early life of Robert, including how he found and lost his true love, Marie Stanton, who was born on 6 October 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ytemagazine.com/w-d-ganns-mundane-seasonal-cycles-d-k-burton/|title=W.D.

However, the war in the book was from 1930 to 1932, whereas the Second World War started about ten years later. Therefore, unless Gann was making a very serious mistake, he could not be referring to it.

Gann (1927)|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> believes that the title of the book is an anagram. He replaced the \u201c1940\u201d in the title with the following letters:\n* The number \u201c0\u201d is replaced by the letter \u201cO\u201d.\n* The remaining numbers 1, 4, 9 are worked in the following ways:\n** 1 x 9 x 4 = 36, 3 x 6 = 18, and the 18th letter is \u201cR\u201d\n** 1 & 9 are \u201c19\u201d, and the 19th letter is \u201cS\u201d\n** 9 + 4 = 13, and the 13th letter is \u201cM\u201d\nHe rearranged the letters, and the title became \u201cFrom the Lunar Return, Looking back to His Mother\u201d. Amundsen noted that Marie disappeared on 5 June 1927, when the Moon was in Leo, and she reappeared on 30 August 1932, when the Moon was in Leo again.\n\nHe also noted that the date of the Foreword was 9 May 1927, which was 1940 days before the end of the novel, 30 August 1932.\n\n=== Book cover ===\nThe original 1927 book cover depicts some planes flying around a tunnel in the sky. Paul Nipperess<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gann.su/book/eng/11998.pdf|title=Introduction to Gann Signs|last=Nipperess|first=Paul|date=2004|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> notices that the number and location of planes displays some [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci relationships]].\n\n=== Fake quotes ===\nThere are a number of quotes in the book which are unclear if they are really said or written by the person.<ref name=\":6\" /> For example, on page 191, Gann \u201cquoted\u201d [[Pythagoras]] in the following passage: \u201c\u2018There are in woman\u2019s eyes two sorts of tears, the one of grief; the other of deceit.\u2019 I think that is because there are two kinds of men, one who appreciates love and honor and gives sympathy; the other kind who is selfish, expects something for nothing and must meet with deceit.\u201d Brian Sklenka<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> thinks that Gann was trying to draw the readers\u2019 attention to the Pyathagoras, and the numbers \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cone\u201d, indirectly hinting that the [[Octave|octave theory]] discovered by the Greek philosopher.\n\nSimilarly, on page 192, Gann included the following \u201cquote\u201d from [[Robert Southey|Southey]], \u201cThere are three things a wise man will not trust, the wind, the sunshine of an April day and a woman\u2019s plighted faith.\u201d Again, it is an association of the British poet and the number \u201cthree\u201d, which is an indirect reference to his famous story [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]. Some esoteric writers like S. J. Pasagic<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Whisper|last=Pasagic|first=S. J.|publisher=RoseDog Books|year=2011|isbn=9781434975454|location=Pittsburgh, PA|pages=}}</ref> believes that the story is a hidden reference to the Law of Three (see [[Fourth Way#Basis of teachings|the teachings of George Gurdjieff]]).\n\n=== Page numbers ===\nMany believe that Gann used the pages numbers in the 1927 original edition to encode some of his secrets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://technical-analysis-addins.com/trading-gann-smithson.php|title=James Smithson on WD GANN|last=Smithson|first=James|date=2016|website=XL Trader|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rosecast.com/learn-astrology-with-the-tunnel-thru-the-air/|title=Learn Astrology with \"The Tunnel Thru the Air\"|last=Rosecast School of Financial Astrology|website=Rosecast|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref> Here are some examples that the page number is related to the information on that page:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Page Number\n!Content of the Page\n!Remarks\n|-\n|12\n|This is a part of Chapter 2 in which Robert's mother expressed that \u201cBobbie had advanced ideas fully a hundred years ahead of his time and that he should be educated and allowed to follow his own ideas\u201d.\n|The page number (12) to the chapter number (2) is 144.

It turns out that all dates related to this incident are related to the positions of Venus, Mars and the Moon:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n# Texarkana, June 5, 1927, 3 am. The moment of parting Marie and Robert. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer, the Moon at the time of the onset of the event in 28 degrees of Cancer. \n# Paris, late February 1929. The illusion of meeting Robert and Marie. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer on a heliocentric chart. Moon Return on the geo-map. \n# New York, August 30, 1932, 11 am. Meeting Robert and Marie. Lunar return. The connection of Mars and Venus is very close to Cancer.\n\n== Weather forecasting along the Mississippi River ==\nIn 1994, retired engineer Bonnie Lee Hill did a public seminar in which she revealed some astrological methods concealed in the Tunnel Thru the Air.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of the trading rules used by Gann are related to the weather in the area around the [[Mississippi River]], and they are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rule (as coined by Hill)\n!Planets\n!Time Window\n!Aspect Formed\n!Details\n!Implication in Cotton Prices\n|-\n|Wet Cotton Farmer\n|[[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Before mid-April of each calendar year\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Multiples of the 8th (45\u00b0) or 12th (30\u00b0) harmonic\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River will flood in that year.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|-\n|Poor Cotton Farmer\n|[[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the rainfall along the Mississippi will be ideal to grow crops.\n|The supply would increase and the price would fall.\n|-\n|Dry Cotton Farmer\n|[[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River area will experience horrible drought.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|}\nThe last rule (\"Dry Cotton Farmer\") was actually not mentioned at all in the book. It was deduced by Hill after she discovered the first two rules. Here are some actual examples from Hill's lecture:\n\n=== Wet Cotton Farmer (Uranus-Neptune) ===\n* In 1735, geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune. Over ninety percent of New Orleans was under water. The entire region was drastically affected by the flooding in the Delta.\n* In 1762, geocentric Uranus 135\u00b0 with Neptune. This was a major flood. For instance,the flood level in the city of Cincinnati was up 80 feet. The top of a church steeple was the only thing sticking out of the water in the little town of Cincinnati.\n* In 1821 (geocentric Uranus conjunct Neptune), we had another major flood. They called it the \u201cworst flood of the century\u201d. The reporters said that they had no words to describe the damage from this flood. They couldn't even estimate the cost of the damage. People decided give major sections of land back to the Mississippi River. They would not farm the land, and they would not build towns on the land. The people realized that the Mississippi River would always \u201cwin\u201d.\n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1881 (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune). Please notice that we had a major flood in 1881, and another major flood in 1882. Due to retrogradation, we had the same aspect (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune) on Feb 26, 1881 and April 8, 1882. There are cases in which we had major floods three years in a row because the same aspect occurred in the spring of all three years. The floods in 1881-1882 were very famous. Mark Twain was alive during that time. He actually went down the Mississippi River on a steam boat, and said the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide at that time. The channel of the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide. \n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1907 (geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune). This is the flood mentioned by Gann in The Tunnel Thu the Air. Please notice that we had a flood in 1907, and in 1908. Why? The same aspect occurred in the spring of both years. \n* The next big flood occurred in 1927 (geocentric Uranus 150 Neptune). This is the one that Gann predicts in The Tunnel Thru the Air. They had a late spring and a major flood. There was over $284 million in damage. It was estimated that 240 billion gallons of water came down the Mississippi River that spring. They had 1.8 million acres of land under water. A lot of people feel that this was one of the major causes of the Great Depression; the flood destroyed the economy through the Mississippi basin. This totally destroyed the cotton crops.\n* The next major flood occurred in 1935 (geocentric Uranus 135 Neptune). The same aspect occurred in the spring of 1936, and a second flood occurred. The flood in 1936 caused $270 million in damage.\n* In 1943, geocentric Uranus trine Neptune. A major flood occurred which caused $172 million in damage. In 1973, we saw geocentric Uranus semi-square Neptune. A major flood caused $420 million of damage. October cotton hit a high price of 99 cents at this time. In 1979, a major flood occurred. Geocentric Uranus was semi-sextile Neptune on March 31, 1979.\n* In 1993, geocentric Uranus was conjunct Neptune on February 2. What happened in 1993? The same thing that occurred in 1821, approximately 173 years earlier. Once again, the Mississippi River looks like an inland lake. Many, many acres are under water and they are currently discussing buying the land from the farmers, giving it back to the river, and saying we won't grow crops there again and we won't build buildings there again. The ticket for this flood at the time of the seminar was $12 billion.\n\n=== Poor Cotton Farmer (Jupiter-Neptune) ===\n* In 1844, cotton had an extreme low of 5 cents a pound. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 27, 1844. Since this is rain during the growing season, you will find this class of aspects can happen a little later in the season. It's not required that they be more like January or February. They can be more like March\u2013April.\n* On March 2, 1851, geocentric Jupiter was 135 degrees from Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 8.25 cents in January 1852.\n* On April 7, 1857, geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 9.25 cents in January 1858.In 1871, cotton hit the lowest low it had ever hit since 1860 (13.50 cents). \n* On April 8, 1871, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune. In 1873, cotton hit another major low of 13.80. Geocentric Jupiter was trine Neptune on March 3, 1873.\n* Cotton hit another major low (6.20 cents) in 1896. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-square Neptune on February 26, 1896.\n* Geocentric Jupiter was square Neptune on March 14, 1904. This was a major low in cotton prices. On July 19, cotton sold for 6.85. The cotton farmers were so disgusted that they burned the cotton in the fields. They did not even go to the effort of harvesting it. Hundreds of cotton farmers abandoned their farms and left. It was not worth cotton farming again. No one would ever want cotton ever again. They gave up.\n* Very low cotton prices occurred in 1920. Geocentric Jupiter was conjunct Neptune on March 8, 1920.\n* On April 17, 1926, geocentric Jupiter was opposite Neptune. In March 1927, cotton hit a low of 11.80. The government reports showed a record crop.\n* Cotton hit a major low of 25.20 cents in December 1970. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 29, 1970.Cotton hit a major low of 26.59 in December 1972. \n* On March 10, 1972, geocentric Jupiter was again semi-sextile Neptune.Cotton hit a major low of 29.99 in July\u2013August 1986. \n* On March 16, 1986, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune.\n\n=== Dry Cotton Farmer (Saturn-Neptune) ===\n* In 1761, we had a major drought in the country. Geo Saturn was 135 degrees from Neptune on April 13, 1761. The next year, geo Saturn was again 135 degrees from Neptune on February 6, 1792. We had another major drought in 1762.\n* On April 13, 1816, geocentric Saturn was sextile Neptune. There was a major drought and crop failure in 1816.\n* On January 14, 1860, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The year 1860 is famous for the Kansas drought. Hundreds of people moved to Kansas tostart over. They planned to start farming, and make a fortune. Many of these farmers gave up and left Kansas after the drought of 1860. They said you just can't make it in Kansas. \n* On March 11, 1863, geocentric Saturn was opposite Neptune. There was a major drought. Cotton hit the highest price it had ever seen 91 cents. That is 91 cents in 1863 dollars. Why was cotton so high? First, there was a major drought. Second, the Civil War was disrupting the economy. \n* On February 1, 1869, geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. In 1869, cotton hit a high of 35 cents before a huge decline in price.\n* On January 31, 1903, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The drought was so severe that cotton farmers planted their crops in a different manner. There was a little bug that grew in certain crops, and the farmers planted those crops next to the cotton. This little bug was called the boll weevil, and it decided that cotton tasted much better than the other crops. Suddenly, the cotton farmers had a major boll weevil infestation. The drought helped to cause a long-term problem with boll weevils.\n* A drought occurred in 1910, and on January 24 geocentric Saturn was square Neptune. \n* A drought occurred in 1930, and on December 29, 1929 geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. \n* Geocentric Saturn was 135 degrees Neptune on February 21, 1931. A drought occurred in 1931.\n* The drought in 1933 was the famous Oklahoma Dust Bowl. On February 13, 1933, geo Saturn was inconjunct Neptune.\n\n== The Major Motors campaign ==\nFrom page 197 to 199, the book described how Robert traded the shares of a company called \u201cMajor Motors\u201d. It is in fact an alias for [[General Motors]], just as there is another company in the story called \u201cMajor Electric\u201d, which refers to [[General Electric]]. Quoting from page 197:\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, June 19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely. On this day he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured that Major Motors would decline until about June 30th and then start an advance which would last until about September 16th, 1927, when the Company would be 19 years old and at that time the stock would reach final high and would then go down to February to April, 1929. He figured that the stock should advance to around 270 by September 16th and made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if it went down around June 30th, and then start buying the stock.\u201d\n\n=== Detailed trades and their astrological aspects ===\nBonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> detailed the exact trades and their related astrological aspects as below, including both lunar aspects and transits to the GM incorporation chart on 17 Sep 1908:  (* Note: the transits with Pluto below are crossed out, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Action\n!Astrological Aspects\n!Lunar Aspects\n|-\n|30 Jun 1927\n|Buy GM @ 192.50\nMajor Bottom\n|G Sun 150 N ASC\nG Sun 30 N Venus\n\nG Sun 90 N Saturn\n\nG Venus 30 N MC\n\nG Mars 30 N Mars\n|G Moon max North\nOne day after total solar eclipse\n|-\n|15 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 204\nStart pyramid\n|G Sun 135 N ASC \nG Mars 30 N MC\n\nG Jupiter 0 Uranus\n|G Moon max South\nFull Moon\n|-\n|21 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 214\n|G Mars 135 N Uranus \n|G Moon 0 North\nQuarter Moon\n|-\n|26 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 224\n|G Mercury 135 N ASC \nG Mars 0 N Jupiter\n|G Moon max North\n|-\n|5 Aug 1927\n|GM up to 230\nRaised stop to 225\n|G Mars 90 N ASC\nG Saturn SD\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|8 Aug 1927\n|Stop loss was hit\n|G Venus 75 N ASC\nG Venus 0 South\n|\n|-\n|12 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 218\n|G Venus 0 N MC\nG Jupiter 0 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Leo\n|Full Moon\n|-\n|20 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 228\n|G Venus SR\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|24 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 238\n|G Mercury 105 N ASC\nG Sun 0 N Jupiter\n\nG Sun Virgo\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|26 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 248\n|G Venus 0 N MC\n|New Moon\n|-\n|7 Sep 1927\n|GM is at 253\n|''<s>G Pluto 0 N Neptune *</s>'' \nG Mercury 0 Venus\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|14 Sep 1927\n|Buy GM @ 258\n|G NN 90 N Sun\nG Mars 0 South\n\nG Mars 180 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Libra\n|G Moon 0 North\n|-\n|16 Sep 1927\n|Sell GM @ 272\nBirthday of GM\n|G Sun 0 N Sun\nG Mercury 0 South\n\nG Uranus 0 South\n|\n|}\nRegarding this plethora of astrological aspects, Hill only had the following to comment:\n* A major bottom occurs when geocentric Sun is square natal Saturn. \n* Gann sells when geocentric Sun is conjunct the natal Sun, and two planets are at zero South declination. \nOther than that, she did not go further to separate the wheat from the chaff, and delineate how other traders could apply this cluster of seemingly unrelated aspects to their trading.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nGann strongly hinted at the astrological influence when he stated that Major Motors\u2019 share price would rise during this period because of \u201ca new and great discovery of a time factor\u201d which would make the price to stop declining \u201cabout June 30th\u201d. Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Mysteries of Gann Analysis Unveiled!|last=Ferrera|first=Daniel T.|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara: CA|pages=}}</ref> noted that there was [[Solar eclipse of June 29, 1927|a total solar eclipse on 29th June, 1927]], and Saturn was going [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]]. By the middle of September that year, Saturn had turned direct and returned to its spot during the eclipse. Also, this total eclipse fell with the Sun Square to natal Saturn. This is a seemingly very negative aspect, but Ferrera explains that the Natal Saturn was retrograde, and when a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed that good aspects such as trines and sextiles become negative and bad aspects such as squares & oppositions become positive.\n\nFerrera also pointed out that, prior to the first trade on 30 Jun 1927, the total lunar eclipse on 15 Jun created some negative transits, because the Moon was in exact opposition to natal Pluto, and the Sun Square to the natal Sun. This is why Gann expected the price to decline into 30 Jun 1927 (except that, of course, Gann could not have been aware of Pluto, as it was discovered in 1930).\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles and the Hexagon chart ===\nAs James Smithson noted,<ref name=\":3\" /> Robert forecasted that Major Motor's share price would rise between June 30 and September 16, 1927 due to positive astrological influences. This is a period of 78 days, during which he forecast that the price would rise from 192\u00bd to 270, which rounds up to 78 points. After a rise of 78 points in 78 days (i.e. 1\u00d71 [[Gann angles|Gann angle]]) time and price would be squared and the uptrend would end. Similarly, Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\"/> noted that the bottom price of $192\u00bd is in opposition to Jupiter & Uranus on the Gann Hexagon Chart, whereas the final price of $270 conjoins Jupiter and Uranus on the same chart, a complete 180\u00b0 movement.\n\n== The cotton campaign ==\nFrom page 195 to 197, the book goes into details how Robert traded cotton in 1927. Quoting from page 195 of the book: \u201cAfter Robert had sold out his October cotton at 17.30 and his December cotton at 17.50 on June 10th, he decided to watch the market very closely for a few days because he thought it would go lower. His forecast indicated last buying level around June 25th. He figured that after this time the market would go higher until September 5th to 6th, when he figured it would be final high.\u201d\n\n=== Relationship to the Wet Cotton Farmer rule ===\nAs indicated in the previous section, Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> noted that Uranus was inconjunct with Neptune in that Spring, which would predict that a flood was coming and the cotton price would go up.\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\" /> found that the support line is related to the 1\u00d71 angle whereas the resistance is related to the 4\u00d71 angle.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.timingsolution.com/TS/Articles/Peter_gardon/index.htm|title=Analysis of Robert Gordon\u2019s trades, from the book Tunnel Thru The Air - Part 1|last=Palaskas|first=Peter|date=|website=Timing Solution|access-date=17 Feb 2018}}</ref> found that the entry dates are related to the two solar eclipses on 3rd Jan and 29th Jun 1927.\n\n== Declination of major planets ==\nIn addition to the ecliptic longitude, cycles are also found by declination of the planets.<ref name=\":0\" /> On page 79, Gann wrote, \u201cHistory shows that in 916 agriculture in the British Isles was at its lowest ebb and that there was great scarcity of wheat and corn. Very few people were engaged in tilling the soil on account of wars. The same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in 1916 and 1917, when this country was called on to furnish food to starving Europe and send men and money to save their armies from defeat.\u201d Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> explained that the common factor in 916 and 1916 is that geocentric Saturn was at maximum North declination in March. Since Saturn's sidereal year is 29.457 years, it is very uncommon for it to be at maximum North declination in March. Like the weather rules above, the astrological \u201csign\u201d occurs in the spring.\n\nAlso, on page 202, Gann discussed the great bull market from 1924 through 1927, \u201cHe went back into the stock market and in the great Coolidge Bull Campaign from 1924 to 1927 was again a dominant factor in General Motors and other stocks and was reputed to have made fifty millions, or more.\u201d Checking the geocentric ephemeris, and Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> found that in March\u2013April 1924, geocentric Jupiter was at max South declination, and geocentric Uranus in South declination during all of 1924. On July 8, 1927 geocentric Jupiter was at 0 North declination, and on May 1, 1927, geocentric Uranus was at 0 North declination. The declination of both planets was \u201cincreasing\u201d during the 1924-1927 bull market.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tunnel Thru the Air, The}}\n[[Category:1927 American novels]]\n[[Category:1927 science fiction novels]]\n", "name_user": "Victor CWT", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEncoding techniques:added some info", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tunnel_Thru_the_Air;_Or,_Looking_Back_from_1940"}

It is the centre of India's [[glassmaking]] industry and is known for the quality of the bangles and also glasswares produced there.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Akbar]], revenue was brought through the city, which was looted by the afghans.

Several trains serve the city connecting it to long and short distanced destinations including [[New Delhi]], [[Howrah]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kanpur]], [[Lucknow]], [[Jaipur]], [[Jammu Tawi]], [[Amritsar]], [[Jamshedpur]], [[Patna]], [[Aligarh]], [[Agra]], [[Hathras]], [[Puri]], [[Ajmer]], [[Ambala]], [[Bareilly]], [[Mathura]], [[Etawah]], [[Gorakhpur]] and [[Tundla]].\n\n[[Tundla Junction|Tundla Junction railway station]] in the [[Tundla]] town (20&nbsp;km west of Firozabad city on [[National Highway 2 (India)|National Highway 2]]) of the Firozabad District is a major railway station of [[North Central Railways]]. Due to its proximity to Agra several trains on the Delhi Howrah route which don't stop at Firozabad station make a stop at [[Tundla]] Junction hence serving Firozabad as well as [[Agra]] cities. \n* 20801/02 [[Magadh Express]] \n* 14217/18 [[Unchahar Express]]\n* 15483/84 [[Mahananda Express]]\n* 12311/12 [[Kalka Mail]]\n*18101/02 [[Muri Express]]\n*12419/20[[Gomti Express]]\n*14163/64[[Sangam Express]]\n*13483/84[[Farakka Express]]\n*15707/08[[Amrapali Express]]\n*14723/24[[Kalindi Express]]\n*12875/76[[Neelachal Express]]\n*12395/96[[Ziyarat Express]] \n*18631/32[[Gareeb Nawaz Express]] \n*13007/08[[Udhyan Abha toofan Express]] \n*12179/08[[Lucknow intercity Express]]\n*19037/38[[Bandra Terminus Gorakhpur Avadh Express]] \n\nThe city is 45&nbsp;km east from Agra on [[National Highway 19 (India)|National Highway 19]] which makes it an important stopover for the transport vehicles on this highway. Firozabad hence is connected to several bus services to the Western and Eastern parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state. Due to proximity to [[Agra]] and hence the borders of Uttar Pradesh with [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] states several inter-state bus services also serve the city. Intra-city transport typically consists of [[Rickshaws]] and [[Auto rickshaw|3-wheelers]]\n\nThe City is well connected with [[Yamuna Expressway]] and [[Taj Expressway]] to national capital [[New Delhi]] and state capital [[Lucknow]] respectively.\n\n==Water problem==\nSince few years, Firozabad has been suffering with a severe water pollution problem. The water has been polluted by the indiscriminate discharge of wastes by the industries, causing a literal water \"crisis\". The water has been tendered practically unusable. Citizens have no option but to install water purifiers at home and use packaged drinking water for consumption.\nPeople have installed water purifiers and have summers installed in their home.<ref>http://www.icontrolpollution.com/articles/physicochemical-characteristics-of-glass-industries-waste-water-in-firozabad-district-up-india.pdf</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-family-of-six-attempts-suicide-after-facing-acute-water-scarcity/articleshow/69917025.cms</ref><ref>https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/11Sep201505090522.pdf</ref>\n\n==Air pollution==\nAir pollution by Firozabad's industries have been held responsible among other contributors for the corrosion of the famous Taj Mahal's white marble, due to acid rain and polluted air. Firozabad was then added as part of Taj Trapezium in 1996, which banned the use of coal/ coke in industries located there, the introduction to Gas Pipeline from [[Gas Authority of India Limited]] in the glass industries have reduced it to some extent.\n\n==Market==\n\nShastri Market located in heart of city, is a main shopping market in Firozabad where you can get all sort of shopping items. \nRaniwala Market is also a market located in the heart of city. The market owned entirely by Raniwalas, the family which also owns 6 Jain temples in the city. Raniwala trust is one of the prominent trusts in the city.\n\n==Industry==\n\n===Glass industry===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\nDuring ancient times, invaders brought many glass articles to India. These glass articles when rejected, were collected and melted in locally made furnaces called \"Bhainsa Bhatti.\" In this furnace, wood was used as a fuel. These old traditional furnaces are still in use in [[Sasani]] near [[Aligarh]] and at [[Purdal Nagar]] and were originally used only for making smaller bottles and [[bangle]]s. The glass industry specially the modern glass bangles technology was started and invented by Haji Rustam Ustad. The shrine of Haji Rustam Ustad is in Sofipura, a village on the bank of [[Yamuna River]]. His shrine is situated just opposite the shrine of famous sufi saint Shah Sufi. Every year a grand fair (mela) is held to pay homage to the father of Firozabad glass industry \"Haji Rustam Ustad\".This fair is attended by all people irrespective of caste, class or religion. By current production standards, only one bangle at a time can be made using these furnaces. These bangles had no joints and were locally known as  \"Kadechhal Ki Chudi\". Over time, production slowly became more widespread among the locals. This was the start of the glass industry in Firozabad. Since then Firozabad has been the home of India's glass industry. White and coloured glass pieces being manufactured for the purpose of assembling [[jhad]] and [[fanus]] (chandeliers) which were in demand by royal courts and nobles for decorating their assembling and drawing rooms. Later on phials for ''[[Itra]]'', scents, and other cosmetic products were made. Gradually, Indian marriage items like bangles, ''kangan''s, [[kara (Sikhism)|kada]], etc. too began to be produced in bulk for the general public. Today, there is area known as ''Bohran Gali'' that sells bangles, kadas, kangans and other items of suhagins (married women).\n\nSince 1989, Firozabad has produced artistic glassware in different colours and shades used in chandeliers and other items. About four hundred glass industries are registered in Firozabad, making different types of glass products. They use natural gas instead of coal. Half of the production of these units is exported. Nowadays, blowing/modeling is done by the [[Pot Furnace and Regenerative tank]] furnace in the factories.\n\nFirozabad with the changing time has entered into new era of Glass Manufacturing, it has become a major hub of manufacturing different Glass based items and has registered its global presence, diversifying its industrial base and encouraging ancillary industries including Chemicals, Packaging and more of service sector based industries have flourished in a short span of time.\n\nAll sorts of glass articles, including jars, candle stands, glasses, flower vases, and electric wares such as decorative lights, bulbs and every other sort of glass articles are prepared in this city. These articles are painted with vivid colours and innovative patterns. Etching is done on some products to enhance their beauty. Decoration work is also done on some products by fixing other material on them.\n\n== Tourist attractions==\n=== Lord Bahubali Jain Temple ===\nIn Suhag Nagari, holy center of \u201cJain Nagar\u201d was established by Lt.

These glass articles when rejected, were collected and melted in locally made furnaces called \"Bhainsa Bhatti.\" In this furnace, wood was used as a fuel. These old traditional furnaces are still in use in [[Sasani]] near [[Aligarh]] and at [[Purdal Nagar]] and were originally used only for making smaller bottles and [[bangle]]s. The glass industry specially the modern glass bangles technology was started and invented by Haji Rustam Ustad. The shrine of Haji Rustam Ustad is in Sofipura, a village on the bank of [[Yamuna River]]. His shrine is situated just opposite the shrine of famous sufi saint Shah Sufi. Every year a grand fair (mela) is held to pay homage to the father of Firozabad glass industry \"Haji Rustam Ustad\".This fair is attended by all people irrespective of caste, class or religion. By current production standards, only one bangle at a time can be made using these furnaces. These bangles had no joints and were locally known as  \"Kadechhal Ki Chudi\". Over time, production slowly became more widespread among the locals. This was the start of the glass industry in Firozabad. Since then Firozabad has been the home of India's glass industry. White and coloured glass pieces being manufactured for the purpose of assembling [[jhad]] and [[fanus]] (chandeliers) which were in demand by royal courts and nobles for decorating their assembling and drawing rooms. Later on phials for ''[[Itra]]'', scents, and other cosmetic products were made. Gradually, Indian marriage items like bangles, ''kangan''s, [[kara (Sikhism)|kada]], etc. too began to be produced in bulk for the general public. Today, there is area known as ''Bohran Gali'' that sells bangles, kadas, kangans and other items of suhagins (married women).\n\nSince 1989, Firozabad has produced artistic glassware in different colours and shades used in chandeliers and other items. About four hundred glass industries are registered in Firozabad, making different types of glass products. They use natural gas instead of coal. Half of the production of these units is exported. Nowadays, blowing/modeling is done by the [[Pot Furnace and Regenerative tank]] furnace in the factories.\n\nFirozabad with the changing time has entered into new era of Glass Manufacturing, it has become a major hub of manufacturing different Glass based items and has registered its global presence, diversifying its industrial base and encouraging ancillary industries including Chemicals, Packaging and more of service sector based industries have flourished in a short span of time.\n\nAll sorts of glass articles, including jars, candle stands, glasses, flower vases, and electric wares such as decorative lights, bulbs and every other sort of glass articles are prepared in this city. These articles are painted with vivid colours and innovative patterns. Etching is done on some products to enhance their beauty. Decoration work is also done on some products by fixing other material on them.\n\n== Tourist attractions==\n=== Lord Bahubali Jain Temple ===\nIn Suhag Nagari, holy center of \u201cJain Nagar\u201d was established by Lt.
