Downing had his premises on [[Chancery Lane]]. This location was spared from the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, but in December of the same year, Downing died. It is believed that Charles continued his apprenticeship under Cordelia Downing, Humphrey\u2019s wife, and later worked as a journeyman until he was freed through the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] (the 'Clockmakers' Company') on 3 June 1772.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes 3/6/1672 - MS2010/1.</ref> \n\nCharles Gretton established his first workshop on Fleet Street with John Johnson but in 1778 moved into his own premises, \u2018The Ship,\u2019 in the vicinity of [[Fleet Street]] and Fetter Lane.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

[http://www.grettonbook.com www.grettonbook.com].P.25 - 29.</ref> Gretton worked during the period which is often called \u2018The Golden Age of English Clockmaking,\u2019 when many innovations were created and the trade flourished. He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to King George I. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a journeyman for four years rather than the more customary two years. Sully then moved to France, becoming quite famous in the Continent and in Great Britain. Sully is remembered for his efforts to develop a sea going clock for determining longitude at sea.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age.P.522 - 533, 536 - 540.</ref> Charles Gretton was a prolific maker of clocks and watches for home and abroad. ''[http://www.grettonbook.com/home Charles Gretton: Clock and Watchmaking Through The Golden Age]'', published in 2016, lists 74 extant longcase clocks, 52 spring clocks, five [[Lantern clock|lantern clocks]] and 29 [[Watch|watches]], but more have been discovered since.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 577 - 591.</ref> \n\nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 419, 443 - 447.</ref> Gretton produced [https://www.lexico.com/definition/timepiece timepieces], [[mwod:clock watch|clock watches]], alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches (i.e., which contained [[Repeater (horology)|repeaters]]), and [[polychrome]] decorated watches with [https://anordain.com/blogs/news/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enamel-dials-part-1 enamel dials] and [[porcelain]] boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable with those from London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, ebony-veneered cases, and lacquer-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-striking control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter maintaining power.\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 279 - 281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 270 - 278.</ref>\n\n== The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers ==\nGretton was very active in the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]]. He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was chosen the Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>  Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the Bank of England in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of properties in the city and country. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref>  In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund. The last recorded recipient was in 1842. At least 77 boys were able to enter the clockmaking trade through this programme.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers records of Gretton's Gift, The Register of Apprentices of The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London from its Incorporation in 1631 to its Tercentenary in 1931, London: private printing for the Company 1931, Atkins, Charles Edward.

It is believed that this school for ten boys continued until 1823, more than 90 years after Gretton\u2019s death.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 63.</ref> This charity was financed by the rent on Gretton\u2019s workshop, The Ship, on Fleet Street, which was willed to his son Thomas.\n\n\u2018Gretton\u2019s Gift,\u2019 another donation to Claypole set out in his will, ended in the early 20th century.<ref>Lincolnshire Archives, Lincoln, Misc DON 1153.</ref> Gretton was a donating governor at Bridewell and Christ\u2019s Hospitals; both engaged in education and training, and both still exist as schools.\n\n== Civic Life ==\nGretton\u2019s civic appointments included being a Warden at St Dunstan-in-the-West. He also was a Common Councilman, representing the parish for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for Ludgate and for both precincts of St Dunstan-in-the-West.\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Their son Phillips attended St Paul\u2019s School, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, attaining his Doctor of Divinity degree at the latter.<ref>The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876, edited by Robert Gardiner. London, George Gardiner, 1884. P. 61.</ref> Phillips became the rector in Springfield, Essex, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Phillips was married in the newly completed St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, in March 1712/13.\n\nDaughter Ann married John Houghton, a glover. Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in Milk Street, London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew had become the rector.\n\nThomas, the youngest son, married Elizabeth Turner, a widow, but not much is known about him. The Ship was willed to Thomas, but \u00a310 of the yearly rent funded the charities for Claypole. Thomas was also buried in Springfield. In December 1698, Mary Gretton died, as did two of the children.\n\nCharles Gretton married Lucy Uffman in 1700, but she must have died, because Gretton married again in 1711, this time to Dorothea Wilson. Gretton became a widower for the third time 1727.\n\n== Death ==\nCharles Gretton died on 25 June 1731 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 5 July 1731. He had reserved \u00a3100 for his funeral costs and was buried \u2018in very decent manner,\u2019 according to a newspaper at the time.<ref>Daily Advertiser, 5 July 1731.</ref> Besides his beautiful clocks and watches, Charles left considerable wealth, including at least nine properties \u2014 quite a feat for a cottager\u2019s son with only two shillings\u2019 inheritance from his father.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nStevens, John J.

It is believed that Charles continued his apprenticeship under Cordelia Downing, Humphrey\u2019s wife, and later worked as a journeyman until he was freed through the Clockmakers\u2019 Company on 3 June 1772.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes 3/6/1672 - MS2010/1.</ref> \nCharles Gretton established his first workshop on Fleet Street with John Johnson but in 1778 moved into his own premises, \u2018The Ship,\u2019 in the vicinity of Fleet Street and Fetter Lane.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to King George I. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was Henry Sully, who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a journeyman for four years rather than the more customary two years. Sully then moved to France, becoming quite famous in the Continent and in Great Britain. Sully is remembered for his efforts to develop a sea going clock for determining longitude at sea.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age.P.522 - 533, 536 - 540.</ref> Charles Gretton was a prolific maker of clocks and watches for home and abroad. Charles Gretton: Clock  & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age, published in 2016, lists 74 extant longcase clocks, 52 spring clocks, five lantern clocks and 29 watches, but more have been discovered since.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 577 - 591.</ref> \nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 419, 443 - 447.</ref> Gretton produced timepieces, clock watches, alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches, and polychrome decorated watches with enamel dials and porcelain boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable with those from London's best makers. His early longcase clocks were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had parquetry decoration, followed by floral marquetry, arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, ebony-veneered cases, and lacquer-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-striking control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter maintaining power.\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or kingwood case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 279 - 281.</ref> \nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 270 - 278.</ref>\n\n== The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers ==\nGretton was very active in the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]]. He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was chosen the Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>   Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the Bank of England in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of properties in the city and country. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref>  In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund. The last recorded recipient was in 1842. At least 77 boys were able to enter the clockmaking trade through this programme.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers records of Gretton's Gift, The Register of Apprentices of The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London from its Incorporation in 1631 to its Tercentenary in 1931, London: private printing for the Company 1931, Atkins, Charles Edward.

It is believed that this school for ten boys continued until 1823, more than 90 years after Gretton\u2019s death.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age.

He also was a Common Councilman, representing the parish for many years. \nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for Ludgate and for both precincts of St Dunstan-in-the-West.\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Their son Phillips attended St Paul\u2019s School, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, attaining his Doctor of Divinity degree at the latter.<ref>The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876, edited by Robert Gardiner. London, George Gardiner, 1884. P. 61.</ref> Phillips became the rector in Springfield, Essex, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Phillips was married in the newly completed St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, in March 1712/13.\nDaughter Ann married John Houghton, a glover. Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in Milk Street, London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew had become the rector. \nThomas, the youngest son, married Elizabeth Turner, a widow, but not much is known about him. The Ship was willed to Thomas, but \u00a310 of the yearly rent funded the charities for Claypole. Thomas was also buried in Springfield. In December 1698, Mary Gretton died, as did two of the children. \nCharles Gretton married Lucy Uffman in 1700, but she must have died, because Gretton married again in 1711, this time to Dorothea Wilson. Gretton became a widower for the third time 1727.\n\n'''Death:\nCharles Gretton died on 25 June 1731 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 5 July 1731. He had reserved \u00a3100 for his funeral costs and was buried \u2018in very decent manner,\u2019 according to a newspaper at the time.<ref>Daily Advertiser, 5 July 1731.</ref> Besides his beautiful clocks and watches, Charles left considerable wealth, including at least nine properties \u2014 quite a feat for a cottager\u2019s son with only two shillings\u2019 inheritance from his father.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nStevens, John J.

The town was formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[County Durham]], the town was subsumed into the metropolitan borough of Gateshead in 1974. It lies on the [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B1426]] Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass, less than {{convert|1|mi}} east of [[Gateshead]] town centre, {{convert|1|mi}} south east of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and 10 miles north west of the [[City of Sunderland]]. In 2011, Felling had a population of 8,908.\n\nThe history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years. The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the [[Brandling of Newcastle|Brandling]] family in 1509. While [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]], several members of this family served as [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing [[heavy industry]] to the area, and Felling Colliery (John Pit), one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt [[Sir Humphry Davy]] and [[George Stephenson]] to develop their [[safety lamps]] (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling, administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that Felling council were responsible for were Felling, High Felling, Windy Nook, Whitehills Estate, Leam-Lane Estate, Pelaw, Wardley, Heworth, Bill Quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.\n\nFelling today is broadly residential save some [[light industry]] located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] line and there are stations at [[Gateshead Stadium Metro station|Gateshead Stadium]] and [[Felling Metro station|Felling]]. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a \u00a313.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old [[Co-op]] supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new [[Asda]] superstore. The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen [[listed buildings]], several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. [[Gateshead International Stadium]] lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international [[Chris Waddle]], as does award-winning author [[David Almond]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and, in 1920, was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled.<ref>Mawer, 1920: 83\u201384</ref> Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide tree felling, it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means \"the people of\". In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling \"to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight\".<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22\">Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22</ref> The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden.<ref>Surtees, 1820: 85</ref> In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by [[Lewis de Beaumont|Bishop Lewis Beaumont]], who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1422.<ref>Surtees, 1820: 86</ref> The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died.<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22\"/>\n\nThere followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate, which also included [[Low Dinsdale Manor]] near [[Darlington]], was contested between the families Brandling, a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family, Blaxton and Wyclyffe.<ref name=\"Newman, 1993: 56\">Newman, 1993: 56</ref><ref>Surtees, 1820: 86\u201387</ref> While several elements of the estate where divided by share, in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by [[Deed]] of [[Partition (law)|Partition]] to Robert Brandling and his heirs \"for life and to the total extinction\" of any other claims.<ref name=\"Surtees, 1820: 87\">Surtees, 1820: 87</ref>\n\n===The Brandling family===\n\nBrandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne. He became sheriff of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in 1524, was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the [[Duke of Somerset]] at Mussleburgh. When he died in 1568, the estate passed to his brother Thomas.<ref>Mackenzie, 1825: 470</ref> In 1605, Thomas' grandson, [[Robert Brandling]], inherited the manor. Robert Brandling was granted [[Newminster Abbey]] by King James in 1810, served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] for [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]].<ref>Hodgson, 1832: 414</ref> When he died in 1636, the estate passed to his son, [[Francis Brandling|Sir Francis Brandling]]. Francis was also an MP, albeit for [[Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Northumberland]], between 1824\u201325 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at [[Alnwick Abbey]].<ref name=\"Surtees, 1820: 87\"/><ref>Browne Willis, 1750: 192</ref> He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling, a [[cavalry]] [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick. Charles had two brothers. The older of which, Ralph, was killed at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]],<ref>Burke, 1852: 136</ref> while the second brother, Robert, also participated in the [[English Civil War]] and was captured in an otherwise successful [[Royalist]] engagement at [[Corbridge]] in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the [[Roundheads]]; an action which earned him the reputation as \"a very knave\" which he carried until his death in 1669.<ref name=\"Newman, 1993: 56\"/>\n\n===Early industrialisation 1680\u20131800===\n\nBy the turn of the 18th century, Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\">Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1</ref> However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began [[drift mining]] around 1670.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\"/><ref>Namier, 1995: 113</ref> He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\"/> At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the [[River Tyne]]; the first such works to be developed on the river.<ref name=\"Lewis, 1848: 227\">Lewis, 1848: 227</ref><ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24\">Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24</ref> Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling,<ref group=note>Charles Brandling (1733\u20131802) was another member of the family who became an MP, this time for [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], in 1784.

As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.<ref>Baldwin, 1823: 503\u201304</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing the first blast at 11:30, rescue attempts started at 12:15.  At 14:00 the second blast occurred and no further rescues occurred.<ref name=Hodgson1999/>  Some 29 men were saved, but the remaining 92 men and boys were killed.<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22\"/>  Two days later the decision was made to seal the colliery to starve the fire of oxygen.<ref name=Hodgson1999/>  Just one year later, on 24 December 1813, a further catastrophe occurred:\n\n<blockquote>About half-past one o'clock on the morning, an explosion took place in Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred at the time of calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.<ref>Richardson, 1844</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2012/05/26/parade-for-the-felling-pit-victims-72703-31050419/|title=Parade for the Felling pit victims|author=Katie Davies|publisher=Newcastle Evening Chronicle|date=26 May 2012}} (Retrieved 2 August 2012)</ref>\n\n===The Industrial Revolution===\n\n[[File:Coal Staithes, Felling Shore.jpg|thumb|The coal staithes at Felling Shore.]] [[File:Felling old OS1.gif|thumb|An ordnance survey map of High and Low Felling in 1862]]In spite of the disaster, Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially. There now existed three distinct villages. Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling; a residential village in the township of [[Heworth, Tyne and Wear|Heworth]] which had attracted several [[Wesleyan]] and [[Methodist]] preachers.<ref name=\"Whellan, 1856: 804\">Whellan, 1856: 804</ref> Slightly to the north lay Low Felling.

A Methodist church was built there in 1805. This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay, coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built.<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24\"/><ref name=\"Whellan, 1856: 804\"/> Industry continued to flourish here; the copperworks established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded, an oil and a paper mill had also developed, along with forging works for anchors and shovels.<ref name=\"Lewis, 1848: 227\"/>\n\nIn 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham.

By 1860, improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline. This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock, which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 5</ref> At around the same time, the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] was matched by continuous residential growth, so that by the [[Victorian era]] those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged.<ref>GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.2</ref>\n\nAt 10:52&nbsp;am on 26 March 1907, an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station.<ref name=\"Druitt, 1907: 68\">Druitt, 1907: 68</ref> The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink.<ref>Druitt, 1907: 70</ref> The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.<ref name=\"Druitt, 1907: 68\"/>\n\nThe decline of heavy industry, meanwhile, continued apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict, leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/> Felling Colliery, the oldest and most extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/>\n\nIn place of industry came housing. The high density terraced housing which had accompanied the industrial boom of the 19th century had sprawled south and was soon joined by a wave of development at the run of the 20th century.<ref name=\"GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.3\">GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.3</ref>  The earlier housing came at Stuart Street, Temple Street and Helmsdale Avenue in the form of [[Tyneside flat]]s.<ref>GVA, 2006: 13 at para. 2.9</ref> In the inter-war years, whole derelict industrial areas were cleared and large council estates of semi-detached houses, with front and back gardens, were built at the Old Fold, Stoneygate, Brandling and Nest estates.<ref name=\"GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.3\"/><ref>GVA, 2006: 13 at para. 2.10</ref> By the time that Felling ceased to be an independent town and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1974, Felling had become a \"dormitory area\" and remains so today.<ref>Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 8</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Crowhall Lane, Felling (geograph 1965957).jpg|right|thumb|View along Felling Town Centre]]\nThere are two principal economic areas in Felling. The first of these is at Felling Shore, where the East Gateshead Riverside Park was built in 1966 and which, combined with the Felling Shore industrial estate, today houses 241 businesses employing around 6,400 people.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/> The second is in central Felling in the town centre area around Victoria Square. The town centre has seen massive investment over recent years, with the complete redevelopment of the main shopping centre and addition of a new [[Asda]] superstore, a [[Greggs]] bakery, [[Card Factory]] shop, Subway sandwich outlet and a local taxi business. Other amenities include a [[Post Office]], [[Heron Foods]] store and several [[bookmakers]], as well as 4 [[public houses]] and [[fast food]] outlets <ref>NPSD, 2006: 44\u201345 at para. 4.39</ref><ref>NPSD, 2006: 45 at para. 4.43</ref>\n\nThe Felling Health Care Centre is the main source of General Healthcare for the town's population, and houses St Alban's medical group and Crowhall Medical Group. The GP surgery also has a small Boots pharmacy in addition to the larger Boots store in the town centre.\n\nFelling has one small dentist practice located on the B1426 main commuter road that connects Heworth to Gateshead town centre\n\nLevels of unemployment in Felling are high. Only 52.4% of the total working age population are in employment, as compared to 61.7% in the borough overall. Around 10% of residents claim [[Jobseeker's Allowance]]; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough.<ref>FWF, 2012: 2</ref> Youth unemployment levels are also very high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead. The average income of residents is only \u00a318,000 per annum; this compares to a Gateshead average of \u00a327,000 and is the lowest figure in the borough.<ref>FWF. 2012: 3</ref>\n\n==Geography and topography==\n\n[[File:Felling Shore - geograph.org.uk - 1132758.jpg|thumb|Felling shore, where the north of Felling meets the [[River Tyne]]]]\nFelling, at latitude 54.950\u00b0 N and longitude 1.564\u00b0 W, lies less than {{convert|1|mi}} south and east of [[Gateshead]] town centre on a bed of carboniferous sandstone and clay, interspersed with coal measures laid down around 300 million years.<ref>Hewitt (part two), 1990: 2</ref>  It is split bilaterally by the [[A184 road (England)#Triple-digit roads|Felling By-Pass]]<ref name=\"NPSD, 2006: 30 at para. 2.96\">NPSD, 2006: 30 at para. 2.96</ref> to the north and by Sunderland Road more centrally.<ref>GE06, 2008: 4</ref> The distance from Felling to London is {{convert|255|mi}}.\n\nThe urban expansion of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries difficult to define.

of [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], England. The town was formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[County Durham]], the town was subsumed into the metropolitan borough of Gateshead in 1974. It lies on the [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B1426]] Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass, less than {{convert|1|mi}} east of [[Gateshead]] town centre, {{convert|1|mi}} south east of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and 10 miles north west of the [[City of Sunderland]]. In 2011, Felling had a population of 8,908.\n\nThe history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years. The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the [[Brandling of Newcastle|Brandling]] family in 1509. While [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]], several members of this family served as [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing [[heavy industry]] to the area, and Felling Colliery (John Pit), one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt [[Sir Humphry Davy]] and [[George Stephenson]] to develop their [[safety lamps]] (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling, administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that Felling council were responsible for were Felling, High Felling, Windy Nook, Whitehills Estate, Leam-Lane Estate, Pelaw, Wardley, Heworth, Bill Quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.\n\nFelling today is broadly residential save some [[light industry]] located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] line and there are stations at [[Gateshead Stadium Metro station|Gateshead Stadium]] and [[Felling Metro station|Felling]]. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a \u00a313.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old [[Co-op]] supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new [[Asda]] superstore. The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen [[listed buildings]], several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. [[Gateshead International Stadium]] lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international [[Chris Waddle]], as does award-winning author [[David Almond]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and, in 1920, was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled.<ref>Mawer, 1920: 83\u201384</ref> Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide tree felling, it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means \"the people of\". In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling \"to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight\".<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22\">Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22</ref> The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden.<ref>Surtees, 1820: 85</ref> In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by [[Lewis de Beaumont|Bishop Lewis Beaumont]], who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1422.<ref>Surtees, 1820: 86</ref> The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died.<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22\"/>\n\nThere followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate, which also included [[Low Dinsdale Manor]] near [[Darlington]], was contested between the families Brandling, a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family, Blaxton and Wyclyffe.<ref name=\"Newman, 1993: 56\">Newman, 1993: 56</ref><ref>Surtees, 1820: 86\u201387</ref> While several elements of the estate where divided by share, in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by [[Deed]] of [[Partition (law)|Partition]] to Robert Brandling and his heirs \"for life and to the total extinction\" of any other claims.<ref name=\"Surtees, 1820: 87\">Surtees, 1820: 87</ref>\n\n===The Brandling family===\n\nBrandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne. He became sheriff of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in 1524, was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the [[Duke of Somerset]] at Mussleburgh. When he died in 1568, the estate passed to his brother Thomas.<ref>Mackenzie, 1825: 470</ref> In 1605, Thomas' grandson, [[Robert Brandling]], inherited the manor. Robert Brandling was granted [[Newminster Abbey]] by King James in 1810, served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] for [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]].<ref>Hodgson, 1832: 414</ref> When he died in 1636, the estate passed to his son, [[Francis Brandling|Sir Francis Brandling]]. Francis was also an MP, albeit for [[Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Northumberland]], between 1824\u201325 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at [[Alnwick Abbey]].<ref name=\"Surtees, 1820: 87\"/><ref>Browne Willis, 1750: 192</ref> He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling, a [[cavalry]] [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick. Charles had two brothers. The older of which, Ralph, was killed at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]],<ref>Burke, 1852: 136</ref> while the second brother, Robert, also participated in the [[English Civil War]] and was captured in an otherwise successful [[Royalist]] engagement at [[Corbridge]] in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the [[Roundheads]]; an action which earned him the reputation as \"a very knave\" which he carried until his death in 1669.<ref name=\"Newman, 1993: 56\"/>\n\n===Early industrialisation 1680\u20131800===\n\nBy the turn of the 18th century, Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\">Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1</ref> However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began [[drift mining]] around 1670.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\"/><ref>Namier, 1995: 113</ref> He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area.<ref name=\"Hewitt part three, 1990: 1\"/> At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the [[River Tyne]]; the first such works to be developed on the river.<ref name=\"Lewis, 1848: 227\">Lewis, 1848: 227</ref><ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24\">Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24</ref> Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling,<ref group=note>Charles Brandling (1733\u20131802) was another member of the family who became an MP, this time for [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], in 1784.

As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.<ref>Baldwin, 1823: 503\u201304</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing the first blast at 11:30, rescue attempts started at 12:15.

The accident occurred at the time of calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.<ref>Richardson, 1844</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2012/05/26/parade-for-the-felling-pit-victims-72703-31050419/|title=Parade for the Felling pit victims|author=Katie Davies|publisher=Newcastle Evening Chronicle|date=26 May 2012}} (Retrieved 2 August 2012)</ref>\n\n===The Industrial Revolution===\n\n[[File:Coal Staithes, Felling Shore.jpg|thumb|The coal staithes at Felling Shore.]] [[File:Felling old OS1.gif|thumb|An ordnance survey map of High and Low Felling in 1862]]In spite of the disaster, Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially. There now existed three distinct villages. Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling; a residential village in the township of [[Heworth, Tyne and Wear|Heworth]] which had attracted several [[Wesleyan]] and [[Methodist]] preachers.<ref name=\"Whellan, 1856: 804\">Whellan, 1856: 804</ref> Slightly to the north lay Low Felling.

A Methodist church was built there in 1805. This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay, coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built.<ref name=\"Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24\"/><ref name=\"Whellan, 1856: 804\"/> Industry continued to flourish here; the copperworks established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded, an oil and a paper mill had also developed, along with forging works for anchors and shovels.<ref name=\"Lewis, 1848: 227\"/>\n\nIn 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham.

By 1860, improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline. This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock, which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 5</ref> At around the same time, the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] was matched by continuous residential growth, so that by the [[Victorian era]] those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged.<ref>GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.2</ref>\n\nAt 10:52&nbsp;am on 26 March 1907, an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station.<ref name=\"Druitt, 1907: 68\">Druitt, 1907: 68</ref> The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink.<ref>Druitt, 1907: 70</ref> The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.<ref name=\"Druitt, 1907: 68\"/>\n\nThe decline of heavy industry, meanwhile, continued apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict, leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/> Felling Colliery, the oldest and most extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/>\n\nIn place of industry came housing.

The first of these is at Felling Shore, where the East Gateshead Riverside Park was built in 1966 and which, combined with the Felling Shore industrial estate, today houses 241 businesses employing around 6,400 people.<ref name=\"chroniclelive1\"/> The second is in central Felling in the town centre area around Victoria Square. The town centre has seen massive investment over recent years, with the complete redevelopment of the main shopping centre and addition of a new [[Asda]] superstore, a [[Greggs]] bakery, [[Card Factory]] shop, Subway sandwich outlet and a local taxi business. Other amenities include a [[Post Office]], [[Heron Foods]] store and several [[bookmakers]], as well as 4 [[public houses]] and [[fast food]] outlets <ref>NPSD, 2006: 44\u201345 at para. 4.39</ref><ref>NPSD, 2006: 45 at para. 4.43</ref>\n\nThe Felling Health Care Centre is the main source of General Healthcare for the town's population, and houses St Alban's medical group and Crowhall Medical Group. The GP surgery also has a small Boots pharmacy in addition to the larger Boots store in the town centre.\n\nFelling has one small dentist practice located on the B1426 main commuter road that connects Heworth to Gateshead town centre\n\nLevels of unemployment in Felling are high. Only 52.4% of the total working age population are in employment, as compared to 61.7% in the borough overall. Around 10% of residents claim [[Jobseeker's Allowance]]; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough.<ref>FWF, 2012: 2</ref> Youth unemployment levels are also very high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead.

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nThe film contains several historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nEmma Prentiss claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their badges, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nGeorge Godley exclaims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nFrederick Abberline is depicted as having been transferred to Whitechapel as a form of punishment. In fact, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having previously worked there for fourteen years from 1873-1887.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nThe film contains several historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nEmma Prentiss claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene.

The Admiralty converted her to a storeship shortly after her capture and fitting. She participated at the siege of Acre in 1799 with the result that her crew qualified for the Naval General Service Medal issued in 1847. She was sold in 1802.\n\n== Dutch service ==\nIn 1795, French cavalry captured ''Alliantie'' during the French [[capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder]]. In February 1795, she received a French crew, but probably remained too undermanned to be serviceable. In May, the [[Batavian Republic]] signed a peace and alliance treaty with France, and the French returned ''Alliantie'' against payment.{{sfnp|Demerliac|2004|p=199, \u21161513}}\n\n==Capture==\nOn 22 August 1795 a squadron of four British [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]]s consisting of {{ship|French frigate|Reunion|1786|2}}, {{HMS|Stag|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Isis|1774|2}}, and {{HMS|Vestal|1779|2}}, encountered two frigates and a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] from the [[Dutch Navy|Navy]] of the Batavian Republic. The engagement was fought off the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coastal island of [[Eiger\u00f8ya]], then in [[Denmark-Norway|Danish Norway]].\n\nAt 16:15 the leading British ship, ''Stag'', under Captain [[Joseph Sydney Yorke]], caught and engaged the rearmost Batavian ship, ''Alliante''; the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the Batavian squadron. For an hour ''Alliante'' held out against the more powerful ''Stag'' but eventually [[striking the colours|struck]]. The remainder of the Batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate {{ship|Dutch frigate|Argo||2}}, safely reaching Eiger\u00f8ya.<ref name=LG13809>{{London Gazette|issue=13809|page=896|date=29 August 1795}}</ref>\n{{main|Action of 22 August 1795}}\n\nCasualties on ''Stag'' numbered four men killed and 13 wounded; Dutch casualties on ''Alliantie'' are unknown. ''Alliante'' sailed to Britain under the command of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of ''Stag''.<ref name=LG13809/> ''Alliante'' was subsequently taken to [[Spithead]] where the [[Admiralty]] purchased her for the Royal Navy as the frigate HMS ''Alliance''.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}}\n\n==British service==\nThe British fitted ''Alliance'' at [[Sheerness]] and [[Deptford]]. She had arrived at [[Sheerness Dockyard]] to be fitted on 24 September 1795, was launched on 15 October and sailed on 7 December 1795. The Admiralty registered her on 25 November 1795. She was commissioned as a [[storeship]] of 22 guns in December under Commander William Cuming (or Cumming).{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}}\n\nCumming received promotion to [[post captain]] on 13 October 1797.<ref>Norie (1827), p.92.</ref> His replacement on ''Alliance'' was Commander Henry Heathcote, who was appointed in August.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}} He received promotion to post captain on 5 February 1798.<ref>Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, p.123.</ref>\n\n''Alliance'' underwent fitting at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]] in February and March, with Commander John Baker Hay assuming command of her in March.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}} He sailed her to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in June. On 2 February 1799 she was with Captain Sir [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge's]] squadron as they arrived at [[Alexandria]]. Troubridge and his squadron left [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] for Alexandria, with Sir [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] in {{ship|French ship|Tigre|1793|2}} replacing them. In March Commander David Wilmot replaced Hay. On 24 March, ''Alliance'' arrived at Acre with orders from Troubridge to discharge her cargo and return immediately. When Wilmot arrived at Acre, Smith quoted the [[Articles of War#Royal Navy|Articles of War]] to the effect that His Majesty's ships were required to assist a known friend in need; he commandeered ''Alliance'' while Wilmot agreed with enthusiasm.{{sfnp|Shankland|1975|p=70}}\n\n{{main|Siege of Acre (1799)}}\n\nIn the first week of April a gale forced ''Tigre'' to stand off, but Smith reported ''Alliance'' and the gun-vessels he had captured, all except one, rode out the gale.<ref name=LG15164/> Smith anchored ''Tigre'' and {{HMS|Theseus|1786|6}}, one on each side of the town, so their broadsides could assist the defence. ''Alliance'' and the gun-vessels were of shallower draft and so could come in closer. Together, they helped repel repeated French assaults.{{sfnp|Shankland|1975|p=70}}\n\nHowever, Wilmot received a fatal shot through the neck from a rifleman on 8 April as Wilmot mounted a howitzer on the breach in the wall at Acre. Additionally, the day before ''Alliance'' had three men wounded.<ref name=LG15164>{{London Gazette|issue=15164|pages=765\u2013766|date=30 July 1799}}</ref> The French attacked multiple times between 19 March and 10 May before [[Napoleon]] finally gave up. On 21 May he destroyed his siege train and retreated back to Egypt, having lost 2,200 men dead, 1,000 of them to the plague.{{sfnp|Pawley|2006|p=6}}\n\nSmith sailed with his squadron on 12 June.

The Admiralty converted her to a storeship shortly after her capture and fitting. She participated at the siege of Acre in 1799 with the result that her crew qualified for the Naval General Service Medal issued in 1847. She was sold in 1802.\n\n== Dutch service ==\nIn 1795, French cavalry captured ''Alliantie'' during the French [[capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder]]. In February 1795, she received a French crew, but probably remained too undermanned to be serviceable. In May, the [[Batavian Republic]] signed a peace and alliance treaty with France, and the French returned ''Alliantie'' against payment.{{sfnp|Demerliac|2004|p=199, \u21161513}}\n\n==Capture==\nOn 22 August 1795 a squadron of four British [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]]s consisting of {{ship|French frigate|Reunion|1786|2}}, {{HMS|Stag|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Isis|1774|2}}, and {{HMS|Vestal|1779|2}}, encountered two frigates and a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] from the [[Dutch Navy|Navy]] of the Batavian Republic. The engagement was fought off the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coastal island of [[Eiger\u00f8ya]], then in [[Denmark-Norway|Danish Norway]].\n\nAt 16:15 the leading British ship, ''Stag'', under Captain [[Joseph Sydney Yorke]], caught and engaged the rearmost Batavian ship, ''Alliante''; the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the Batavian squadron. For an hour ''Alliante'' held out against the more powerful ''Stag'' but eventually [[striking the colours|struck]]. The remainder of the Batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate {{ship|Dutch frigate|Argo||2}}, safely reaching Eiger\u00f8ya.<ref name=LG13809>{{London Gazette|issue=13809|page=896|date=29 August 1795}}</ref>\n{{main|Action of 22 August 1795}}\n\nCasualties on ''Stag'' numbered four men killed and 13 wounded; Dutch casualties on ''Alliantie'' are unknown. ''Alliante'' sailed to Britain under the command of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of ''Stag''.<ref name=LG13809/> ''Alliante'' was subsequently taken to [[Spithead]] where the [[Admiralty]] purchased her for the Royal Navy as the frigate HMS ''Alliance''.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}}\n\n==British service==\nThe British fitted ''Alliance'' at [[Sheerness]] and [[Deptford]]. She had arrived at [[Sheerness Dockyard]] to be fitted on 24 September 1795, was launched on 15 October and sailed on 7 December 1795. The Admiralty registered her on 25 November 1795. She was commissioned as a [[storeship]] of 22 guns in December under Commander William Cuming (or Cumming).{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}}\n\nCumming received promotion to [[post captain]] on 13 October 1797.<ref>Norie (1827), p.92.</ref> His replacement on ''Alliance'' was Commander Henry Heathcote, who was appointed in August.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}} He received promotion to post captain on 5 February 1798.<ref>Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, p.123.</ref>\n\n''Alliance'' underwent fitting at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]] in February and March, with Commander John Baker Hay assuming command of her in March.{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=210}} He sailed her to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in June. On 2 February 1799 she was with Captain Sir [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge's]] squadron as they arrived at [[Alexandria]]. Troubridge and his squadron left [[Acre]] for Alexandria, with Sir [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] in {{ship|French ship|Tigre|1793|2}} replacing them. In March Commander David Wilmot replaced Hay. On 24 March, ''Alliance'' arrived at Acre with orders from Troubridge to discharge her cargo and return immediately. When Wilmot arrived at Acre, Smith quoted the [[Articles of War#Royal Navy|Articles of War]] to the effect that His Majesty's ships were required to assist a known friend in need; he commandeered ''Alliance'' while Wilmot agreed with enthusiasm.{{sfnp|Shankland|1975|p=70}}\n\n{{main|Siege of Acre (1799)}}\n\nIn the first week of April a gale forced ''Tigre'' to stand off, but Smith reported ''Alliance'' and the gun-vessels he had captured, all except one, rode out the gale.<ref name=LG15164/> Smith anchored ''Tigre'' and {{HMS|Theseus|1786|6}}, one on each side of the town, so their broadsides could assist the defence. ''Alliance'' and the gun-vessels were of shallower draft and so could come in closer. Together, they helped repel repeated French assaults.{{sfnp|Shankland|1975|p=70}}\n\nHowever, Wilmot received a fatal shot through the neck from a rifleman on 8 April as Wilmot mounted a howitzer on the breach in the wall at Acre. Additionally, the day before ''Alliance'' had three men wounded.<ref name=LG15164>{{London Gazette|issue=15164|pages=765\u2013766|date=30 July 1799}}</ref> The French attacked multiple times between 19 March and 10 May before [[Napoleon]] finally gave up.
