The Cowboys' defense, however, kept Oklahoma State in the game long enough for their offense to wake up against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. J.W. Walsh threw for 135 yards and ran for another 125 and a touchdown to lead Oklahoma State to a 21\u20133 win over Mississippi State in the Texas Kickoff in Houston\u2019s Reliant Stadium.\n\nWalsh finished 18 of 27 after relieving starter Clint Chelf on the Cowboys' third series. Jeremy Smith rushed for 102 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries for Oklahoma State (1\u20130), which piled up 432 yards on offense after struggling for most of the first half.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s [[Tyler Russell]] finished 10 of 16 for 133 yards before being helped off the field and taken to the locker room in the third quarter after being brought down on a scramble. [[Dak Prescott]] replaced Russell, throwing for 89 yards on seven of 17 passing. [[LaDarius Perkins]] rushed for 50 yards on 16 carries and caught three passes for 52 yards for the Bulldogs (0\u20131), which had only 333 yards of offense and had trouble keeping drives going, finishing two of 16 on third down conversions. Oklahoma State's defense also had three sacks and intercepted two Mississippi State passes.\n\nMississippi State marched down the field in 57 yards on 13 plays taking over six minutes off the clock, but the Bulldogs were only able to get Devon Bell's 40-yard field goal to take a 3\u20130 lead. Russell was 5 of 7 on the drive for 58 yards. Oklahoma State's offense gained only 67 yards with less than four minutes remaining in the first half before Walsh got going. Walsh worked the quarterback keeper three times for gains of 46 yards down the left sideline, 12 yards down the left sideline to the MSU 3 and capping it off with a 3-yard touchdown run to give the Cowboys a 7\u20133 lead with 2:16 left in the half. The Bulldogs looked to respond before the half as Jameon Lewis weaved the kickoff return 66 yards to the OSU 34, but a holding penalty and a sack by Tyler Johnson stopped the drive.\n\nOSU continued the offensive momentum in the second half, driving 75 yards in 11 plays to take a 14\u20133 lead on a Smith 1-yard run with 10:41 left in the third. Smith tacked on a 20-yard touchdown run to begin the fourth quarter to up the lead to 21\u20133.\n\n===Alcorn State===\n{{See also|Alcorn State Braves football|2013 Alcorn State Braves football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Alcorn State at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Braves\n|V1= 0|V2= 0|V3= 0|V4= 7\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1= 14|H2= 23|H3= 7|H4= 7\n|Date= September 7\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 2:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:00\n|Attendance=55,085\n|Weather= {{convert|92|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Mostly sunny, winds SE 2mph\n|Referee= Dan Romeo\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Mike Morgan (broadcaster)|Mike Morgan]], [[Cole Cubelic]] and Paul Carcaterra\n|TVStation= [[Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast|CSS]]\n}} Source:<ref name=AlcornStategamestats>{{cite web|title=Alcorn State Braves at Mississippi State Bulldogs (September 7, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms0907.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=9:22 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=6:16 |Team=MSU |Event=Derrick Milton 3-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=11:34 |Team=MSU |Event=Derrick Milton 14-yard touchdown pass from Dak Presscott, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 21\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 28\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:15 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 31-yard touchdown pass from Dak Presscott, Devon Bell kick failed|Score= MSU 34\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:58 |Team=MSU |Event=Devon Bell 26-yard kick good|Score= MSU 37\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=13:57 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=11:42 |Team=ASU |Event=Tollette George 25-yard touchdown pass from John Gibbs, Jr., Haiden McCraney kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:00 |Team=MSU |Event=Nick Griffin 10-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 51\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Mississippi State (1\u20131) didn't use several regular starters, including quarterback Tyler Russell, who suffered a concussion in the Bulldogs' season-opening loss to Oklahoma State. It didn't matter. The Bulldogs led 21\u20130 by early in the second quarter and 37\u20130 by halftime. It was the most points in the first half for the program since 1996. Mississippi State's Ashton Shumpert rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns. Nick Griffin added 54 yards on the ground and a touchdown.\n\nAlcorn State (1\u20131), which plays in the Football Championship Subdivision, managed just two first downs in the first three quarters. The Braves scored their only touchdown early in the fourth quarter on a 25-yard pass from John Gibbs Jr. to Tollete George.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 230-pound Prescott showed his poise early in the first quarter by converting two straight passes on 4th and 9 for a first down. The first was an 18-yard strike to Joe Morrow, but it was disallowed after officials ruled Alcorn State had called timeout. A sold out Davis Wade Stadium groaned, but Prescott came right back and hit Malcolm Johnson for a 23-yard gain. Two plays later, Prescott burst through the line for an 11-yard touchdown run and a 7\u20130 lead. The rout was just beginning. Mississippi State outgained Alcorn State 308\u201330 in total yards on the way to the huge halftime lead. Prescott completed 12 of 19 passes while also rushing for 20 yards and a touchdown. He didn't play in the second half.\n\nThe second half started just as lopsided. Brandon Holloway ran the kickoff back 95 yards to Alcorn's 1-yard line, and Mississippi State scored two plays later for a 44\u20130 lead with 13:57 left in the third quarter. Alcorn State's George finished with four catches for 80 yards and the Braves' only touchdown. Gibbs was 11 of 25 passing for 135 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\n===Auburn===\n{{See also|Auburn Tigers football|2013 Auburn Tigers football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Auburn\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1= 6 |V2= 7 |V3= 7 |V4= 0\n|Host='''Tigers'''\n|H1= 11 |H2= 3 |H3= 3 |H4= 7\n|Date= September 14\n|Location= [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]]<br>[[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn, AL]]\n|StartTime= 6:00 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:14\n|Attendance= 85,817\n|Weather= {{convert|78|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Sunny, winds NE 4mph\n|Referee= Matt Moore\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Mark Jones (sportscaster)|Mark Jones]], [[Brock Huard]] and Maria Taylor\n|TVStation= [[ESPN2 College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN2]]\n}} Source:<ref name=Auburngamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Auburn Tigers (September 14, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms0914.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=10:53 |Team=AU |Event=[[Cody Parkey]] 40-yard kick good|Score= AU 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:54 |Team=AU |Event=[[Quan Bray]] 76-yard touchdown pass from [[Nick Marshall]], Brandon Fulse pass from Ryan White|Score= AU 11\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:09 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 14-yard touchdown run, Nick Griffin rush failed|Score= AU 11\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=13:36 |Team=AU |Event=Cody Parkey 40-yard kick good|Score= AU 14\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:02 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 5-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= AU 14\u201313}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=12:38 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 2-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 20\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=9:53 |Team=AU |Event=Cody Parkey 47-yard kick good|Score= MSU 20\u201317}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=0:10 |Team=AU |Event=[[C.

Uzomah for an 11-yard touchdown with 10 seconds left to lift Auburn to a 24\u201320 victory over Mississippi State on Saturday night, ending the Tigers' 10-game Southeastern Conference losing streak. Marshall led the Tigers (3\u20130, 1\u20130 SEC) down the field with big running and passing plays in easily his best game. The junior-college transfer completed his first five passes for 55 yards in leading Auburn 88 yards over the final 1:56. He then ran 11 yards on 3rd-and-10 before lofting the decisive throw to the right corner of the end zone. The play was reviewed and instant replay officials ruled that the 6-foot-4 tight end, Uzomah, was pushed out of bounds, enabling him to come back.\n\nSubbing for an injured Tyler Russell for a second straight game, quarterback Dak Prescottran for 133 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 213 for Mississippi State (1\u20132, 0\u20131). Russell sustained a concussion in the opener against Oklahoma State.\n\nWith the game on the line, Marshall suddenly looked like anything but a guy who's had six weeks to learn an offense. He hit freshman Marcus Davis on three straight passes to cover 29 yards, then had a 17-yarder to Jaylon Denson. He also salvaged short gains with a couple of runs before heading out of bounds. [[Tre Mason]]'s 3-yard run pushed it to the 11 before Auburn called timeout with 15 seconds left.\nMarshall was 23-of-34 passing for 339 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted twice. He passed for just 246 yards and two TDs in his first two games as starter combined. Marshall showed a knack for turning potential miscues into big plays. He dropped the shotgun snap, collected it on the bounce and hit a wide-open Quan Bray downfield for a 76-yard touchdown on the opening drive. Ryan White then hit Brandon Fulse for the two-point conversion.\nIn the third quarter, Marshall caught his own batted pass and raced for a 37-yard gain. The Bulldogs forced the Tigers to settle for Cody Parkey's 47-yard field goal after Jamerson Love tackled Corey Grant for a loss. Parkey also had a 40-yarder and 19-yarder.\n\nThe Bulldogs were able to keep in check Auburn tailbacks Corey Grant, Tre Mason andCameron Artis-Payne, who had been the strength of the offense. Prescott completed 15 of 28 passes and carried 22 times. LaDarius Perkins gained 36 yards after he was one of seven starters held out of a route of FCS team Alcorn State.\n\nMississippi State coach Dan Mullen gambled on fourth-and-2 from his own 29 late, and Prescott delivered with a 3-yard gain. That enabled the Bulldogs to burn off another two minutes before punting, though they couldn't get another first down.

Prescott's diverse and efficient performance was matched by Jameon Lewis, who caught a 50-yard touchdown pass, rushed for an 8-yard touchdown and threw the 36-yard touchdown that Prescott caught on a trick play. Prescott was starting just his third career game. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound sophomore completed 13 of 21 passes.\n\nMississippi State (2\u20132) led 10\u20137 after the first quarter, but erupted for 35 points in the second quarter to take a 45\u20137 halftime lead. Troy (2\u20132) never recovered from the brutal second quarter. Corey Robinson, who is the NCAA's active leader in career passing yards, completed 15 of 25 passes for just 105 yards, one touchdown and one interception. It was the most points Mississippi State has scored in a game since 1994. The Bulldogs finished with 551 total yards.\n\nBesides Prescott and Lewis, Mississippi State didn't have many players with big individual numbers. That's because just about any Bulldog who touched the ball produced. Ten players caught a pass and nine had at least one rushing attempt.\n\nThe Troy-Mississippi State series has traditionally been close, with the Trojans even earning one of the biggest wins in school history against the Bulldogs in 2001.

It was the ninth and final time the two hooked up for a completion, and it proved to be the knockout blow. Mettenberger threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns, Beckham had 179 yards receiving and two touchdowns and No. 10 LSU blew past Mississippi State for a 59\u201326 victory.\n\nIt was a tight game for three quarters, but Mettenberger's touchdown to Beckham gave LSU a 38\u201326 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter and Mississippi State couldn't respond. LSU closed the game on a 31\u20130 run, including four touchdowns in the fourth quarter.\nMettenberger completed 25 of 29 passes in another impressive performance during the senior's breakout season. Beckham was his favorite target \u2013 but [[Jarvis Landry]] also caught eight passes for 96 yards. It was a nearly flawless performance, and helped erase some of the sting of last week's 44\u201341 loss to Georgia. LSU's Jeremy Hill added 157 yards rushing and two touchdowns while Kenny Hilliard added 39 yards rushing and three touchdowns. The Tigers (5\u20131, 2\u20131 Southeastern Conference) have won 14 straight over Mississippi State (2\u20133, 0\u20132) dating back to 1999. LSU has a 21\u20131 record under Miles following a loss.\n\nMississippi State's Dak Prescott threw for 106 yards and rushed for 103 more. Jameon Lewis caught seven passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. The Bulldogs' offense was good, especially early, but LSU's was even better. The Tigers' receiver duo of Landry and Beckham was unstoppable, even when Mississippi State appeared to have good coverage, and Mettenberger found them early and often. The Tigers finished with 563 total yards.\n\nLSU needed all those yards, because the defense was gashed for a second straight week. The Tigers gave up nearly 500 yards last week in a loss to Georgia and Mississippi State had some early success with a two-quarterback system. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Prescott has been terrific in Russell's place, providing much more of a running threat. On the team's first offensive drive, he rewarded Mullen's confidence with a 28-yard touchdown run to pull the Bulldogs to 7\u20136. Russell entered the game early in the second quarter and also had immediate success, throwing a 20-yard touchdown to Lewis to pull Mississippi State to 21\u201316 in the second quarter. The Bulldogs took a 23\u201321 lead on Russell's 59-yard touchdown pass to De'Runnya Wilson, but LSU responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Mettenberger to Beckham to take a 28\u201323 lead into halftime. Russell's second touchdown pass was the 39th of his career, which set a Mississippi State record. He finished 7 of 11 for 146 yards passing.\n\nThe teams combined for 608 total yards in the first half \u2013 334 for LSU and 274 for Mississippi State. LSU's defense tightened in the second half, giving up just three points.\n\n===Bowling Green===\n{{See also|Bowling Green Falcons football|2013 Bowling Green Falcons football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Bowling Green at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Falcons\n|V1=3|V2=10|V3=7|V4=0\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1=14|H2=7|H3=0|H4=0\n|Date= October 12\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:10\n|Attendance= 55,148\n|Weather= {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds light\n|Referee= Tom Ritter\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Bob Rathbun]], [[Tim Couch]] and [[Elizabeth Moreau]]\n|TVStation= [[Fox Sports Networks|SECRN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=BGSUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Bowling Green Falcons at Mississippi State Bulldogs (October 12, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1012.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=9:58 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:36 |Team=BGSU |Event=Tyler Tate 35-yard kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:24 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 75-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:15 |Team=BGSU |Event=Andre Givins 7-yard touchdown run, Tyler Tate kick good|Score= MSU 14\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:04 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 10-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:00 |Team=BGSU |Event=Tyler Tate 45-yard kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201313}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=3:57 |Team=BGSU |Event=Matt Johnson 2-yard touchdown run, Tyler Tate kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201320|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

After a failed fourth-and-1 by MSU, Bowling Green (5\u20132) had the ball and 4:21 on the clock at the end of the game, but couldn't get inside field goal range. Mississippi State (3\u20133) had 422 yards of offense, 245 on the ground as the Bulldogs won their 11th straight nonconference home game.\n\nThe game was a back-and-forth affair. Mississippi State opened the game on a 9-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a LaDarius Perkins touchdown. Bowling Green's BooBoo Gates intercepted Prescott on MSU's next offensive series, and the Falcons eventually settled for a 35-yard field goal by Tyler Tate. Prescott responded on the next drive by rushing for a 75-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Bowling Green answered with a 96-yard drive capped off by a 7-yardAndre Givens touchdown run. Mississippi State countered with a 75-yard drive and a 10-yard Prescott touchdown run with 1:04 left in the second quarter. But quarterback Matt Johnson worked Bowling Green into field goal range, and Tate nailed a 45-yarder to end the first half.\n\nTate missed a 45-yard field goal on the opening drive of the third quarter, but Bowling Green responded with a 7-play touchdown drive on its next possession, to pull within one point; the eventual final margin. With 4:21 left in the game, Mississippi State went for a fourth-and-1 on the Bowling Green six yard line. Prescott's rush was inches short, and the Bulldogs turned it over on downs. Johnson completed four passes and Green rushed once to get the Falcons to midfield. But then the drive stalled, and Johnson failed to complete a fourth-and-11 to Ryan Burbrink, and Mississippi State ran out the clock.\n\nFor MSU, Perkins rushed for 83 yards and one touchdown. Perkins, Joe Morrow and Jameon Lewis each caught four passes. Prescott was also 7-of-11 passing for 75 yards and one interception. Mullen again used both Prescott, a sophomore, and veteran quarterback Tyler Russell throughout the game. Russell finished 12-of-14 for 102 yards.\n\nJohnson was 19-of-33 for 194 yards for Bowling Green. Travis Green rushed for 99 yards and Ryan Burbrink caught four passes for a game-high 66 yards.

The Bulldogs had picked up their first Southeastern Conference victory of the season. But it wasn't easy at all. Mississippi State beat Kentucky 28\u201322 on Thursday night at Davis Wade Stadium. The Bulldogs built a 21\u20137 lead in the first half, but couldn't secure the game until Kentucky's last drive fell short at Mississippi State's 29 with 21 seconds left.\n\nDak Prescott threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns and also caught a 17-yard touchdown pass in another impressive all-around performance. He completed a career-high 23 of 34 passes and also rushed for 33 yards. Jameon Lewis had a 19-yard touchdown run, caught a 17-yard scoring pass and also threw the 17-yard touchdown to Prescott on a trick play. Mississippi State (4\u20133, 1\u20132 SEC) beat Kentucky (1\u20136, 0\u20134) for a fifth straight season. It's the second time this season Lewis has had rushing, receiving and passing touchdowns in a game. The 5-foot-9, 195-pound senior was a quarterback in high school and Mullen relishes his diverse skill set.\n\nKentucky's Joe Mansour made a 44-yard field goal with 8:15 remaining to pull the Wildcats to 28\u201322.\nMississippi State chewed up 6 minutes of clock the ensuing next drive, but Kentucky had one final chance. The Wildcats methodically moved downfield until Maxwell Smith's fourth-down pass missed its target and Mississippi State escaped.\n\nKentucky pulled to 21\u201319 in the third quarter on Jojo Kemp's 14-yard touchdown run. Then in what proved to be a key moment, the Wildcats recovered an onside kick, only to have it disallowed because of an offsides penalty. Mississippi State took advantage. A 74-yard drive ended on the halfback pass from Lewis to Prescott, who handed the ball off before leaking into the open field for the catch, touchdown and 28\u201319 lead. Prescott, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound sophomore, completed 11 of 18 passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, helping Mississippi State to a 21\u201310 halftime lead.\n\nPrescott's first touchdown pass \u2013 a 60-yard fling to a wide open Malcolm Johnson \u2013 came after he danced out of the pocket while avoiding a sack. Kentucky's defense shifted forward because of Prescott's ability to run, and it gave Johnson time to slip behind the secondary undetected. The Bulldogs had 296 total yards in the first half. Mississippi State started the game with the intention of using two quarterbacks, but Tyler Russell suffered a sprained ankle on his first series and never returned.\n\nKentucky's offense had a few good early moments \u2013 especially on a 51-yard screen pass from Smith to Timmons that tied the game at 7 \u2013 but the Wildcats became predictable because of their inability to throw downfield. Smith has dealt with pain in his throwing shoulder all season and wasn't close on most of his attempts to complete long passes. Kentucky's Smith completed 18 of 33 passes for 160 yards and one touchdown. Backup Jalen Whitlow led one touchdown drive, but was hampered because of a previous ankle injury. Raymond Sanders had 86 yards rushing.\n\nMississippi State safety Nickoe Whitley was ejected in the second quarter after earning two personal foul penalties over a span of four plays. The extra 30 yards greatly aided Kentucky on a drive that ended on a 45-yard field goal by Mansour.\n\n===#14 South Carolina===\n{{See also|South Carolina Gamecocks football|2013 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at South Carolina\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1=7|V2=3|V3=0|V4=6\n|Host='''Gamecocks'''\n|H1=14|H2=3|H3=17|H4=0\n|Date= November 2\n|Location= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]]<br>[[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia, SC]]\n|StartTime= 11:21 AM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:24\n|Attendance= 82,111\n|Weather= {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Sunny, winds W 5mph\n|Referee= Tom Ritter\n|TVAnnouncers= Dave Neal, [[Andre Ware]], and [[Cara Capuano]]\n|TVStation= [[SEC TV|SECTV]]\n}} Source:<ref name=USCgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at South Carolina Gamecocks (November 2, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1102.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=8:46 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 1-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=6:23 |Team=USC |Event=Shaq Roland 14-yard touchdown pass from [[Connor Shaw]], [[Elliott Fry]] kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=1:20 |Team=USC |Event=Shaq Roland 43-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 14\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=11:45 |Team=USC |Event=Elliott Fry 44-yard kick good|Score= USC 17\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:15 |Team=MSU |Event=Evan Sobiesk 38-yard kick good|Score= USC 17\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=12:54 |Team=USC |Event=[[Damiere Byrd]] 6-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 24\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:52 |Team=USC |Event=Jerell Adams 4-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 31\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=2:07 |Team=USC |Event=Elliott Fry 37-yard kick good|Score= USC 34\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:38 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Dak Prescott pass failed|Score= USC 34\u201316|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The Gamecocks (7\u20132, 5\u20132 SEC) got 20 points off the turnovers, including 10 in the third quarter as they went from a touchdown up to a 34\u201310 lead.\n\nShaw played quarterback just the way he always has \u2013 with an emphasis on results. He missed practice Monday and Tuesday with a virus and was not as sharp as usual. Still, the senior tied his career best with the four touchdown passes. He had scoring throws of 14 and 43 yards to Shaq Roland, 6 yards to Damiere Byrd and 4 yards to Jerell Adams to move to 23\u20135 as South Carolina's starting quarterback. Shaw can tie Todd Ellis' school record for victories when South Carolina plays Florida here in two weeks. Davis had 128 yards and became the Gamecocks' first 1,000-yard rusher since [[Marcus Lattimore]] ran for 1,197 yards his freshman season three years ago. South Carolina won its seventh in row over the Bulldogs (4\u20134, 1\u20133).\n\nPrescott threw three interceptions \u2013 he had just three in seven games coming in \u2013 and had a fumble. He did have touchdown runs of 1 and 11 yards, upping his SEC-leading touchdown total to 12.\n\nThe Gamecocks got themselves back in the SEC Eastern Division hunt with last week's 27\u201324, double-overtime victory at then No. 5 Missouri. South Carolina's home streak is the second current longest in the country behind Michigan's 19 in a row.\n\n===#11 Texas A&M===\n{{See also|Texas A&M Aggies football|2013 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Texas A&M\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1=7|V2=7|V3=6|V4=21\n|Host='''Aggies'''\n|H1=16|H2=7|H3=14|H4=14\n|Date= November 9\n|Location= [[Kyle Field]]<br>[[College Station, Texas|College Station, TX]]\n|StartTime= 2:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:53\n|Attendance= 88,504\n|Weather= {{convert|62|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Partly Cloudy, winds E 6mph\n|Referee= Ken Williamson\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Tim Brando]], [[Aaron Taylor (American football, born 1972)|Aaron Taylor]], and Kristina Akra\n|TVStation= [[SEC on CBS|CBS]]\n}} Source:<ref name=TAMUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Texas A&M Aggies (November 9, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1109.htm|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=5:45 |Team=TAMU |Event=Malcome Kennedy 12-yard touchdown pass from [[Johnny Manziel]], [[Josh Lambo]] kick good|Score= TAMU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Josh Robinson 51-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=1:28 |Team=TAMU |Event=Team Safety|Score= TAMU 9\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=0:11 |Team=TAMU |Event=[[Travis Labhart]] 33-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo  kick good|Score= TAMU 16\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:54 |Team=MSU |Event=De'Runnya Wilson 3-yard touchdown pass Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= TAMU 16\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:16 |Team=TAMU |Event=Travis Labhart 11-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo  kick good|Score= TAMU 23\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:34 |Team=TAMU |Event=Malcome Kennedy 21-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 30\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:44 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 12-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Dak Prescott pass intercepted|Score= TAMU 30\u201320}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:12 |Team=TAMU |Event=Trey 15-yard touchdown run, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 37\u201320}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=14:53 |Team=MSU |Event=Joe Morrow 33-yard touchdown pass from Jameon Lewis, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= TAMU 37\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=13:54 |Team=TAMU |Event=Nehemiah Hicks 2-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 44\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=10:54 |Team=TAMU |Event=[[Ben Malena]] 2-yard touchdown run, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 51\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=6:45 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 1-yard touchdown run, Dak Prescott rush|Score= TAMU 51\u201335}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=2:19 |Team=MSU |Event=De'Runnya Wilson 9-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Tyler Russell rush failed|Score= TAMU 51\u201341|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The crowd chanted \"one more year\" late in the game for Manziel, who is eligible for the draft after this season. Whether he comes back remains to be seen, but he went into the stands to celebrate with the student section when the game was over. Manziel denied that he even has entertained the thought that he might not play here again. Among the crowd of 88,504, third largest ever at A&M, on hand to see Manziel play at Kyle Field for the possibly final time was former President George H.W. Bush and former Texas A&M and current St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha. Texas governor Rick Perry was the co-pilot in the pre-game flyover and also attended the game. Manziel set a school career record for total yards with 9,040 and a single-season record with 31 touchdown passes. He became just the second A&M quarterback to run for 2,000 yards in a career and has 3,313 yards passing this year to become the first Aggie with two 3,000-yard passing seasons.\n\nMississippi State cut the lead to 10 points early in the fourth quarter, but Manziel threw his fifth touchdown pass to make it 44\u201327 for A&M (8\u20132, 4\u20132 Southeastern Conference). The defense grabbed an interception and Ben Malena's 2-yard touchdown run extended the lead to 51\u201327. Dak Prescott threw for 149 yards and two scores and ran for 154 yards for Mississippi State (4\u20135, 1\u20134). Kennedy and Travis Labhart had two touchdown receptions each. Mike Evans had 116 yards receiving to break the school single-season record with 1,263.\n\nRussell started the game in place of Prescott, who missed practice this week after his mother died of cancer on Sunday. Prescott entered the game on Mississippi State's third drive and got the majority of the snaps after that. Manziel evaded the rush and connected with Kennedy for a 21-yard touchdown to extend Texas A&M's lead to 30\u201314 in the third quarter. The Bulldogs cut the lead to 10 points late in the third quarter on a touchdown pass by Prescott. But A&M made it 37\u201320 two plays later on a 15-yard run by Williams. That scored was set up by a 75-yard reception by Evans.\n\nThe Bulldogs got within 10 points again after a touchdown throw by Tyler Russell with 2:19 remaining. But the onside kick was recovered by A&M. Bulldogs receiver Jameon Lewis threw a touchdown pass to Joe Morrow on a reverse early in the fourth quarter to get within 37\u201327. Trey Williams returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. But it was negated by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he flipped into the end zone.\n\nManziel was intercepted three times, twice by Jamerson Love. The turnovers helped keep Mississippi State close, but the Bulldogs couldn't keep up.\n\n===#1 Alabama===\n{{See also|Alabama Crimson Tide football|2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama\u2013Mississippi State football rivalry}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Alabama at Mississippi State\n|Visitor='''Crimson Tide'''\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=7|V4=3\n|Host=Bulldogs\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=0\n|Date= November 16\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:45 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:06\n|Attendance= 57,211\n|Weather= {{convert|65|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds N 10mph\n|Referee= Mark Curies\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brad Nessler]], [[Todd Blackledge]], and [[Holly Rowe]]\n|TVStation= [[ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=AUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Alabama Crimson Tide at Mississippi State Bulldogs (November 16, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1116.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=7:59 |Team=UA |Event=[[Cade Foster]] 33-yard kick good|Score= UA 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:20 |Team=UA |Event=Brian Vogler 18-yard touchdown pass from [[AJ McCarron]], Cade Foster kick good|Score= UA 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=10:11 |Team=MSU |Event=Charles Siddoway 0-yard fumble recovery, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= UA 10\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=5:46 |Team=UA |Event=[[Kevin Norwood]] 11-yard touchdown pass from AJ McCarron, Cade Foster kick good|Score= UA 17\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=12:15 |Team=UA |Event=Cade Foster 35-yard kick good|Score= UA 20\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

And the top-ranked Crimson Tide still found a way to win by nearly two touchdowns. [[T. J. Yeldon]] rushed for 160 yards and AJ McCarron threw two touchdown passes as Alabama overcame four turnovers to beat Mississippi State 20\u20137.\n\nIt was the lowest scoring game of the season for Alabama (10\u20130, 7\u20130 SEC), which led 10\u20137 midway through the third quarter before pulling away. Alabama has seemed invincible over the past two months, winning seven straight games by at least three touchdowns. But that aura wasn't anywhere to be found at Davis Wade Stadium, with Nick Saban's bunch looking curiously mortal after last week's emotional victory over LSU.\n\nMississippi State (4\u20136, 1\u20135) kept the game far closer than most anticipated, but couldn't take advantage of Alabama's mistakes. Tyler Russell started for the injured Dak Prescott and completed 15 of 24 passes for 144 yards and an interception before leaving with a shoulder injury when the Bulldogs were trying to rally in the fourth quarter. A.J. McCarron tossed two rare interceptions and Yeldon had a costly fumble that led to Mississippi State's only touchdown, but Alabama survived to set up a much-anticipated Iron Bowl with Auburn.\n\nMississippi State had two chances to get back into the game in the fourth quarter after McCarron's second interception and a fumble by [[Kenyan Drake]] gave the Bulldogs field position in Alabama territory. But without Russell, Mississippi State's offense went nowhere. Freshman Damian Williams didn't connect on any of his five pass attempts \u2013 though two of them were good passes that were dropped.\n\nMcCarron completed 18 of 32 passes. His first interception in the second quarter was his first in 139 pass attempts. It was the third 100-plus streak without an interception during his career. Alabama parlayed a methodical 14-play, 59-yard opening drive into Cade Foster's 33-yard field goal and a 3\u20130 lead. But the next four drives were brutal for the Crimson Tide's offense, which managed just two first downs during that span. Mississippi State tried to take advantage with a long drive midway through the second quarter, but it bogged down on the 7 and Evan Sobiesk missed a 24-yard field goal that could have tied the game. A few minutes later, the Tide finally broke through with Yeldon's 50-yard run down the sideline to Mississippi State's 28. McCarron hit Brian Vogler five plays later for an 18-yard touchdown pass with 20 seconds remaining in the second quarter to give Alabama a 10\u20130 halftime lead.\n\nIt looked like that would be all the breathing room Alabama needed, but the mistakes continued in the second half. Yeldon fumbled after a 10-yard run and Mississippi State's Beniquez Brown recovered at Alabama's 48. The Bulldogs then drove downfield and scored thanks to Russell's timely passes and a stroke of luck. Russell fumbled just short of a touchdown, but right tackle Charles Siddoway fell on the ball in the end zone to pull Mississippi State within 10\u20137. McCarron's 11-yard pass to Norwood pushed the Tide ahead 17\u20137 with 5:46 left in the third quarter. Alabama's defense held an opponent to seven points or less for the sixth time this season.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{See also|Arkansas Razorbacks football|2013 Arkansas Razorbacks football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Arkansas\n|Visitor='''Bulldogs'''\n|V1=0|V2=10|V3=0|V4=7|VOT=7\n|Host=Razorbacks\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=7|H4=0|HOT=0\n|Date= November 23\n|Location= [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]]<br>[[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock, AR]]\n|StartTime= 11:21 AM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:18\n|Attendance= 45,198\n|Weather= {{convert|44|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Cloudy, winds NNE 13mph\n|Referee= Matt Moore\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Dave Neal]] (Play-by-play), [[Andre Ware]] (Color), [[Cara Capuano]] (Sideline)\n|TVStation= [[SEC TV]]\n}} Source:<ref name=ARgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Arkansas Razorbacks (November 23, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1123.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=11:02 |Team=AR |Event=Javontee Herndon 8-yard touchdown run, Zach Hocker kick good|Score= AR 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:53 |Team=AR |Event=Zach Hocker 54-yard kick good|Score= AR 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:08 |Team=MSU |Event=Devon Bell 24-yard kick good|Score= AR 10\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:48 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 30-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Devon Bell kick good|Score= Tie 10\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=3:28 |Team=AR |Event=Julian Horton 22-yard touchdown run, Zach Hocker kick good|Score= AR 17\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=13:35 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 5-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Devon Bell kick good|Score= Tie 17\u201317}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=MSU |Event=Damian Williams 25-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 24\u201317|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

True Freshman and third-string quarterback Damian Williams scored on a 25-yard touchdown run on the first play of overtime, and the Mississippi State defense made it stand, as the Bulldogs defeated Arkansas 24\u201317 on Saturday at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock.\n\nMississippi State (5\u20136, 2\u20135 Southeastern Conference) got an interception by Taveze Calhoun on fourth down to seal the victory and keep its bowl hopes alive. Arkansas gained only one yard on its first three plays, and Calhoun stepped in front of the receiver and snared Brandon Allen's pass, returning it across midfield before being tackled. The Bulldogs lost to Arkansas in overtime contests in 1996, 2000 and 2010, all in Starkville, Miss., and had never defeated the Razorbacks in Arkansas. Mississippi State's best result in the Natural State was a 13\u201313 tie in 1993. Arkansas still leads the all-time series 15\u20138\u20131. The Bulldogs can become bowl eligible with a win over rival Ole Miss on Thanksgiving night in Starkville.\n\nMississippi State had a chance to win the game in regulation, but Devon Bell's 42-yard field goal drifted wide right with 24 seconds remaining. That came after Arkansas (3\u20138, 0\u20137) failed to cash in on its own chance to take the lead late in regulation. With the score tied 17\u201317, Allen passed to [[Jeremy Sprinkle]] for 44 yards to the Mississippi State 12. But [[Alex Collins (American football)|Alex Collins]] fumbled on the next play, and Nickoe Whitley recovered for the Bulldogs at the Arkansas 9.\n\nThe Razorbacks took the opening kick and went 56 yards for a touchdown. After Korliss Marshall's kick return gave the Razorbacks a short field, they quickly moved into Mississippi State territory. Javontee Herndon scored, also on an end around, and Arkansas led 7\u20130. Zach Hocker added a career-best 54-yard field goal in the second quarter to make it 10\u20130. Arkansas led 10\u20130 in the first half, but was unable to maintain the lead and lost its eighth consecutive game for the first time in school history. The Bulldogs countered in the final minutes of the second quarter. Bell's 24-yard field goal got them on the scoreboard with 5:08 left. Russell then found LaDarius Perkins on a play action down the middle of the field for a 30-yard touchdown to pull the Bulldogs even.\n\nAfter a first half that ended in a 10\u201310 tie, the Razorbacks took a 17\u201310 lead on a 22-yard run by Julian Horton in the third quarter on an end around. The Bulldogs answered immediately, covering 75 yards in 11 plays, as Tyler Russell connected with Jameon Lewis for a 5-yard touchdown on third down to knot the score. Russell completed 18 of 28 passes for 263 yards and two scores before leaving the game late in regulation with an apparent shoulder injury. Josh Robinson had 17 carries for 101 yards. Arkansas rushed for 225 yards as a team, spread out among nine ball carriers, but managed only 114 yards passing.\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{See also|2013 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Egg Bowl}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegePrimaryStyle|Mississippi State Bulldogs|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=Ole Miss Rebels (7\u20134) at Mississippi State Bulldogs (5\u20136)\n|date=November 28, 2013\n|time=6:30 p.m. [[Central Standard Time|CST]]\n|road=[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=3 |R4=0 |R5=0\n|home='''[[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi St]]'''\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=0 |H4=3 |H5=7\n|stadium=[[Davis Wade Stadium]], [[Starkville, Mississippi]]\n|attendance=55,113\n|weather=\n|referee=Marc Curles\n|TV=[[ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime|ESPN]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Rece Davis]], [[Jesse Palmer]], [[David Pollack]], and [[Maria Taylor (analyst)|Maria Taylor]]\n|reference=[https://hailstate.com/documents/2014/2/24/ms1128.htm Box Score]\n|scoring=\n'''Second quarter'''\n*MSU \u2013 Josh Robinson 1-yard run (Evan Sobiesk kick), 1:36.

Injured shoulder and all, the sophomore quarterback did just that, running for a 3-yard touchdown in overtime to lead the Bulldogs past rival Mississippi 17\u201310 on a chilly Thursday night at Davis Wade Stadium. Prescott didn't enter the game until the fourth quarter because of a nerve injury to his non-throwing arm that caused him to miss the previous two games. But the sophomore led the Bulldogs (6\u20136, 3\u20135 Southeastern Conference) to their tying drive in the fourth quarter and the game winner in overtime. Prescott completed 11 of 20 passes for 115 yards in a performance that will long be remembered in Egg Bowl lore. His game-winning touchdown came on a gutsy call by Mullen, who opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 at the 3 instead of kicking a short field goal. It was an emotional win for the Bulldogs and especially Prescott, whose mother died earlier this month after a yearlong battle with cancer.\n\nOle Miss had a chance to tie the game in overtime, but the drive ended when quarterback [[Bo Wallace]] fumbled and Mississippi State's Jamerson Love recovered the ball in the end zone. The Bulldogs are now bowl eligible for a fourth straight season, the longest streak in school history. Mississippi State has won four of the past five Egg Bowls and five in a row at Davis Wade Stadium.\n\nMississippi State Freshman Damian Williams, the third-string quarterback, made his first career start because of injuries to Prescott and Tyler Russell. He completed 8 of 18 passes for 82 yards and one interception. Both teams struggled to move the ball in the chilly conditions \u2013 especially through the air. The temperature hovered in the low 30s throughout the night, which is downright frigid by Magnolia State standards. Ole Miss (7\u20135, 3\u20135) didn't have an offensive touchdown, scoring only on a field goal and blocked punt in the end zone. The Rebels ended the regular season on a two-game losing streak. The Rebels had one good early drive but it ended with nothing after Andrew Ritter's 27-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright.\n\nWallace threw three interceptions before halftime, and the final one was costly. Mississippi State's Justin Cox grabbed it at the Ole Miss 30, and the Bulldogs' subsequent drive ended with Josh Robinson's 1-yard touchdown run for a 7\u20130 lead with 1:32 remaining in the second quarter. Ole Miss did nothing on its next possession and quickly punted back to Mississippi State, which looked as though it would ease into halftime with the lead. But a mistake on special teams hurt the Bulldogs when Collins Moore burst through the line and blocked Baker Swedenburg's punt after the snap was bobbled. It was recovered by little-used senior Terrell Grant in the end zone to tie the game at 7.\nOle Miss grabbed the lead for the first time early in the third quarter after Ritter's 22-yard field goal gave the Rebels a 10\u20137 advantage. The points were certainly welcome for the Ole Miss offense, but it was the team's fifth straight trip to the red zone without a touchdown, dating back to last weekend's loss to Missouri.\n\nThat lack of efficiency came back to haunt the Rebels. Williams played decently for the Bulldogs and avoided any major mistakes, but with the offense struggling early in the fourth quarter, Mullen turned to Prescott. Mullen said earlier in the week that Prescott wouldn't play in the Egg Bowl, but he looked plenty healthy as he led the Bulldogs down the field on his second drive, completing several impressive passes. The drive ended with Sobiesk's 36-yard field goal to tie it at 10. Mississippi State received the ball one final time but Sobiesk missed a 38-yard field goal wide right at the end of regulation that would have won the game.\n\n===Rice===\n{{See also|Rice Owls football|2013 Rice Owls football team|2013 Liberty Bowl}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Rice vs Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Rice\n|V1=7|V2=0|V3=0|V4=0\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1=7|H2=20|H3=14|H4=3\n|Date= December 31\n|Location= [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]<br>[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, TN]]\n|StartTime= 3:00 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:05\n|Attendance= 57,846\n|Weather= {{convert|47|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear, winds S 7mph\n|Referee= Ron Cherry\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Bob Wischusen]], [[Rod Gilmore]] and [[Quint Kessenich]]\n|TVStation= [[ESPN]]\n}} Source:<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice Owls vs Mississippi State Bulldogs (December 31, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1231.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=6:41 |Team=RICE |Event=Ross Charles 1-yard touchdown run, [[Chris Boswell]] kick good|Score= Rice 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=2:01 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 10-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=9:49 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:32 |Team=MSU |Event=Malcolm Johnson 13-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick blocked|Score= MSU 20\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:10 |Team=MSU |Event=Artimas Samuel 4-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 27\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:25 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 5-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 34\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=1:42 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 41\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=4:45 |Team=MSU |Event=Taylor Earhart 19-yard kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Prescott threw three touchdown passes and ran for two more scores Tuesday as Mississippi State trounced Rice 44\u20137 in the most one-sided AutoZone Liberty Bowl victory in the game's 55-year history in Memphis. The sophomore quarterback delivered arguably the finest performance of his career less than two months after his mother, Peggy, died of cancer.\n\nMississippi State (7\u20136) wrapped up its fourth straight winning season and prevented Rice (10\u20134) from winning bowl games in back-to-back years for the first time. All of Mississippi State's losses this season came against teams currently in the Top 25: No. 13 Oklahoma State, No. 2 Auburn, No. 14 LSU, No. 8 South Carolina, No. 20 Texas A&M and No. 3 Alabama. The Bulldogs became bowl eligible by closing the regular season with consecutive overtime victories over Arkansas and Ole Miss. This marks the first time since 1974 that Mississippi State has closed a season with three straight wins.\n\nNobody faced more adversity than Prescott, who set a Liberty Bowl record by accounting for five touchdowns. Prescott was 17 of 28 for 283 yards passing and also ran for 78 yards on 14 carries. Prescott's performance delighted a partisan crowd of 57,846 and capped a triumphant late-season performance amid personal tragedy for the sophomore quarterback. Prescott came off the bench in the fourth quarter to lead Mississippi State to a 17\u201310 overtime victory over Ole Miss last month that earned the Bulldogs a bowl bid. Although Prescott and senior Tyler Russell had shared quarterback duties throughout the regular season, Prescott had the job to himself in the Liberty Bowl while Russell recovered from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder. Prescott responded better than anyone could have reasonably imagined.\n\nPrescott wasn't Mississippi State's only star on a night when the Bulldogs outgained Rice 533\u2013145 and scored the game's final 44 points. Mississippi State's Jameon Lewis caught nine passes for 220 yards to break the Liberty Bowl receiving record held by Houston's Vincent Marshall, who had 201 yards in a 44\u201336 loss to South Carolina in 2006. Lewis also set the school single-game record.\n\nNot to forget, the Bulldogs also played dominant defense. Rice had won the Conference USA title \u2013 its first outright league championship of any kind since 1957 \u2013 by relying on a rushing attack that was ranked 16th among all Football Bowl Subdivision teams. Rice gained only 61 yards rushing \u2013 179 below its season average \u2013 on 32 carries against Mississippi State. Charles Ross, who entered the day having rushed for 1,252 yards and 14 touchdowns this season, was held to 28 yards on 10 carries.\n\nRice took an early lead on Ross' 1-yard touchdown run, but Mississippi State took control by reaching the end zone on six of its next seven possessions. Prescott threw first-half touchdown passes to LaDarius Perkins, Malcolm Johnson and Artimus Samuel before running for two scores in the third quarter.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{See also|2013 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS football rankings\n| finalpollweek = 16 | harrisfirstweek = 7 | bcsfirstweek = 8\n| AP_pre = NR\n| coaches_pre = RV\n| AP_1 = NR\n| coaches_1 = NR\n| AP_2 = NR\n| coaches_2 = NR\n| AP_3 = NR\n| coaches_3 = NR\n| AP_4 = NR\n| coaches_4 = NR\n| AP_5 = NR\n| coaches_5 = NR\n| AP_6 = NR\n| coaches_6 = NR\n| AP_7 = NR\n| coaches_7 = NR\n| harris_7 = NR\n| AP_8 = NR\n| coaches_8 = NR\n| harris_8 = NR\n| bcs_8 = NR\n| AP_9 = NR\n| coaches_9 = NR\n| harris_9 = NR\n| bcs_9 = NR\n| AP_10 = NR\n| coaches_10 = NR\n| harris_10 = NR\n| bcs_10 = NR\n| AP_11 = NR\n| coaches_11 = NR\n| harris_11 = NR\n| bcs_11 = NR\n| AP_12 = NR\n| coaches_12 = NR\n| harris_12 = NR\n| bcs_12 = NR\n| AP_13 = NR\n| coaches_13 = NR\n| harris_13 = NR\n| bcs_13 = NR\n| AP_14 = NR\n| coaches_14 = NR\n| harris_14 = NR\n| bcs_14 = NR\n| AP_15 = NR\n| coaches_15 = NR\n| harris_15 = NR\n| bcs_15 = NR\n| AP_16 = RV\n| coaches_16 = NR\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\nPassing Stats\n\nName\tCMP\tATT\tYDS\t%\tAVG\tTD\tINT\nDak Prescott\t156\t267\t1940\t58.4\t7.27\t10\t7\nTyler Russell\t71\t109\t875\t65.1\t8.03\t5\t3\nDamian Williams\t23\t47\t279\t48.9\t5.94\t0\t2\nJameon Lewis\t3\t3\t84\t100.0\t28.0\t3\t0\n\nRushing Stats\n\nName\tCAR\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tTD\nDak Prescott\t134\t829\t6.2\t75\t13\nLaDarius Perkins\t137\t542\t4.0\t35\t2\nJosh Robinson\t78\t459\t5.9\t51\t3\nAshton Shumpert\t46\t190\t4.1\t14\t3\nJameon Lewis\t13\t117\t9.0\t44\t3\nDamian Williams\t37\t112\t3.0\t25\t1\nNick Griffin\t24\t96\t4.0\t10\t1\nDerrick Milton\t13\t69\t5.3\t14\t2\n\nReceiving Stats\n\nName\tREC\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tTD\nJameon Lewis\t64\t923\t14.4\t65\t5\nMalcolm Johnson\t30\t391\t13.0\t60\t2\nRobert Johnson\t34\t389\t11.4\t61\t0\nDe\u2019Runnya Wilson\t26\t351\t13.5\t59\t3\nLaDarius Perkins\t27\t248\t9.2\t32\t3\nJoe Morrow\t18\t211\t11.7\t31\t1\nJosh Robinson\t12\t115\t12.8\t23\t0\nFred Ross\t9\t115\t12.8\t23\t0\nBrandon Holloway\t7\t77\t11.0\t34\t0\nFred Brown\t5\t74\t14.8\t19\t0\nDak Prescott\t2\t53\t26.5\t36\t2\n\nKicking Stats\n\nName\tXPM\tXPA\tFGM\tFGA\t%\tLNG\tPTS\nDevon Bell\t25\t26\t6\t14\t42.9\t40\t43\nEvan Sobiesk\t15\t16\t3\t6\t50.0\t38\t24\n\nPunting Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tI-20\nBlake Swedenberg\t25\t1063\t42.4\t53\t6\nDevon Bell\t24\t990\t41.2\t62\t14\n\nKick Returning Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tTD\tLNG\nJameon Lewis\t19\t446\t23.5\t0\t66\nRobert Johnson\t4\t41\t10.2\t0\t19\nBrandon Holloway\t3\t113\t37.7\t0\t95\nChris Harrison\t1\t7\t7.0\t0\t7\n\nPunt Return Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tTD\tLNG\nJameon Lewis\t22\t51\t2.3\t0\t16\nBrandon Holloway\t2\t36\t18.0\t0\t23\n\nDefensive Stats\n\nName\tSOLO\tAST\tTKL\tTFL\tSACKS\tINT\tFUM\nBrandon McKinney\t42\t29\t71\t7\t3.5\t0\t2\nDeontae Skinner\t33\t31\t64\t4.5\t1\t1\t0\nKendrick Market\t43\t19\t62\t1.5\t0\t0\t0\nNikoe Whitley\t38\t17\t55\t1\t0\t5\t1\nMatthew Wells\t28\t22\t50\t6\t1\t0\t2\nTaveze Calhoun\t33\t12\t45\t1.5\t0\t3\t1\nPreston Smith\t29\t15\t44\t6.5\t2.5\t0\t0\nBeniquez Brown\t16\t23\t39\t4.5\t0\t0\t2\nRichie Brown\t16\t22\t38\t3\t2\t1\t0\nZach Jackson\t16\t17\t33\t2.5\t0\t0\t0\nChris Jones\t17\t15\t32\t7\t3\t0\t0\nDenico Autry\t14\t17\t31\t6.5\t2\t0\t0\nJustin Cox\t23\t8\t31\t0.5\t0\t1\t0\nJamerson Love\t22\t5\t27\t1\t0\t3\t1\nKaleb Eulls\t9\t17\t26\t1.5\t0\t0\t0\nP.J.

The Cowboys' defense, however, kept Oklahoma State in the game long enough for their offense to wake up against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. J.W. Walsh threw for 135 yards and ran for another 125 and a touchdown to lead Oklahoma State to a 21\u20133 win over Mississippi State in the Texas Kickoff in Houston\u2019s Reliant Stadium.\n\nWalsh finished 18 of 27 after relieving starter Clint Chelf on the Cowboys' third series. Jeremy Smith rushed for 102 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries for Oklahoma State (1\u20130), which piled up 432 yards on offense after struggling for most of the first half.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s [[Tyler Russell]] finished 10 of 16 for 133 yards before being helped off the field and taken to the locker room in the third quarter after being brought down on a scramble. [[Dak Prescott]] replaced Russell, throwing for 89 yards on seven of 17 passing. [[LaDarius Perkins]] rushed for 50 yards on 16 carries and caught three passes for 52 yards for the Bulldogs (0\u20131), which had only 333 yards of offense and had trouble keeping drives going, finishing two of 16 on third down conversions. Oklahoma State's defense also had three sacks and intercepted two Mississippi State passes.\n\nMississippi State marched down the field in 57 yards on 13 plays taking over six minutes off the clock, but the Bulldogs were only able to get Devon Bell's 40-yard field goal to take a 3\u20130 lead. Russell was 5 of 7 on the drive for 58 yards. Oklahoma State's offense gained only 67 yards with less than four minutes remaining in the first half before Walsh got going. Walsh worked the quarterback keeper three times for gains of 46 yards down the left sideline, 12 yards down the left sideline to the MSU 3 and capping it off with a 3-yard touchdown run to give the Cowboys a 7\u20133 lead with 2:16 left in the half. The Bulldogs looked to respond before the half as Jameon Lewis weaved the kickoff return 66 yards to the OSU 34, but a holding penalty and a sack by Tyler Johnson stopped the drive.\n\nOSU continued the offensive momentum in the second half, driving 75 yards in 11 plays to take a 14\u20133 lead on a Smith 1-yard run with 10:41 left in the third. Smith tacked on a 20-yard touchdown run to begin the fourth quarter to up the lead to 21\u20133.\n\n===Alcorn State===\n{{See also|Alcorn State Braves football|2013 Alcorn State Braves football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Alcorn State at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Braves\n|V1= 0|V2= 0|V3= 0|V4= 7\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1= 14|H2= 23|H3= 7|H4= 7\n|Date= September 7\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 2:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:00\n|Attendance=55,085\n|Weather= {{convert|92|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Mostly sunny, winds SE 2mph\n|Referee= Dan Romeo\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Mike Morgan (broadcaster)|Mike Morgan]], [[Cole Cubelic]] and Paul Carcaterra\n|TVStation= [[Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast|CSS]]\n}} Source:<ref name=AlcornStategamestats>{{cite web|title=Alcorn State Braves at Mississippi State Bulldogs (September 7, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms0907.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=9:22 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=6:16 |Team=MSU |Event=Derrick Milton 3-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=11:34 |Team=MSU |Event=Derrick Milton 14-yard touchdown pass from Dak Presscott, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 21\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 28\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:15 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 31-yard touchdown pass from Dak Presscott, Devon Bell kick failed|Score= MSU 34\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:58 |Team=MSU |Event=Devon Bell 26-yard kick good|Score= MSU 37\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=13:57 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=11:42 |Team=ASU |Event=Tollette George 25-yard touchdown pass from John Gibbs, Jr., Haiden McCraney kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:00 |Team=MSU |Event=Nick Griffin 10-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 51\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Mississippi State (1\u20131) didn't use several regular starters, including quarterback Tyler Russell, who suffered a concussion in the Bulldogs' season-opening loss to Oklahoma State. It didn't matter. The Bulldogs led 21\u20130 by early in the second quarter and 37\u20130 by halftime. It was the most points in the first half for the program since 1996. Mississippi State's Ashton Shumpert rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns. Nick Griffin added 54 yards on the ground and a touchdown.\n\nAlcorn State (1\u20131), which plays in the Football Championship Subdivision, managed just two first downs in the first three quarters. The Braves scored their only touchdown early in the fourth quarter on a 25-yard pass from John Gibbs Jr. to Tollete George.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 230-pound Prescott showed his poise early in the first quarter by converting two straight passes on 4th and 9 for a first down. The first was an 18-yard strike to Joe Morrow, but it was disallowed after officials ruled Alcorn State had called timeout. A sold out Davis Wade Stadium groaned, but Prescott came right back and hit Malcolm Johnson for a 23-yard gain. Two plays later, Prescott burst through the line for an 11-yard touchdown run and a 7\u20130 lead. The rout was just beginning. Mississippi State outgained Alcorn State 308\u201330 in total yards on the way to the huge halftime lead. Prescott completed 12 of 19 passes while also rushing for 20 yards and a touchdown. He didn't play in the second half.\n\nThe second half started just as lopsided. Brandon Holloway ran the kickoff back 95 yards to Alcorn's 1-yard line, and Mississippi State scored two plays later for a 44\u20130 lead with 13:57 left in the third quarter. Alcorn State's George finished with four catches for 80 yards and the Braves' only touchdown. Gibbs was 11 of 25 passing for 135 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\n===Auburn===\n{{See also|Auburn Tigers football|2013 Auburn Tigers football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Auburn\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1= 6 |V2= 7 |V3= 7 |V4= 0\n|Host='''Tigers'''\n|H1= 11 |H2= 3 |H3= 3 |H4= 7\n|Date= September 14\n|Location= [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]]<br>[[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn, AL]]\n|StartTime= 6:00 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:14\n|Attendance= 85,817\n|Weather= {{convert|78|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Sunny, winds NE 4mph\n|Referee= Matt Moore\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Mark Jones (sportscaster)|Mark Jones]], [[Brock Huard]] and Maria Taylor\n|TVStation= [[ESPN2 College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN2]]\n}} Source:<ref name=Auburngamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Auburn Tigers (September 14, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms0914.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=10:53 |Team=AU |Event=[[Cody Parkey]] 40-yard kick good|Score= AU 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:54 |Team=AU |Event=[[Quan Bray]] 76-yard touchdown pass from [[Nick Marshall]], Brandon Fulse pass from Ryan White|Score= AU 11\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:09 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 14-yard touchdown run, Nick Griffin rush failed|Score= AU 11\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=13:36 |Team=AU |Event=Cody Parkey 40-yard kick good|Score= AU 14\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:02 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 5-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= AU 14\u201313}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=12:38 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 2-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 20\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=9:53 |Team=AU |Event=Cody Parkey 47-yard kick good|Score= MSU 20\u201317}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=0:10 |Team=AU |Event=[[C.

Uzomah for an 11-yard touchdown with 10 seconds left to lift Auburn to a 24\u201320 victory over Mississippi State on Saturday night, ending the Tigers' 10-game Southeastern Conference losing streak. Marshall led the Tigers (3\u20130, 1\u20130 SEC) down the field with big running and passing plays in easily his best game. The junior-college transfer completed his first five passes for 55 yards in leading Auburn 88 yards over the final 1:56. He then ran 11 yards on 3rd-and-10 before lofting the decisive throw to the right corner of the end zone. The play was reviewed and instant replay officials ruled that the 6-foot-4 tight end, Uzomah, was pushed out of bounds, enabling him to come back.\n\nSubbing for an injured Tyler Russell for a second straight game, quarterback Dak Prescottran for 133 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 213 for Mississippi State (1\u20132, 0\u20131). Russell sustained a concussion in the opener against Oklahoma State.\n\nWith the game on the line, Marshall suddenly looked like anything but a guy who's had six weeks to learn an offense. He hit freshman Marcus Davis on three straight passes to cover 29 yards, then had a 17-yarder to Jaylon Denson. He also salvaged short gains with a couple of runs before heading out of bounds. [[Tre Mason]]'s 3-yard run pushed it to the 11 before Auburn called timeout with 15 seconds left.\nMarshall was 23-of-34 passing for 339 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted twice. He passed for just 246 yards and two TDs in his first two games as starter combined. Marshall showed a knack for turning potential miscues into big plays. He dropped the shotgun snap, collected it on the bounce and hit a wide-open Quan Bray downfield for a 76-yard touchdown on the opening drive. Ryan White then hit Brandon Fulse for the two-point conversion.\nIn the third quarter, Marshall caught his own batted pass and raced for a 37-yard gain. The Bulldogs forced the Tigers to settle for Cody Parkey's 47-yard field goal after Jamerson Love tackled Corey Grant for a loss. Parkey also had a 40-yarder and 19-yarder.\n\nThe Bulldogs were able to keep in check Auburn tailbacks Corey Grant, Tre Mason andCameron Artis-Payne, who had been the strength of the offense. Prescott completed 15 of 28 passes and carried 22 times. LaDarius Perkins gained 36 yards after he was one of seven starters held out of a route of FCS team Alcorn State.\n\nMississippi State coach Dan Mullen gambled on fourth-and-2 from his own 29 late, and Prescott delivered with a 3-yard gain. That enabled the Bulldogs to burn off another two minutes before punting, though they couldn't get another first down. It proved just enough time for the Tigers.\n\nMississippi State twice forced turnovers in Auburn territory in the second half, but failed to produce points both times.\n\n===Troy===\n{{See also|Troy Trojans football|2013 Troy Trojans football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Troy at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Trojans\n|V1= 7 |V2= 0 |V3= 0 |V4= 0\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1= 10 |H2= 35 |H3= 7 |H4= 10\n|Date= September 21\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:06\n|Attendance= 55,096\n|Weather= {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds N 5mph\n|Referee= Tony Backert\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Bob Rathbun]], [[Tim Couch]], and Elizabeth Moreau\n|TVStation= [[Fox Sports Networks|SECRN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=Troygamestats>{{cite web|title=Troy Trojans at Mississippi State Bulldogs (September 21, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms0921.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=13:00 |Team=MSU |Event=Jamerson Love 70-yard interception return, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=3:08 |Team=MSU |Event=Devon Bell 25-yard kick good|Score= MSU 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=0:10 |Team=TU |Event=Eric Thomas 5-yard touchdown pass from Corey Robinson, Jedd Solomon kick good|Score= MSU 10\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=13:44 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 36-yard touchdown pass from Jameon Lewis, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 17\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=11:55 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 22-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 24\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=8:08 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 11-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 31\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=3:03 |Team=MSU |Event=Josh Robinson 19-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 38\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:00 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 50-yard touchdown pass from Dak Presscott, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 45\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=10:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 8-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 52\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=11:29 |Team=MSU |Event=Evan Sobiesk 24-yard kick good|Score= MSU 55\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=4:47 |Team=MSU |Event=Derrick Milton 10-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 62\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Prescott's diverse and efficient performance was matched by Jameon Lewis, who caught a 50-yard touchdown pass, rushed for an 8-yard touchdown and threw the 36-yard touchdown that Prescott caught on a trick play. Prescott was starting just his third career game. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound sophomore completed 13 of 21 passes.\n\nMississippi State (2\u20132) led 10\u20137 after the first quarter, but erupted for 35 points in the second quarter to take a 45\u20137 halftime lead. Troy (2\u20132) never recovered from the brutal second quarter. Corey Robinson, who is the NCAA's active leader in career passing yards, completed 15 of 25 passes for just 105 yards, one touchdown and one interception. It was the most points Mississippi State has scored in a game since 1994. The Bulldogs finished with 551 total yards.\n\nBesides Prescott and Lewis, Mississippi State didn't have many players with big individual numbers. That's because just about any Bulldog who touched the ball produced. Ten players caught a pass and nine had at least one rushing attempt.\n\nThe Troy-Mississippi State series has traditionally been close, with the Trojans even earning one of the biggest wins in school history against the Bulldogs in 2001.

It was the ninth and final time the two hooked up for a completion, and it proved to be the knockout blow. Mettenberger threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns, Beckham had 179 yards receiving and two touchdowns and No. 10 LSU blew past Mississippi State for a 59\u201326 victory.\n\nIt was a tight game for three quarters, but Mettenberger's touchdown to Beckham gave LSU a 38\u201326 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter and Mississippi State couldn't respond. LSU closed the game on a 31\u20130 run, including four touchdowns in the fourth quarter.\nMettenberger completed 25 of 29 passes in another impressive performance during the senior's breakout season. Beckham was his favorite target \u2013 but [[Jarvis Landry]] also caught eight passes for 96 yards. It was a nearly flawless performance, and helped erase some of the sting of last week's 44\u201341 loss to Georgia. LSU's Jeremy Hill added 157 yards rushing and two touchdowns while Kenny Hilliard added 39 yards rushing and three touchdowns. The Tigers (5\u20131, 2\u20131 Southeastern Conference) have won 14 straight over Mississippi State (2\u20133, 0\u20132) dating back to 1999. LSU has a 21\u20131 record under Miles following a loss.\n\nMississippi State's Dak Prescott threw for 106 yards and rushed for 103 more. Jameon Lewis caught seven passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. The Bulldogs' offense was good, especially early, but LSU's was even better. The Tigers' receiver duo of Landry and Beckham was unstoppable, even when Mississippi State appeared to have good coverage, and Mettenberger found them early and often. The Tigers finished with 563 total yards.\n\nLSU needed all those yards, because the defense was gashed for a second straight week. The Tigers gave up nearly 500 yards last week in a loss to Georgia and Mississippi State had some early success with a two-quarterback system. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Prescott has been terrific in Russell's place, providing much more of a running threat. On the team's first offensive drive, he rewarded Mullen's confidence with a 28-yard touchdown run to pull the Bulldogs to 7\u20136. Russell entered the game early in the second quarter and also had immediate success, throwing a 20-yard touchdown to Lewis to pull Mississippi State to 21\u201316 in the second quarter. The Bulldogs took a 23\u201321 lead on Russell's 59-yard touchdown pass to De'Runnya Wilson, but LSU responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Mettenberger to Beckham to take a 28\u201323 lead into halftime. Russell's second touchdown pass was the 39th of his career, which set a Mississippi State record. He finished 7 of 11 for 146 yards passing.\n\nThe teams combined for 608 total yards in the first half \u2013 334 for LSU and 274 for Mississippi State. LSU's defense tightened in the second half, giving up just three points.\n\n===Bowling Green===\n{{See also|Bowling Green Falcons football|2013 Bowling Green Falcons football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Bowling Green at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Falcons\n|V1=3|V2=10|V3=7|V4=0\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1=14|H2=7|H3=0|H4=0\n|Date= October 12\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:10\n|Attendance= 55,148\n|Weather= {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds light\n|Referee= Tom Ritter\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Bob Rathbun]], [[Tim Couch]] and [[Elizabeth Moreau]]\n|TVStation= [[Fox Sports Networks|SECRN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=BGSUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Bowling Green Falcons at Mississippi State Bulldogs (October 12, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1012.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=9:58 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 1-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:36 |Team=BGSU |Event=Tyler Tate 35-yard kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:24 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 75-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:15 |Team=BGSU |Event=Andre Givins 7-yard touchdown run, Tyler Tate kick good|Score= MSU 14\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:04 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Presscott 10-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:00 |Team=BGSU |Event=Tyler Tate 45-yard kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201313}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=3:57 |Team=BGSU |Event=Matt Johnson 2-yard touchdown run, Tyler Tate kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201320|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

After a failed fourth-and-1 by MSU, Bowling Green (5\u20132) had the ball and 4:21 on the clock at the end of the game, but couldn't get inside field goal range. Mississippi State (3\u20133) had 422 yards of offense, 245 on the ground as the Bulldogs won their 11th straight nonconference home game.\n\nThe game was a back-and-forth affair. Mississippi State opened the game on a 9-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a LaDarius Perkins touchdown. Bowling Green's BooBoo Gates intercepted Prescott on MSU's next offensive series, and the Falcons eventually settled for a 35-yard field goal by Tyler Tate. Prescott responded on the next drive by rushing for a 75-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Bowling Green answered with a 96-yard drive capped off by a 7-yardAndre Givens touchdown run. Mississippi State countered with a 75-yard drive and a 10-yard Prescott touchdown run with 1:04 left in the second quarter. But quarterback Matt Johnson worked Bowling Green into field goal range, and Tate nailed a 45-yarder to end the first half.\n\nTate missed a 45-yard field goal on the opening drive of the third quarter, but Bowling Green responded with a 7-play touchdown drive on its next possession, to pull within one point; the eventual final margin. With 4:21 left in the game, Mississippi State went for a fourth-and-1 on the Bowling Green six yard line. Prescott's rush was inches short, and the Bulldogs turned it over on downs. Johnson completed four passes and Green rushed once to get the Falcons to midfield. But then the drive stalled, and Johnson failed to complete a fourth-and-11 to Ryan Burbrink, and Mississippi State ran out the clock.\n\nFor MSU, Perkins rushed for 83 yards and one touchdown. Perkins, Joe Morrow and Jameon Lewis each caught four passes. Prescott was also 7-of-11 passing for 75 yards and one interception. Mullen again used both Prescott, a sophomore, and veteran quarterback Tyler Russell throughout the game. Russell finished 12-of-14 for 102 yards.\n\nJohnson was 19-of-33 for 194 yards for Bowling Green. Travis Green rushed for 99 yards and Ryan Burbrink caught four passes for a game-high 66 yards. Bowling Green's Gates was ejected in the second quarter for targeting.\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{See also|Kentucky Wildcats football|2013 Kentucky Wildcats football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Kentucky at Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Kentucky\n|V1=7|V2=3|V3=9|V4=3\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1=14|H2=7|H3=7|H4=0\n|Date= October 24\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:24\n|Attendance= 55,102\n|Weather= {{convert|65|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds light\n|Referee= Hubert Owens\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Rece Davis]], [[Jesse Palmer]], and [[David Pollack]]\n|TVStation= [[ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime|ESPN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=UKgamestats>{{cite web|title=Kentucky Wildcats at Mississippi State Bulldogs (October 24, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1024.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=11:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Malcolm Johnson 60-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=8:38 |Team=UK |Event=Ryan Timmons 51-yard touchdown pass from Maxwell Smith, Joe Mansour kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=6:34 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 19-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:14 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 17-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 21\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:31 |Team=UK |Event=Joe Mansour 45-yard kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=5:26 |Team=UK |Event=Team Safety|Score= MSU 21\u201312}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=5:26 |Team=UK |Event=Jojo Kemp 14-yard touchdown run, Joe Mansour kick good|Score= MSU 21\u201319}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:36 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 17-yard touchdown pass from Jameon Lewis, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 28\u201319}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=8:15 |Team=UK |Event=Joe Mansour 45-yard kick good|Score= MSU 28\u201322|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The Bulldogs had picked up their first Southeastern Conference victory of the season. But it wasn't easy at all. Mississippi State beat Kentucky 28\u201322 on Thursday night at Davis Wade Stadium. The Bulldogs built a 21\u20137 lead in the first half, but couldn't secure the game until Kentucky's last drive fell short at Mississippi State's 29 with 21 seconds left.\n\nDak Prescott threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns and also caught a 17-yard touchdown pass in another impressive all-around performance. He completed a career-high 23 of 34 passes and also rushed for 33 yards. Jameon Lewis had a 19-yard touchdown run, caught a 17-yard scoring pass and also threw the 17-yard touchdown to Prescott on a trick play. Mississippi State (4\u20133, 1\u20132 SEC) beat Kentucky (1\u20136, 0\u20134) for a fifth straight season. It's the second time this season Lewis has had rushing, receiving and passing touchdowns in a game. The 5-foot-9, 195-pound senior was a quarterback in high school and Mullen relishes his diverse skill set.\n\nKentucky's Joe Mansour made a 44-yard field goal with 8:15 remaining to pull the Wildcats to 28\u201322.\nMississippi State chewed up 6 minutes of clock the ensuing next drive, but Kentucky had one final chance. The Wildcats methodically moved downfield until Maxwell Smith's fourth-down pass missed its target and Mississippi State escaped.\n\nKentucky pulled to 21\u201319 in the third quarter on Jojo Kemp's 14-yard touchdown run. Then in what proved to be a key moment, the Wildcats recovered an onside kick, only to have it disallowed because of an offsides penalty. Mississippi State took advantage. A 74-yard drive ended on the halfback pass from Lewis to Prescott, who handed the ball off before leaking into the open field for the catch, touchdown and 28\u201319 lead. Prescott, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound sophomore, completed 11 of 18 passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, helping Mississippi State to a 21\u201310 halftime lead.\n\nPrescott's first touchdown pass \u2013 a 60-yard fling to a wide open Malcolm Johnson \u2013 came after he danced out of the pocket while avoiding a sack. Kentucky's defense shifted forward because of Prescott's ability to run, and it gave Johnson time to slip behind the secondary undetected. The Bulldogs had 296 total yards in the first half. Mississippi State started the game with the intention of using two quarterbacks, but Tyler Russell suffered a sprained ankle on his first series and never returned.\n\nKentucky's offense had a few good early moments \u2013 especially on a 51-yard screen pass from Smith to Timmons that tied the game at 7 \u2013 but the Wildcats became predictable because of their inability to throw downfield. Smith has dealt with pain in his throwing shoulder all season and wasn't close on most of his attempts to complete long passes. Kentucky's Smith completed 18 of 33 passes for 160 yards and one touchdown. Backup Jalen Whitlow led one touchdown drive, but was hampered because of a previous ankle injury. Raymond Sanders had 86 yards rushing.\n\nMississippi State safety Nickoe Whitley was ejected in the second quarter after earning two personal foul penalties over a span of four plays. The extra 30 yards greatly aided Kentucky on a drive that ended on a 45-yard field goal by Mansour.\n\n===#14 South Carolina===\n{{See also|South Carolina Gamecocks football|2013 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at South Carolina\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1=7|V2=3|V3=0|V4=6\n|Host='''Gamecocks'''\n|H1=14|H2=3|H3=17|H4=0\n|Date= November 2\n|Location= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]]<br>[[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia, SC]]\n|StartTime= 11:21 AM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:24\n|Attendance= 82,111\n|Weather= {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Sunny, winds W 5mph\n|Referee= Tom Ritter\n|TVAnnouncers= Dave Neal, [[Andre Ware]], and [[Cara Capuano]]\n|TVStation= [[SEC TV|SECTV]]\n}} Source:<ref name=USCgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at South Carolina Gamecocks (November 2, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1102.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=8:46 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 1-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=6:23 |Team=USC |Event=Shaq Roland 14-yard touchdown pass from [[Connor Shaw]], [[Elliott Fry]] kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=1:20 |Team=USC |Event=Shaq Roland 43-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 14\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=11:45 |Team=USC |Event=Elliott Fry 44-yard kick good|Score= USC 17\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:15 |Team=MSU |Event=Evan Sobiesk 38-yard kick good|Score= USC 17\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=12:54 |Team=USC |Event=[[Damiere Byrd]] 6-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 24\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:52 |Team=USC |Event=Jerell Adams 4-yard touchdown pass from Connor Shaw, Elliott Fry kick good|Score= USC 31\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=2:07 |Team=USC |Event=Elliott Fry 37-yard kick good|Score= USC 34\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:38 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Dak Prescott pass failed|Score= USC 34\u201316|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

It had been a long time coming for a group that had been one of the Southeastern Conference's best defenses the past few years. The Gamecocks had collected only 11 turnovers its first eight games, but got five of them \u2013 four off Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott \u2013 to pull away in the second half. The Gamecocks (7\u20132, 5\u20132 SEC) got 20 points off the turnovers, including 10 in the third quarter as they went from a touchdown up to a 34\u201310 lead.\n\nShaw played quarterback just the way he always has \u2013 with an emphasis on results. He missed practice Monday and Tuesday with a virus and was not as sharp as usual. Still, the senior tied his career best with the four touchdown passes. He had scoring throws of 14 and 43 yards to Shaq Roland, 6 yards to Damiere Byrd and 4 yards to Jerell Adams to move to 23\u20135 as South Carolina's starting quarterback. Shaw can tie Todd Ellis' school record for victories when South Carolina plays Florida here in two weeks. Davis had 128 yards and became the Gamecocks' first 1,000-yard rusher since [[Marcus Lattimore]] ran for 1,197 yards his freshman season three years ago. South Carolina won its seventh in row over the Bulldogs (4\u20134, 1\u20133).\n\nPrescott threw three interceptions \u2013 he had just three in seven games coming in \u2013 and had a fumble. He did have touchdown runs of 1 and 11 yards, upping his SEC-leading touchdown total to 12.\n\nThe Gamecocks got themselves back in the SEC Eastern Division hunt with last week's 27\u201324, double-overtime victory at then No. 5 Missouri. South Carolina's home streak is the second current longest in the country behind Michigan's 19 in a row.\n\n===#11 Texas A&M===\n{{See also|Texas A&M Aggies football|2013 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Texas A&M\n|Visitor=Bulldogs\n|V1=7|V2=7|V3=6|V4=21\n|Host='''Aggies'''\n|H1=16|H2=7|H3=14|H4=14\n|Date= November 9\n|Location= [[Kyle Field]]<br>[[College Station, Texas|College Station, TX]]\n|StartTime= 2:30 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:53\n|Attendance= 88,504\n|Weather= {{convert|62|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Partly Cloudy, winds E 6mph\n|Referee= Ken Williamson\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Tim Brando]], [[Aaron Taylor (American football, born 1972)|Aaron Taylor]], and Kristina Akra\n|TVStation= [[SEC on CBS|CBS]]\n}} Source:<ref name=TAMUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Texas A&M Aggies (November 9, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1109.htm|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=5:45 |Team=TAMU |Event=Malcome Kennedy 12-yard touchdown pass from [[Johnny Manziel]], [[Josh Lambo]] kick good|Score= TAMU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:28 |Team=MSU |Event=Josh Robinson 51-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=1:28 |Team=TAMU |Event=Team Safety|Score= TAMU 9\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=0:11 |Team=TAMU |Event=[[Travis Labhart]] 33-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo  kick good|Score= TAMU 16\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:54 |Team=MSU |Event=De'Runnya Wilson 3-yard touchdown pass Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= TAMU 16\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:16 |Team=TAMU |Event=Travis Labhart 11-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo  kick good|Score= TAMU 23\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:34 |Team=TAMU |Event=Malcome Kennedy 21-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 30\u201314}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:44 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 12-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Dak Prescott pass intercepted|Score= TAMU 30\u201320}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:12 |Team=TAMU |Event=Trey 15-yard touchdown run, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 37\u201320}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=14:53 |Team=MSU |Event=Joe Morrow 33-yard touchdown pass from Jameon Lewis, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= TAMU 37\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=13:54 |Team=TAMU |Event=Nehemiah Hicks 2-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 44\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=10:54 |Team=TAMU |Event=[[Ben Malena]] 2-yard touchdown run, Josh Lambo kick good|Score= TAMU 51\u201327}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=6:45 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 1-yard touchdown run, Dak Prescott rush|Score= TAMU 51\u201335}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=2:19 |Team=MSU |Event=De'Runnya Wilson 9-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Tyler Russell rush failed|Score= TAMU 51\u201341|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The crowd chanted \"one more year\" late in the game for Manziel, who is eligible for the draft after this season. Whether he comes back remains to be seen, but he went into the stands to celebrate with the student section when the game was over. Manziel denied that he even has entertained the thought that he might not play here again. Among the crowd of 88,504, third largest ever at A&M, on hand to see Manziel play at Kyle Field for the possibly final time was former President George H.W. Bush and former Texas A&M and current St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha. Texas governor Rick Perry was the co-pilot in the pre-game flyover and also attended the game. Manziel set a school career record for total yards with 9,040 and a single-season record with 31 touchdown passes. He became just the second A&M quarterback to run for 2,000 yards in a career and has 3,313 yards passing this year to become the first Aggie with two 3,000-yard passing seasons.\n\nMississippi State cut the lead to 10 points early in the fourth quarter, but Manziel threw his fifth touchdown pass to make it 44\u201327 for A&M (8\u20132, 4\u20132 Southeastern Conference). The defense grabbed an interception and Ben Malena's 2-yard touchdown run extended the lead to 51\u201327. Dak Prescott threw for 149 yards and two scores and ran for 154 yards for Mississippi State (4\u20135, 1\u20134). Kennedy and Travis Labhart had two touchdown receptions each. Mike Evans had 116 yards receiving to break the school single-season record with 1,263.\n\nRussell started the game in place of Prescott, who missed practice this week after his mother died of cancer on Sunday. Prescott entered the game on Mississippi State's third drive and got the majority of the snaps after that. Manziel evaded the rush and connected with Kennedy for a 21-yard touchdown to extend Texas A&M's lead to 30\u201314 in the third quarter. The Bulldogs cut the lead to 10 points late in the third quarter on a touchdown pass by Prescott. But A&M made it 37\u201320 two plays later on a 15-yard run by Williams. That scored was set up by a 75-yard reception by Evans.\n\nThe Bulldogs got within 10 points again after a touchdown throw by Tyler Russell with 2:19 remaining. But the onside kick was recovered by A&M. Bulldogs receiver Jameon Lewis threw a touchdown pass to Joe Morrow on a reverse early in the fourth quarter to get within 37\u201327. Trey Williams returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. But it was negated by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he flipped into the end zone.\n\nManziel was intercepted three times, twice by Jamerson Love. The turnovers helped keep Mississippi State close, but the Bulldogs couldn't keep up.\n\n===#1 Alabama===\n{{See also|Alabama Crimson Tide football|2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama\u2013Mississippi State football rivalry}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Alabama at Mississippi State\n|Visitor='''Crimson Tide'''\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=7|V4=3\n|Host=Bulldogs\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=0\n|Date= November 16\n|Location= [[Davis Wade Stadium]]<br>[[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville, MS]]\n|StartTime= 6:45 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:06\n|Attendance= 57,211\n|Weather= {{convert|65|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear skies, winds N 10mph\n|Referee= Mark Curies\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brad Nessler]], [[Todd Blackledge]], and [[Holly Rowe]]\n|TVStation= [[ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN]]\n}} Source:<ref name=AUgamestats>{{cite web|title=Alabama Crimson Tide at Mississippi State Bulldogs (November 16, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1116.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=7:59 |Team=UA |Event=[[Cade Foster]] 33-yard kick good|Score= UA 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:20 |Team=UA |Event=Brian Vogler 18-yard touchdown pass from [[AJ McCarron]], Cade Foster kick good|Score= UA 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=10:11 |Team=MSU |Event=Charles Siddoway 0-yard fumble recovery, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= UA 10\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=5:46 |Team=UA |Event=[[Kevin Norwood]] 11-yard touchdown pass from AJ McCarron, Cade Foster kick good|Score= UA 17\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=12:15 |Team=UA |Event=Cade Foster 35-yard kick good|Score= UA 20\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

And the top-ranked Crimson Tide still found a way to win by nearly two touchdowns. [[T. J. Yeldon]] rushed for 160 yards and AJ McCarron threw two touchdown passes as Alabama overcame four turnovers to beat Mississippi State 20\u20137.\n\nIt was the lowest scoring game of the season for Alabama (10\u20130, 7\u20130 SEC), which led 10\u20137 midway through the third quarter before pulling away. Alabama has seemed invincible over the past two months, winning seven straight games by at least three touchdowns. But that aura wasn't anywhere to be found at Davis Wade Stadium, with Nick Saban's bunch looking curiously mortal after last week's emotional victory over LSU.\n\nMississippi State (4\u20136, 1\u20135) kept the game far closer than most anticipated, but couldn't take advantage of Alabama's mistakes. Tyler Russell started for the injured Dak Prescott and completed 15 of 24 passes for 144 yards and an interception before leaving with a shoulder injury when the Bulldogs were trying to rally in the fourth quarter. A.J. McCarron tossed two rare interceptions and Yeldon had a costly fumble that led to Mississippi State's only touchdown, but Alabama survived to set up a much-anticipated Iron Bowl with Auburn.\n\nMississippi State had two chances to get back into the game in the fourth quarter after McCarron's second interception and a fumble by [[Kenyan Drake]] gave the Bulldogs field position in Alabama territory. But without Russell, Mississippi State's offense went nowhere. Freshman Damian Williams didn't connect on any of his five pass attempts \u2013 though two of them were good passes that were dropped.\n\nMcCarron completed 18 of 32 passes. His first interception in the second quarter was his first in 139 pass attempts. It was the third 100-plus streak without an interception during his career. Alabama parlayed a methodical 14-play, 59-yard opening drive into Cade Foster's 33-yard field goal and a 3\u20130 lead. But the next four drives were brutal for the Crimson Tide's offense, which managed just two first downs during that span. Mississippi State tried to take advantage with a long drive midway through the second quarter, but it bogged down on the 7 and Evan Sobiesk missed a 24-yard field goal that could have tied the game. A few minutes later, the Tide finally broke through with Yeldon's 50-yard run down the sideline to Mississippi State's 28. McCarron hit Brian Vogler five plays later for an 18-yard touchdown pass with 20 seconds remaining in the second quarter to give Alabama a 10\u20130 halftime lead.\n\nIt looked like that would be all the breathing room Alabama needed, but the mistakes continued in the second half. Yeldon fumbled after a 10-yard run and Mississippi State's Beniquez Brown recovered at Alabama's 48. The Bulldogs then drove downfield and scored thanks to Russell's timely passes and a stroke of luck. Russell fumbled just short of a touchdown, but right tackle Charles Siddoway fell on the ball in the end zone to pull Mississippi State within 10\u20137. McCarron's 11-yard pass to Norwood pushed the Tide ahead 17\u20137 with 5:46 left in the third quarter. Alabama's defense held an opponent to seven points or less for the sixth time this season.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{See also|Arkansas Razorbacks football|2013 Arkansas Razorbacks football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Mississippi State at Arkansas\n|Visitor='''Bulldogs'''\n|V1=0|V2=10|V3=0|V4=7|VOT=7\n|Host=Razorbacks\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=7|H4=0|HOT=0\n|Date= November 23\n|Location= [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]]<br>[[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock, AR]]\n|StartTime= 11:21 AM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:18\n|Attendance= 45,198\n|Weather= {{convert|44|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Cloudy, winds NNE 13mph\n|Referee= Matt Moore\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Dave Neal]] (Play-by-play), [[Andre Ware]] (Color), [[Cara Capuano]] (Sideline)\n|TVStation= [[SEC TV]]\n}} Source:<ref name=ARgamestats>{{cite web|title=Mississippi State Bulldogs at Arkansas Razorbacks (November 23, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1123.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=11:02 |Team=AR |Event=Javontee Herndon 8-yard touchdown run, Zach Hocker kick good|Score= AR 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:53 |Team=AR |Event=Zach Hocker 54-yard kick good|Score= AR 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=5:08 |Team=MSU |Event=Devon Bell 24-yard kick good|Score= AR 10\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:48 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 30-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Devon Bell kick good|Score= Tie 10\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=3:28 |Team=AR |Event=Julian Horton 22-yard touchdown run, Zach Hocker kick good|Score= AR 17\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=13:35 |Team=MSU |Event=Jameon Lewis 5-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Russell, Devon Bell kick good|Score= Tie 17\u201317}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=MSU |Event=Damian Williams 25-yard touchdown run, Devon Bell kick good|Score= MSU 24\u201317|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

True Freshman and third-string quarterback Damian Williams scored on a 25-yard touchdown run on the first play of overtime, and the Mississippi State defense made it stand, as the Bulldogs defeated Arkansas 24\u201317 on Saturday at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock.\n\nMississippi State (5\u20136, 2\u20135 Southeastern Conference) got an interception by Taveze Calhoun on fourth down to seal the victory and keep its bowl hopes alive. Arkansas gained only one yard on its first three plays, and Calhoun stepped in front of the receiver and snared Brandon Allen's pass, returning it across midfield before being tackled. The Bulldogs lost to Arkansas in overtime contests in 1996, 2000 and 2010, all in Starkville, Miss., and had never defeated the Razorbacks in Arkansas. Mississippi State's best result in the Natural State was a 13\u201313 tie in 1993. Arkansas still leads the all-time series 15\u20138\u20131. The Bulldogs can become bowl eligible with a win over rival Ole Miss on Thanksgiving night in Starkville.\n\nMississippi State had a chance to win the game in regulation, but Devon Bell's 42-yard field goal drifted wide right with 24 seconds remaining. That came after Arkansas (3\u20138, 0\u20137) failed to cash in on its own chance to take the lead late in regulation. With the score tied 17\u201317, Allen passed to [[Jeremy Sprinkle]] for 44 yards to the Mississippi State 12. But Alex Collins fumbled on the next play, and Nickoe Whitley recovered for the Bulldogs at the Arkansas 9.\n\nThe Razorbacks took the opening kick and went 56 yards for a touchdown. After Korliss Marshall's kick return gave the Razorbacks a short field, they quickly moved into Mississippi State territory. Javontee Herndon scored, also on an end around, and Arkansas led 7\u20130. Zach Hocker added a career-best 54-yard field goal in the second quarter to make it 10\u20130. Arkansas led 10\u20130 in the first half, but was unable to maintain the lead and lost its eighth consecutive game for the first time in school history. The Bulldogs countered in the final minutes of the second quarter. Bell's 24-yard field goal got them on the scoreboard with 5:08 left. Russell then found LaDarius Perkins on a play action down the middle of the field for a 30-yard touchdown to pull the Bulldogs even.\n\nAfter a first half that ended in a 10\u201310 tie, the Razorbacks took a 17\u201310 lead on a 22-yard run by Julian Horton in the third quarter on an end around. The Bulldogs answered immediately, covering 75 yards in 11 plays, as Tyler Russell connected with Jameon Lewis for a 5-yard touchdown on third down to knot the score. Russell completed 18 of 28 passes for 263 yards and two scores before leaving the game late in regulation with an apparent shoulder injury. Josh Robinson had 17 carries for 101 yards. Arkansas rushed for 225 yards as a team, spread out among nine ball carriers, but managed only 114 yards passing.\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{See also|2013 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Egg Bowl}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegePrimaryStyle|Mississippi State Bulldogs|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=Ole Miss Rebels (7\u20134) at Mississippi State Bulldogs (5\u20136)\n|date=November 28, 2013\n|time=6:30 p.m. [[Central Standard Time|CST]]\n|road=[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=3 |R4=0 |R5=0\n|home='''[[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi St]]'''\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=0 |H4=3 |H5=7\n|stadium=[[Davis Wade Stadium]], [[Starkville, Mississippi]]\n|attendance=55,113\n|weather=\n|referee=Marc Curles\n|TV=[[ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime|ESPN]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Rece Davis]], [[Jesse Palmer]], [[David Pollack]], and [[Maria Taylor (analyst)|Maria Taylor]]\n|reference=[https://hailstate.com/documents/2014/2/24/ms1128.htm Box Score]\n|scoring=\n'''Second quarter'''\n*MSU \u2013 Josh Robinson 1-yard run (Evan Sobiesk kick), 1:36.

Injured shoulder and all, the sophomore quarterback did just that, running for a 3-yard touchdown in overtime to lead the Bulldogs past rival Mississippi 17\u201310 on a chilly Thursday night at Davis Wade Stadium. Prescott didn't enter the game until the fourth quarter because of a nerve injury to his non-throwing arm that caused him to miss the previous two games. But the sophomore led the Bulldogs (6\u20136, 3\u20135 Southeastern Conference) to their tying drive in the fourth quarter and the game winner in overtime. Prescott completed 11 of 20 passes for 115 yards in a performance that will long be remembered in Egg Bowl lore. His game-winning touchdown came on a gutsy call by Mullen, who opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 at the 3 instead of kicking a short field goal. It was an emotional win for the Bulldogs and especially Prescott, whose mother died earlier this month after a yearlong battle with cancer.\n\nOle Miss had a chance to tie the game in overtime, but the drive ended when quarterback [[Bo Wallace]] fumbled and Mississippi State's Jamerson Love recovered the ball in the end zone. The Bulldogs are now bowl eligible for a fourth straight season, the longest streak in school history. Mississippi State has won four of the past five Egg Bowls and five in a row at Davis Wade Stadium.\n\nMississippi State Freshman Damian Williams, the third-string quarterback, made his first career start because of injuries to Prescott and Tyler Russell. He completed 8 of 18 passes for 82 yards and one interception. Both teams struggled to move the ball in the chilly conditions \u2013 especially through the air. The temperature hovered in the low 30s throughout the night, which is downright frigid by Magnolia State standards. Ole Miss (7\u20135, 3\u20135) didn't have an offensive touchdown, scoring only on a field goal and blocked punt in the end zone. The Rebels ended the regular season on a two-game losing streak. The Rebels had one good early drive but it ended with nothing after Andrew Ritter's 27-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright.\n\nWallace threw three interceptions before halftime, and the final one was costly. Mississippi State's Justin Cox grabbed it at the Ole Miss 30, and the Bulldogs' subsequent drive ended with Josh Robinson's 1-yard touchdown run for a 7\u20130 lead with 1:32 remaining in the second quarter. Ole Miss did nothing on its next possession and quickly punted back to Mississippi State, which looked as though it would ease into halftime with the lead. But a mistake on special teams hurt the Bulldogs when Collins Moore burst through the line and blocked Baker Swedenburg's punt after the snap was bobbled. It was recovered by little-used senior Terrell Grant in the end zone to tie the game at 7.\nOle Miss grabbed the lead for the first time early in the third quarter after Ritter's 22-yard field goal gave the Rebels a 10\u20137 advantage. The points were certainly welcome for the Ole Miss offense, but it was the team's fifth straight trip to the red zone without a touchdown, dating back to last weekend's loss to Missouri.\n\nThat lack of efficiency came back to haunt the Rebels. Williams played decently for the Bulldogs and avoided any major mistakes, but with the offense struggling early in the fourth quarter, Mullen turned to Prescott. Mullen said earlier in the week that Prescott wouldn't play in the Egg Bowl, but he looked plenty healthy as he led the Bulldogs down the field on his second drive, completing several impressive passes. The drive ended with Sobiesk's 36-yard field goal to tie it at 10. Mississippi State received the ball one final time but Sobiesk missed a 38-yard field goal wide right at the end of regulation that would have won the game.\n\n===Rice===\n{{See also|Rice Owls football|2013 Rice Owls football team|2013 Liberty Bowl}}\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= Rice vs Mississippi State\n|Visitor=Rice\n|V1=7|V2=0|V3=0|V4=0\n|Host='''Bulldogs'''\n|H1=7|H2=20|H3=14|H4=3\n|Date= December 31\n|Location= [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]<br>[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, TN]]\n|StartTime= 3:00 PM\n|TimeZone= CST\n|ElapsedTime= 3:05\n|Attendance= 57,846\n|Weather= {{convert|47|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, Clear, winds S 7mph\n|Referee= Ron Cherry\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Bob Wischusen]], [[Rod Gilmore]] and [[Quint Kessenich]]\n|TVStation= [[ESPN]]\n}} Source:<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice Owls vs Mississippi State Bulldogs (December 31, 2013)|url=http://www.hailstate.com/fls/16800/stats/fb/2013/ms1231.htm|publisher=Mississippi State Athletics|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=1 |Time=6:41 |Team=RICE |Event=Ross Charles 1-yard touchdown run, [[Chris Boswell]] kick good|Score= Rice 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=2:01 |Team=MSU |Event=LaDarius Perkins 10-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= Tie 7\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=9:49 |Team=MSU |Event=Ashton Shumpert 1-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 14\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:32 |Team=MSU |Event=Malcolm Johnson 13-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick blocked|Score= MSU 20\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=0:10 |Team=MSU |Event=Artimas Samuel 4-yard touchdown pass from Dak Prescott, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 27\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=7:25 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 5-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 34\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=1:42 |Team=MSU |Event=Dak Prescott 11-yard touchdown run, Evan Sobiesk kick good|Score= MSU 41\u20137}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=4:45 |Team=MSU |Event=Taylor Earhart 19-yard kick good|Score= MSU 44\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Prescott threw three touchdown passes and ran for two more scores Tuesday as Mississippi State trounced Rice 44\u20137 in the most one-sided AutoZone Liberty Bowl victory in the game's 55-year history in Memphis. The sophomore quarterback delivered arguably the finest performance of his career less than two months after his mother, Peggy, died of cancer.\n\nMississippi State (7\u20136) wrapped up its fourth straight winning season and prevented Rice (10\u20134) from winning bowl games in back-to-back years for the first time. All of Mississippi State's losses this season came against teams currently in the Top 25: No. 13 Oklahoma State, No. 2 Auburn, No. 14 LSU, No. 8 South Carolina, No. 20 Texas A&M and No. 3 Alabama. The Bulldogs became bowl eligible by closing the regular season with consecutive overtime victories over Arkansas and Ole Miss. This marks the first time since 1974 that Mississippi State has closed a season with three straight wins.\n\nNobody faced more adversity than Prescott, who set a Liberty Bowl record by accounting for five touchdowns. Prescott was 17 of 28 for 283 yards passing and also ran for 78 yards on 14 carries. Prescott's performance delighted a partisan crowd of 57,846 and capped a triumphant late-season performance amid personal tragedy for the sophomore quarterback. Prescott came off the bench in the fourth quarter to lead Mississippi State to a 17\u201310 overtime victory over Ole Miss last month that earned the Bulldogs a bowl bid. Although Prescott and senior Tyler Russell had shared quarterback duties throughout the regular season, Prescott had the job to himself in the Liberty Bowl while Russell recovered from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder. Prescott responded better than anyone could have reasonably imagined.\n\nPrescott wasn't Mississippi State's only star on a night when the Bulldogs outgained Rice 533\u2013145 and scored the game's final 44 points. Mississippi State's Jameon Lewis caught nine passes for 220 yards to break the Liberty Bowl receiving record held by Houston's Vincent Marshall, who had 201 yards in a 44\u201336 loss to South Carolina in 2006. Lewis also set the school single-game record.\n\nNot to forget, the Bulldogs also played dominant defense. Rice had won the Conference USA title \u2013 its first outright league championship of any kind since 1957 \u2013 by relying on a rushing attack that was ranked 16th among all Football Bowl Subdivision teams. Rice gained only 61 yards rushing \u2013 179 below its season average \u2013 on 32 carries against Mississippi State. Charles Ross, who entered the day having rushed for 1,252 yards and 14 touchdowns this season, was held to 28 yards on 10 carries.\n\nRice took an early lead on Ross' 1-yard touchdown run, but Mississippi State took control by reaching the end zone on six of its next seven possessions. Prescott threw first-half touchdown passes to LaDarius Perkins, Malcolm Johnson and Artimus Samuel before running for two scores in the third quarter.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{See also|2013 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS football rankings\n| finalpollweek = 16 | harrisfirstweek = 7 | bcsfirstweek = 8\n| AP_pre = NR\n| coaches_pre = RV\n| AP_1 = NR\n| coaches_1 = NR\n| AP_2 = NR\n| coaches_2 = NR\n| AP_3 = NR\n| coaches_3 = NR\n| AP_4 = NR\n| coaches_4 = NR\n| AP_5 = NR\n| coaches_5 = NR\n| AP_6 = NR\n| coaches_6 = NR\n| AP_7 = NR\n| coaches_7 = NR\n| harris_7 = NR\n| AP_8 = NR\n| coaches_8 = NR\n| harris_8 = NR\n| bcs_8 = NR\n| AP_9 = NR\n| coaches_9 = NR\n| harris_9 = NR\n| bcs_9 = NR\n| AP_10 = NR\n| coaches_10 = NR\n| harris_10 = NR\n| bcs_10 = NR\n| AP_11 = NR\n| coaches_11 = NR\n| harris_11 = NR\n| bcs_11 = NR\n| AP_12 = NR\n| coaches_12 = NR\n| harris_12 = NR\n| bcs_12 = NR\n| AP_13 = NR\n| coaches_13 = NR\n| harris_13 = NR\n| bcs_13 = NR\n| AP_14 = NR\n| coaches_14 = NR\n| harris_14 = NR\n| bcs_14 = NR\n| AP_15 = NR\n| coaches_15 = NR\n| harris_15 = NR\n| bcs_15 = NR\n| AP_16 = RV\n| coaches_16 = NR\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\nPassing Stats\n\nName\tCMP\tATT\tYDS\t%\tAVG\tTD\tINT\nDak Prescott\t156\t267\t1940\t58.4\t7.27\t10\t7\nTyler Russell\t71\t109\t875\t65.1\t8.03\t5\t3\nDamian Williams\t23\t47\t279\t48.9\t5.94\t0\t2\nJameon Lewis\t3\t3\t84\t100.0\t28.0\t3\t0\n\nRushing Stats\n\nName\tCAR\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tTD\nDak Prescott\t134\t829\t6.2\t75\t13\nLaDarius Perkins\t137\t542\t4.0\t35\t2\nJosh Robinson\t78\t459\t5.9\t51\t3\nAshton Shumpert\t46\t190\t4.1\t14\t3\nJameon Lewis\t13\t117\t9.0\t44\t3\nDamian Williams\t37\t112\t3.0\t25\t1\nNick Griffin\t24\t96\t4.0\t10\t1\nDerrick Milton\t13\t69\t5.3\t14\t2\n\nReceiving Stats\n\nName\tREC\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tTD\nJameon Lewis\t64\t923\t14.4\t65\t5\nMalcolm Johnson\t30\t391\t13.0\t60\t2\nRobert Johnson\t34\t389\t11.4\t61\t0\nDe\u2019Runnya Wilson\t26\t351\t13.5\t59\t3\nLaDarius Perkins\t27\t248\t9.2\t32\t3\nJoe Morrow\t18\t211\t11.7\t31\t1\nJosh Robinson\t12\t115\t12.8\t23\t0\nFred Ross\t9\t115\t12.8\t23\t0\nBrandon Holloway\t7\t77\t11.0\t34\t0\nFred Brown\t5\t74\t14.8\t19\t0\nDak Prescott\t2\t53\t26.5\t36\t2\n\nKicking Stats\n\nName\tXPM\tXPA\tFGM\tFGA\t%\tLNG\tPTS\nDevon Bell\t25\t26\t6\t14\t42.9\t40\t43\nEvan Sobiesk\t15\t16\t3\t6\t50.0\t38\t24\n\nPunting Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tLNG\tI-20\nBlake Swedenberg\t25\t1063\t42.4\t53\t6\nDevon Bell\t24\t990\t41.2\t62\t14\n\nKick Returning Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tTD\tLNG\nJameon Lewis\t19\t446\t23.5\t0\t66\nRobert Johnson\t4\t41\t10.2\t0\t19\nBrandon Holloway\t3\t113\t37.7\t0\t95\nChris Harrison\t1\t7\t7.0\t0\t7\n\nPunt Return Stats\n\nName\tATT\tYDS\tAVG\tTD\tLNG\nJameon Lewis\t22\t51\t2.3\t0\t16\nBrandon Holloway\t2\t36\t18.0\t0\t23\n\nDefensive Stats\n\nName\tSOLO\tAST\tTKL\tTFL\tSACKS\tINT\tFUM\nBrandon McKinney\t42\t29\t71\t7\t3.5\t0\t2\nDeontae Skinner\t33\t31\t64\t4.5\t1\t1\t0\nKendrick Market\t43\t19\t62\t1.5\t0\t0\t0\nNikoe Whitley\t38\t17\t55\t1\t0\t5\t1\nMatthew Wells\t28\t22\t50\t6\t1\t0\t2\nTaveze Calhoun\t33\t12\t45\t1.5\t0\t3\t1\nPreston Smith\t29\t15\t44\t6.5\t2.5\t0\t0\nBeniquez Brown\t16\t23\t39\t4.5\t0\t0\t2\nRichie Brown\t16\t22\t38\t3\t2\t1\t0\nZach Jackson\t16\t17\t33\t2.5\t0\t0\t0\nChris Jones\t17\t15\t32\t7\t3\t0\t0\nDenico Autry\t14\t17\t31\t6.5\t2\t0\t0\nJustin Cox\t23\t8\t31\t0.5\t0\t1\t0\nJamerson Love\t22\t5\t27\t1\t0\t3\t1\nKaleb Eulls\t9\t17\t26\t1.5\t0\t0\t0\nP.J.

The Rebels entered the season with a #17 ranking in the AP Poll and as 39.5 point favorites in their season opener. The Rebels dominated the Skyhawks in the opener from the very beginning, when running back Jaylen Walton scored Ole Miss's first points of the year on a 60-yd touchdown run only four minutes into the game. The Rebels only led 6\u20130, however, after a failed two point conversion. Walton would get his second touchdown of the game after he found the end zone four yards out which put the Rebels up 13\u20130 with 6:42 left in the first quarter. Ole Miss's first passing touchdown would occur when new Junior quarterback Chad Kelly would find Markell Pack for a 56-yd touchdown strike with 5:28 remaining, which put Ole Miss up 20\u20130 with one third of the first quarter left. The Rebels' final score of the first quarter would come when quarterback Ryan Buchanan would find wide receiver [[Quincy Adeboyejo]] for a 15-yd touchdown strike, putting the Rebels up 27\u20130 at the end of the first quarter. The second quarter would feature two more passing touchdowns by the Rebels, the first of which was a surprising 31-yd touchdown pass from Ryan Buchanan to defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche with 12:35 left in the half. Second one would come when Chad Kelly would find [[Cody Core]] for a 57-yd touchdown pass to put Rebels up 41\u20130 going into halftime. The first points of the second half would happen when defensive back Trae Elston would intercept the Skyhawks when they were in the red zone and he would return it 93 yards for another Ole Miss score with 9:09 left in the third quarter. The next points would come when Chad Kelly would run in it from 20 yards out to put the Rebels up 55\u20130 with 4:56 left in the third quarter. Tennessee\u2212Martin's first and only points of the game would come when kicker Jackson Redditt would make it 29 yards out. The Rebels led 55\u20133 heading into the fourth quarter. Quarterback Devante Kincade would score for the first time of the game when he found receiver DaMarkus Lodge 12 yards out to put Ole Miss up 62\u20133 only four and a half minutes into the fourth quarter. Ole Miss's last two touchdowns of the game would come on the ground, when Eugene Brazley would run in it from 70 yards out and D.K. Buford would find the end zone from 20 yards out. Ole Miss won the game by a final score of 76\u20133, which was the most points Ole Miss scored in any game since 1935.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Fresno State\n|R1=0 ||R2=14 ||R3=7 ||R4=0 ||RT=21\n|Home='''#17 Ole Miss'''\n|H1=28 ||H2=7 ||H3=21 ||H4=17 ||HT=73\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The Rebels put up 28 points in the first quarter, which was the most points scored in a single quarter in Ole Miss history. Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly was responsible for all four of Ole Miss's touchdowns, the first one coming only three minutes into the game when Kelly found Cody Core in the end zone for a fourteen-yard touchdown strike. Kelly's next touchdown would come on the ground, when he would run it in from four yards out. The Rebels had a 14\u20130 with 8:26 remaining in the first quarter. Kelly's first of three touchdown passes to Quincy Adeboyejo would come from 16 yards out with 4:30 left, and the second one would soon follow when Kelly found him from 50 yards out. Ole Miss entered the second quarter with 28\u20130 lead. The first points of the second quarter would come when Ole Miss quarterback Ryan Buchanan would be intercepted by Shannon Edwards, and that interception would be returned for a touchdown to give the Bulldogs their first points. Kelly would come back in the game, and hit Adeboyejo once more for a 44-yard touchdown pass to put Ole Miss up 35\u20137 with 4:15 remaining in the half. The half's final points would be scored by the Bulldogs as time expired, when Fresno State quarterback Chason Virgil would find Josiah Blandin from nine yards out to pull to within 21 points at the break. Robert Nkemdiche would open the second half with an offensive score, after he ran the ball in from a yard out. The Ole Miss defense would score its first points when Trae Elston would intercept Virgil and return it for a 38-yard touchdown, to put Ole Miss up 49\u201314. Ole Miss would get its second rushing touchdown of the game when [[Akeem Judd]] ran it in from 27 yards out to put Ole Miss up 56\u201314. The Bulldogs, however, would score the quarter's final points when Virgil would find Marteze Waller from seven yards out to trim the lead to 56\u201321 heading into the final quarter of play. Ole Miss would get its only field of the game when kicker Gary Wunderlich would split the uprights to put the Rebels up 59\u201321, and it wouldn't be much longer before the Rebels scored once again, when running back Eugene Brazley would find the end zone from six yards out to put Ole Miss up 66\u201321. And it would the landshark defense of Ole Miss who would score the game's final points, when Ford Childress would intercept Virgil and return it 22 yards to win the game, 73\u201321. Ole Miss would become the first SEC team to ever score 70 points in back to back games.<ref>https://www.si.com/game/9963961/box-score</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===#2 [[2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]===\n{{See also|Alabama\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''#15 Ole Miss'''\n|R1= 3||R2= 14||R3= 13||R4= 13\n|Home=#2 Alabama\n|H1= 0||H2= 10||H3= 7||H4= 20\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

However, Ole Miss would be the team who never trailed in the entire game. On the opening kickoff, Alabama fumbled the ball which led to an early Ole Miss field goal only about thirty seconds in, but that would be the only score of the first quarter. The Tide knotted the game up at 3 when Adam Griffith hit a field from twenty yards out with 12:20 left in the second quarter. The Rebels would be responsible for the game's first two touchdowns, when Jordan Wilkins ran it in from one yard on fourth and goal with 7:30 remaining in the first half. Chad Kelly would run it in next, this time from four yards out to put Ole Miss up 17\u20133 with 6:43 left in the half. Alabama managed to put one touchdown on the board before the half, as Ole Miss led at the half, 17\u201310. The first points of the second half would come on an outrageous pass from Chad Kelly to Quincy Adeboyejo from 66 yards out, to put Ole Miss up 24\u201310 with 12:53 left in the third quarter. Ole Miss would then tack on two Gary Wunderlich field goals, one from 34 yards out and one from 45 yards out, which put the Rebels up 30\u201310 with four minutes left in the third quarter. The Tide would score the quarter's final points, when quarterback [[Jake Coker]] would run it in with 1:33 left. Alabama would pull to within six points when Coker would find [[ArDarius Stewart]] from eight yards out with 12:30 left in the game. Ole Miss's next big play would come when Chad Kelly would find a wide open Cody Core for a 73-yd touchdown strike less than a minute after Alabama pulled to within six. After a failed two point conversion, The Rebels led 36\u201324. Ole Miss would score again when Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from 24 yards out following an Alabama interception to put the Rebels up 43\u201324. The Tide would score with 6:36 left in the game when running back [[Derrick Henry]] would find the end zone from two yards out to bring the Tide to within 13. Alabama would also fail on a two-point conversion try, so the score remained 43\u201330. Alabama surprisingly recovered the onside kick that followed, and capitalized with a touchdown from Coker to [[Richard Mullaney]] with four and half minutes left. Ole Miss led 43\u201337. After the next Ole Miss drive stalled, Alabama got the ball back down by six points with three minutes left. Their game-winning drive, however, would be terminated by an interception from Coker. Alabama got one final chance with 31 seconds left at their own 30 yard line, but failed to get a first down. Ole Miss beat Alabama in back to back seasons for the first time ever and won in Tuscaloosa for the second time ever.  Following Ole Miss's upset win, the Rebels rose to #3 in the rankings, which was the first time since 1963\u201364 that Ole Miss was ranked in the top 3 in back to back seasons.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]]===\n{{See also|Vanderbilt\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Vanderbilt\n|R1= 3||R2= 0||R3= 10||R4= 3||RT= 16\n|Home='''#3 Ole Miss'''\n|H1= 7||H2= 6||H3= 7||H4= 7||HT= 27\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

However, the game itself was much closer than the experts, the team and the fans anticipated. Ole Miss came in with the highest offensive efficiency in country, but struggled to move the ball against a greatly improved Vanderbilt defense. Ole Miss QB Chad Kelly threw an interception on the Rebels' first drive of the game, and the team that had scored 192 points through the first three games had failed to put up any points at all through the first twelve minutes of the first quarter. The Commodores moved the ball well on their final drive of the first quarter, but settled for a field goal, as Vanderbilt went up 3\u20130 with 3:25 left in the opening quarter. This would become the first time all season that Ole Miss trailed in a game. However, the game's first touchdown would come from Chad Kelly to wide receiver [[Damore'ea Stringfellow]] with roughly two minutes left in the first quarter. Ole Miss would return to the red zone following a Vanderbilt punt, but because of a 10-yard holding penalty on third down, the Rebels were forced to settle for a field goal, as Gary Wunderlich scored his first points for Ole Miss of the night from 19 yards out with five and a half minutes left of the half. Vanderbilt would once again fail to consistently move the ball on their next possession, which resulted in another punt. On the ensuing drive, Ole Miss would be the team with red zone offensive difficulties, as the Rebels could not put the ball in the end zone, and settled for a field goal. That would be the final score of the half, and Ole Miss went to the locker room with a 13\u20133 lead. Vanderbilt opened the second half with one of their most productive drives of the game, with big passes from quarterback Johnny McCrary, as the Commodores managed a field goal from 41 yards out. Ole Miss would soon return to the red zone not much longer after, thanks to a moderately effective running game and some big plays through the air. However, the Rebels once again would fail to find the end zone, as they were forced to settle for what was seemingly a guaranteed 29 yard Gary Wunderlich field goal. However, what would've been another three points for the Rebels didn't happen due to a Nifae Lealao block on the kick. The score stalled at 13\u20136. Vanderbilt would produce another highly productive drive thanks to an efficient running game, this time resulting in a touchdown pass from Johnny McCrary to [[Ralph Webb (American football)|Ralph Webb]] from seven yards out with eight and half minutes left in the third quarter. With the score tied at 13\u201313, Ole Miss fans at the game were visibly starting to get restless as the 26.5 point underdog Vanderbilt Commodores were proving to be a worthy opponent. After Ole Miss punted on the following drive, Vanderbilt's next drive would also result in a punt. However, the Commodores' punt was blocked, which would lead to Ole Miss's second of three touchdowns in the game with 1:30 left in the third quarter. Ole Miss entered the final phase of the game with a narrow one touchdown lead. Despite many chances to force a Vanderbilt punt on third down, the Commodores managed to produce another effective drive and got deep into Ole Miss territory. Although they failed to tie the game at 20, the Commodores tightened the game by pulling to within four points with 12:25 left in the fourth quarter. After another Ole Miss drive stalled, the Commodores got the ball back and again, moved the ball very well. They once again reached the red zone, but couldn't get past the goal line. The settled for what should've been an easy field goal, but Tommy Openshaw, the Commodores' kicker, missed from 32 yards out. On Ole Miss's ensuing drive, they finally managed to move the ball much more productively than they had before. The Rebels found the end zone for a third and final time in the game, increasing their lead to 27\u201316 with about seven minutes left in the game. Vanderbilt's final drive, although they moved the ball decently, ended after failing to convert on fourth down. Ole Miss would get a small handful of first downs on the ensuing drive then kneel the rest of the game to seal the victory. Ole Miss improved to 4\u20130 on the year and 2\u20130 in conference play. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===#25 [[2015 Florida Gators football team|Florida]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=#3 Ole Miss\n|R1= 0||R2= 0||R3= 3||R4= 7||RT=\n|Home='''#25 Florida'''\n|H1= 13||H2= 12||H3= 0||H4= 13||HT=\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Ole Miss entered the game as 7.5 point favorites, but never had the lead at any point in the game. Florida opened the scoring with 9:09 remaining in the first quarter on 36 yard touchdown pass from [[Will Grier]] to [[Demarcus Robinson]], which would be the first passing play of 20+ yards that the Rebels have given up all year. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, it would only a take a small handful of plays by the Florida defense to force a Jaylen Walton fumble, which would lead to Florida's second touchdown of the game and the final points of the first quarter. The extra point was no good, however, so the score remained 13\u20130 heading into the second phase of the game. After failing to score once again, Florida would get the ball back and would yet again find the end zone on a deep pass from Will Grier (77 yards out) to [[Brandon Powell]] in a drive that lasted less than a minute. Florida would attempt the two point conversion to make up for the missed PAT, but failed on the try, so Florida led 19\u20130. The Rebels would once again fail to productively move the ball on offense, so Florida regained possession once again before the half, and managed another touchdown before heading into the locker room with 20 seconds left on a pass from Grier to [[Antonio Callaway]] from fifteen yards out. Florida, once again, would attempt and fail on the two point conversion, so the score was 25\u20130 at halftime. After multiple miscues, failed opportunities, (a missed 29 yard field goal among them) and red zone failures, The Rebels opened up the second half in an effort to correct those mistakes. The Ole Miss defense was successful in shutting out the Florida offense in the third quarter, but the Rebels' offense would only manage a field goal with 5:25 left in the third quarter. Florida opened up the fourth quarter with a pair of field goals of the own, from 31 and 22 yards out, respectively. Florida would find the end zone once again on a Jordan Cronkrite run from one yard out, to extend Florida's lead to 38\u20133. Ole Miss would score their first and only touchdown on a seven-yard Markell Pack pass from Chad Kelly with 4:04 left in the game, but it was too little too late. Ole Miss would lose their first game of the year in the Swamp by four touchdowns.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 New Mexico State Aggies football team|New Mexico State]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=New Mexico State\n|R1=3 ||R2=0 ||R3=0 ||R4=0 ||RT=3\n|Home='''#14 Ole Miss'''\n|H1=17 ||H2=14 ||H3=14 ||H4=7 ||HT=52\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Ole Miss received the ball first and moved the ball very well on their opening drive, but similar to what happened multiple times in the previous two games against Florida and Vanderbilt, failed to get in the end zone and settled for an early Gary Wunderlich field goal from 21 yards out with 11:25 left in the opening quarter. On the Aggies' ensuing possession, they were able to match Ole Miss's field goal with a Parker Davidson kick of their own, from 39 yards out with 4:24 left. With the score tied 3\u20133, Ole Miss got the ball back and found the end zone for a second time on a Jordan Wilkins touchdown run from eleven yards out with roughly three minutes remaining in the first quarter. Ole Miss would get the ball back again in the first quarter, and found the end zone once again on a three-yard Akeem Judd as time expired. The second quarter didn't see as much scoring, as the first points of the second quarter of play didn't come until there was slightly less than six minutes left in the half, when Chad Kelly would complete his first touchdown strike to Markell Pack from 66 yards out. The Rebels managed to increase their lead to 31\u20133 with under two minutes remaining in the half when Chad Kelly would get his first rushing touchdown of the game from four yards out, and the Rebels took their 31\u20133 lead to the locker room. After another slow start by the offenses in the third quarter, the Rebels got to the end zone after nine and half minutes expired Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from twenty yards out to put the Rebels up 38\u20133. It wouldn't be long before Ole Miss found the end zone once again, when Kelly would once again hook up with Treadwell from 37 yards out to increase their lead 45\u20133. The fourth quarter would only feature one score, which was by the Ole Miss offense when running back Eugene Brazley would run it in from 78 yards out. Ole Miss rebounded nicely from a very poor performance against Florida with a 52\u20133 victory against New Mexico State.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]]===\n{{See also|Memphis\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road= #13 Ole Miss\n|R1= 14||R2= 0||R3= 10||R4= 0\n|Home= '''Memphis'''\n|H1= 7||H2= 17||H3= 7||H4= 6\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

It didn't take long for Ole Miss's high powered offense to find the end zone, when wide receiver Laquon Treadwell threw it on a bootleg to Quincy Adeboyejo only twenty seconds into the game from 68 yards out to give the rebels the early 7\u20130 lead. After the ensuing Memphis drive stalled, Ole Miss received the ball again, and once again, the Rebels found the end zone thanks to their explosive offense. This time, quarterback Chad Kelly found Damore'ea Stringfellow from 23 yards out with 9:44 left in the first quarter to put the rebels up 14\u20130, in a game that was seemingly turning into a blowout. However, Memphis's quarterback [[Paxton Lynch]] demonstrated why he was regarded as one of the best quarterbacks in the country when he led the Tigers' offense on 65 yard drive that resulted in a touchdown on a one-yard pass from Lynch to Alan Cross with 2:12 left in the first quarter. After several drives stalled in the second quarter, Memphis managed to reach the red zone again, but settled for a 23-yard Jake Elliot field goal with 4:20 to go in the half, to pull the tigers to within four. Memphis soon regained possession following a Chad Kelly interception, and effectively moved the ball once again. Memphis found the end zone with 2:52 remaining in the half when Sam Craft ran it in from four yards out. On Ole Miss's next drive, Hugh Freeze boldly decided to go for it on their own 34 yard line, but was unsuccessful. This resulted in Memphis's final touchdown of the half when Paxton Lynch found Anthony Miller from six yards out to put the tigers up 24\u201314 heading into the locker room. Memphis received the ball to start the second half, and it didn't take much for Lynch to put up more points for Memphis when he found Mose Frazier from 31 yards out for another score to put Memphis up 31\u201314. Ole Miss, desperately needing a score, got the ball back and was finally able to move it the ball efficiently. Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from six yards out to pull the rebels to within ten. Ole Miss soon received the ball once again following a Memphis punt and, with 21 seconds remaining, managed a 24-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal to pull to within seven heading into the final quarter. The fourth quarter didn't see as much action, as both offenses were inconsistent. Memphis managed to field goal from 42 yards out to make go up two possessions again, and after another Ole Miss drive stalled, got the ball back and tacked on another three point, this time from 27 yards out with 58 seconds left in the game. Ole Miss lost to Memphis for the first time since 2004 and lost to an unranked non SEC opponent for the first time since 1979. Memphis, on the other hand, beat a ranked team for the first time since 1996.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===#15 [[2015 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=#15 Texas A&M\n|R1=0 ||R2=3 ||R3=0 ||R4=0 ||RT=3\n|Home='''#24 Ole Miss'''\n|H1=7 ||H2=9 ||H3=7 ||H4=0 ||HT=23\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Ole Miss was six point favorites despite the loss against Memphis the week before. Texas A&M received the ball first, and despite a few first downs, the aggies were forced to punt. Ole Miss's first drive of the evening featured multiple big runs and big completions, but came up empty handed when kicker Gary Wunderlich missed a 44-yard field goal. After a quick three and out by the aggie offense, Ole Miss got the ball back and capitalized on a Chad Kelly touchdown pass to tight end Evan Engram from seven yards out with 2:33 remaining in the first quarter. Texas A&M once again failed to move the ball effectively resulting in another punt, so Ole Miss got the ball back once again. Despite moving the ball relatively well, the rebels settled for a 41-yard Wunderlich field goal and went up 10\u20130. On Texas A&M's ensuing possession, running back [[Tra Carson]] fumbled and the rebels recovered, giving Ole Miss good field position at the Texas A&M 33 yard line. This led to another Gary Wunderlich field goal, this time from 30 yards out, to put Ole Miss up 13\u20130. Each team's next drive stalled and Texas A&M received the ball again with four minutes left in the half, and managed a [[Taylor Bertolet]] field goal from 44 yards out to pull to within 16\u20133, which would be the halftime score. Each team's first two drives resulted in punts, which ran off the first five minutes of the half. Ole Miss got the ball with ten minutes left, and Chad Kelly completed a deep pass to receiver Laquon Treadwell from 58 yards out which resulted in a touchdown, putting Ole Miss up 23\u20133. The rest of the third quarter featured multiple punts by both teams and a Chad Kelly interception, but no scores. Texas A&M had the ball to open up the final quarter, but following one Kyle Allen completion for \u20132 yards and two other incompletions, the aggies were forced to punt. Ole Miss's opening drive of the fourth quarter nearly mirrored Texas A&M's, as it also resulted in a punt. On Texas A&M's next drive, despite moving the ball relatively well, failed to convert on fourth down, and Ole Miss got the ball back. The rebels' ensuing possession would end very quickly when Donovan Wilson would intercept Chad Kelly with 6:51 left in the game.

The Rebels received the ball to open the game and despite making it to the red zone, the Rebels were forced to settle for a 27-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal to open up the scoring with a 3\u20130 lead. The next score would come from the Tigers who received the ball with very good field position, but failed to get a first down. The Tigers would still be able to attempt a field goal from 52 yards out despite not getting a first down thanks to where they started on the field. Kicker Daniel Carlson made it from 52 yards out, tying the game at with 3 with four minutes remaining in the first quarter. It wouldn't take much time in the second quarter for the Tigers to get their next score, as quarterback Sean White hit Ricardo Louis from 47 yards out for a score, which was White's first touchdown pass of the year. The Rebels were able to tie the game at 10, however, when running back Akeem Judd ran it in from 25 yards out with four minutes remaining in the first half. The Rebels went to the locker room tied 10\u201310 with the Tigers. Ole Miss received the ball to begin the second half, and offensive red zone struggles continued when the Rebels had to settle for a field from 37 yards out from Wunderlich, giving the Rebels a 13\u201310 lead. On Auburn's next possession, they would experience the same difficulties, when kicker Carlson would tie the game up at 13 with a 23-yard kick with just under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly would get his first touchdown pass of the day when he found Derrick Jones from 45 yards out to put Ole Miss up 20\u201313 with just under two minutes remaining in the third. A pair of Carlson field goals would soon follow, from 33 and 26 yards out respectively with twelve minutes left in the game. Kelly would find receiver Laquon Treadwell from 21 yards out to put Ole Miss up by eight with ten minutes remaining. Throughout the rest of the game, Auburn would fail to find the end zone, giving the Rebels the 27\u201319 victory. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]]===\n{{See also|Arkansas\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Arkansas'''\n|R1=7 ||R2=10 ||R3=14 ||R4=14 ||R5=8 ||RT=53\n|Home=#18 Ole Miss\n|H1=7 ||H2=10 ||H3=14 ||H4=14 ||H5=7 ||HT=52\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Arkansas received the ball first and quarterback Brandon Allen found receiver Drew Morgan from 31 yards out to give the Razorbacks the early 7\u20130 lead with 4:46 remaining in the first quarter. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, running back Jaylen Walton found the end zone from three yards out, tying the game at 7, which would be the quarter's last points. The next score would come near the midway point in the second quarter, when Allen would find Dominique Reed from fifteen yards out to put the Razorbacks back up by a touchdown. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, quarterback Chad Kelly would run the ball in the end zone from eleven yards out to tie the game at fourteen. Arkansas kicker Cole Hedlund would get in on the action on the Razorbacks' ensuing possession, when he made his longest kick of the season from 45 yards out. The Rebels were able to do just enough on their final drive of the half when kicker Gary Wunderlich made a 37-yard field goal as time expired. Chad Kelly would get his first passing touchdown of the game when he would find receiver Damore'ea Stringfellow from 23 yards out with 13:09 left in the third quarter. The Razorbacks would respond receiver Jared Cornelius would catch a touchdown pass from Allen from 30 yards out to tie the game once again at 24. Kelly would lead another successful Rebels' drive and would end it himself when he ran it in from three yards out to put the Rebels up 31\u201324 with seven and a half minutes left. The Razorbacks would soon tie it up again, this time at 31 with running back Kody Walker would find the end zone from three yards out. Arkansas would regain the lead when Drew Morgan would catch a pass from Brandon Allen from ten yards out, to put Arkansas up 38\u201331 shortly after the fourth quarter began. Ole Miss receiver Laquon Treadwell would catch a pass from seventeen yards out to tie it at 38, and the Rebels would finally get a defensive stop which led to another Ole Miss touchdown, this time it would Kelly finding Quincy Adeboyejo from eighteen yards out with roughly five minutes remaining. Arkansas, however, would score the game-tying touchdown when Allen would find Reed from seventeen yards out with 53 seconds left, and the game went to overtime. Ole Miss received the ball to start, and Chad Kelly would find the end zone on an eight-yard run to put Ole Miss up 52\u201345. On Arkansas's ensuing possession, the Razorbacks were faced with a 4th and 25, and the game was seemingly over. However, following a lateral pass, running back [[Alex Collins (American football)|Alex Collins]] found a hole in the Ole Miss defense and was able to convert. This was followed by an Arkansas touchdown and a successful two point conversion, which gave Arkansas the 53\u201352 OT win, stunning a sellout crowd in Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===LSU===\n{{See also|2015 LSU Tigers football team|Magnolia Bowl}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ole Miss Rebels|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=#15 LSU Tigers (7\u20132) at #22 Ole Miss Rebels (7\u20133)\n|date=November 21, 2015\n|time=2:30 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time|EST]]\n|road=[[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=10 |R4=0\n|home='''[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]'''\n|H1=3 |H2=21 |H3=14 |H4=0\n|stadium=[[Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium]], [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n|attendance=60,705\n|weather=Cloudy, {{convert|46|F|C}}\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV=[[SEC on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Verne Lundquist]], [[Gary Danielson]], and [[Tracy Wolfson]]\n|reference=[https://olemisssports.com/sports/football/stats/2015/-15-lsu/boxscore/3737 Box Score]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*MISS \u2013 Gary Wunderlich 32-yard field goal, 12:41.

The Rebels entered the Magnolia Bowl having lost ten of their last thirteen games against the Tigers, but won two of their last three home games in this series. The Rebels opened with a 32-yard field goal by Gary Wunderlich two minutes into the game, and following solid defensive play in the remainder of the first quarter the Rebels brought their 3-point lead into the second phase of the game, where running back Jaylen Walton ran it in from two yards out with 12:30 to go in the half. The next score would come from quarterback [[Chad Kelly]], who also would run it in, this time from six yards out. This put Ole Miss up 17\u20130. The Tigers once again failed to productively move the ball offensively, and when the Rebels got the ball back, they would once again score to take a commanding 17\u20130 lead. The Ole Miss defense would once again keep the Tigers from scoring, which ultimately led to yet another Ole Miss touchdown, putting the Rebels up 24\u20130. Brandon Harris, the LSU quarterback made one big play right before the half, finding Tyon Johnson from 39 yards out to pull to within 24\u20137 going into the locker room. LSU opened scoring in the second half only two minutes in, when kicker Trent Domingue hit a 43-yard field goal to pull the Tigers to within two touchdowns. The ensuing kickoff would be fumbled by Ole Miss return man Jaylen Walton, which set the Tigers up deep in Ole Miss territory. With roughly ten minutes remaining the quarter, LSU running back [[Leonard Fournette]] fumbled the ball on the way to a score, but William Clapp of LSU recovered the ball in the end zone to secure the touchdown, which put LSU down only by one touchdown. The Rebels would pull away once again, however, when quarterback Chad Kelly led a very productive drive which resulted in the quarterback running the ball in the end zone for a second time to put Ole Miss back up by two touchdowns, 31\u201317 with seven and a half minutes remaining. Ole Miss seemingly secured the victory when Kelly found tight end Evan Engram on a 3rd & 14 from 36 yards out for a score, putting Ole Miss up 38\u201317 at the end of the third quarter.

They were also looking to get their first win in Starkville since 2003, and hoping to beat the Bulldogs twice in a row for the first time since 2003\u201304. Following a fumble by Mississippi State quarterback [[Dak Prescott]], Ole Miss went up first when quarterback Chad Kelly ran the ball in from 27 yards out to go up 7\u20130. The Ole Miss defense kept the Bulldogs from scoring and provided its offense with another opportunity to score, which they did when Kelly found receiver [[Damore'ea Stringfellow]] from two yards out to go up 14\u20130. The defense of Ole Miss would put up its first points when defensive back Tony Bridges intercepted Prescott and ran it back for a touchdown to give the Rebels a commanding 21\u20130 lead. On the Bulldogs' first productive possession (which was also the first drive of the second quarter) they found the red zone but ultimately settled for a field goal to pull to within 18 points. On Ole Miss's next drive, Kelly once again found Stringfellow, with just under 11 minutes to go in the half from 36 yards out. Ole Miss would take their 28\u20133 lead into the locker room. Mississippi State found the end zone on the first drive of the second half on a one-yard Prescott run to cut the lead to 28\u201310, on kept an explosive Ole Miss offense out of the end zone the ensuing drive. Mississippi State found the red zone again, but had to settle for a field goal, cutting the lead to 28\u201313. The Rebels followed with a Gary Wunderlich 48 yard field goal to close out the third quarter, which gave the Rebels a 31\u201313 lead entering the final phase of the game, where they struck first when running back Jordan Wilkins ran it in from 39 yards out. Mississippi State responded when Prescott found Malik Dear from 13 yards out, and once again found Dear nearly eight minutes later to cut the lead to only 11 points. But, with less than two minutes left, it was too little too late, as Ole Miss secured a 38\u201327 victory, their first win in Starkville since 2003 and the first time they beat LSU and Mississippi State in the same season since 2008.

The late season victories got them a second consecutive [[New Year's Six]] bowl berth, this time playing the [[2016 Sugar Bowl|Allstate Sugar Bowl]] for the first time since 1970 and with a #12 ranking in the College Football Playoff. The Rebels were seven and a half point favorites entering the game over #16 Oklahoma State. Ole Miss got the ball to start, and the Cowboys' defense intercepted Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly on the first Rebel possession, which led to a Ben Grogan 26\u2013yard field goal to put the Cowboys up 3\u20130 with roughly five minutes left in the first quarter. Ole Miss got the board with 2:20 remaining in the first quarter with a field goal of their own from kicker Gary Wunderlich, from 34 yards out. The Rebels would wrap up scoring in the first quarter when Kelly found a wide open Cody Core from 31 yards out to give Ole Miss the 10\u20133 lead at the end of the quarter. It wouldn't be much longer before the explosive Ole Miss offense found the end zone again, when Kelly found top receiver Laquon Treadwell from 34 yards out with 11 and a half minutes left in the half to put the Rebels up 17\u20133. Kelly would soon find Treadwell again, this time from 10 yards out with just under seven minutes remaining to put Ole Miss up 24\u20133. Kicker Gary Wunderlich would be the next scorer for the Rebels, making a 38 yards field goal with 3:44 left in the half. The Cowboys would score next with a field goal of their own, form 31 yards out with a minute and a half remaining. Ole Miss would end the first half with a surprising touchdown pass from Kelly to offensive lineman, [[Laremy Tunsil]] as time expired, putting Ole Miss up 34\u20136 at the half. The Rebels would open up scoring in the second when running back Jordan Wilkins ran it in from 36 yards out with roughly four and half minutes left in the third quarter, putting Ole Miss up 41\u20136. Oklahoma State scored its first touchdown of the game when quarterback [[J. W. Walsh]] ran it in from two yards out with 1:11 left in the quarter. Kelly, for a third time in the game, would find Treadwell. This time from 14 yards out with 13:04 left in the game. The Cowboys ended scoring in the game when J.W. Walsh ran it in from eight yards out with three minutes left, giving the Rebels the 48\u201320 victory.

The Rebels entered the season with a #17 ranking in the AP Poll and as 39.5 point favorites in their season opener. The Rebels dominated the Skyhawks in the opener from the very beginning, when running back Jaylen Walton scored Ole Miss's first points of the year on a 60-yd touchdown run only four minutes into the game. The Rebels only led 6\u20130, however, after a failed two point conversion. Walton would get his second touchdown of the game after he found the end zone four yards out which put the Rebels up 13\u20130 with 6:42 left in the first quarter. Ole Miss's first passing touchdown would occur when new Junior quarterback Chad Kelly would find Markell Pack for a 56-yd touchdown strike with 5:28 remaining, which put Ole Miss up 20\u20130 with one third of the first quarter left. The Rebels' final score of the first quarter would come when quarterback Ryan Buchanan would find wide receiver [[Quincy Adeboyejo]] for a 15-yd touchdown strike, putting the Rebels up 27\u20130 at the end of the first quarter. The second quarter would feature two more passing touchdowns by the Rebels, the first of which was a surprising 31-yd touchdown pass from Ryan Buchanan to defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche with 12:35 left in the half. Second one would come when Chad Kelly would find [[Cody Core]] for a 57-yd touchdown pass to put Rebels up 41\u20130 going into halftime. The first points of the second half would happen when defensive back Trae Elston would intercept the Skyhawks when they were in the red zone and he would return it 93 yards for another Ole Miss score with 9:09 left in the third quarter. The next points would come when Chad Kelly would run in it from 20 yards out to put the Rebels up 55\u20130 with 4:56 left in the third quarter. Tennessee\u2212Martin's first and only points of the game would come when kicker Jackson Redditt would make it 29 yards out. The Rebels led 55\u20133 heading into the fourth quarter. Quarterback Devante Kincade would score for the first time of the game when he found receiver DaMarkus Lodge 12 yards out to put Ole Miss up 62\u20133 only four and a half minutes into the fourth quarter. Ole Miss's last two touchdowns of the game would come on the ground, when Eugene Brazley would run in it from 70 yards out and D.K. Buford would find the end zone from 20 yards out.

The Rebels put up 28 points in the first quarter, which was the most points scored in a single quarter in Ole Miss history. Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly was responsible for all four of Ole Miss's touchdowns, the first one coming only three minutes into the game when Kelly found Cody Core in the end zone for a fourteen-yard touchdown strike. Kelly's next touchdown would come on the ground, when he would run it in from four yards out. The Rebels had a 14\u20130 with 8:26 remaining in the first quarter. Kelly's first of three touchdown passes to Quincy Adeboyejo would come from 16 yards out with 4:30 left, and the second one would soon follow when Kelly found him from 50 yards out. Ole Miss entered the second quarter with 28\u20130 lead. The first points of the second quarter would come when Ole Miss quarterback Ryan Buchanan would be intercepted by Shannon Edwards, and that interception would be returned for a touchdown to give the Bulldogs their first points. Kelly would come back in the game, and hit Adeboyejo once more for a 44-yard touchdown pass to put Ole Miss up 35\u20137 with 4:15 remaining in the half. The half's final points would be scored by the Bulldogs as time expired, when Fresno State quarterback Chason Virgil would find Josiah Blandin from nine yards out to pull to within 21 points at the break. Robert Nkemdiche would open the second half with an offensive score, after he ran the ball in from a yard out. The Ole Miss defense would score its first points when Trae Elston would intercept Virgil and return it for a 38-yard touchdown, to put Ole Miss up 49\u201314. Ole Miss would get its second rushing touchdown of the game when [[Akeem Judd]] ran it in from 27 yards out to put Ole Miss up 56\u201314. The Bulldogs, however, would score the quarter's final points when Virgil would find Marteze Waller from seven yards out to trim the lead to 56\u201321 heading into the final quarter of play. Ole Miss would get its only field of the game when kicker Gary Wunderlich would split the uprights to put the Rebels up 59\u201321, and it wouldn't be much longer before the Rebels scored once again, when running back Eugene Brazley would find the end zone from six yards out to put Ole Miss up 66\u201321. And it would the landshark defense of Ole Miss who would score the game's final points, when Ford Childress would intercept Virgil and return it 22 yards to win the game, 73\u201321. Ole Miss would become the first SEC team to ever score 70 points in back to back games.<ref>https://www.si.com/game/9963961/box-score</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===#2 [[2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]===\n{{See also|Alabama\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''#15 Ole Miss'''\n|R1= 3||R2= 14||R3= 13||R4= 13\n|Home=#2 Alabama\n|H1= 0||H2= 10||H3= 7||H4= 20\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

However, Ole Miss would be the team who never trailed in the entire game. On the opening kickoff, Alabama fumbled the ball which led to an early Ole Miss field goal only about thirty seconds in, but that would be the only score of the first quarter. The Tide knotted the game up at 3 when Adam Griffith hit a field from twenty yards out with 12:20 left in the second quarter. The Rebels would be responsible for the game's first two touchdowns, when Jordan Wilkins ran it in from one yard on fourth and goal with 7:30 remaining in the first half. Chad Kelly would run it in next, this time from four yards out to put Ole Miss up 17\u20133 with 6:43 left in the half. Alabama managed to put one touchdown on the board before the half, as Ole Miss led at the half, 17\u201310. The first points of the second half would come on an outrageous pass from Chad Kelly to Quincy Adeboyejo from 66 yards out, to put Ole Miss up 24\u201310 with 12:53 left in the third quarter. Ole Miss would then tack on two Gary Wunderlich field goals, one from 34 yards out and one from 45 yards out, which put the Rebels up 30\u201310 with four minutes left in the third quarter. The Tide would score the quarter's final points, when quarterback [[Jake Coker]] would run it in with 1:33 left. Alabama would pull to within six points when Coker would find [[ArDarius Stewart]] from eight yards out with 12:30 left in the game. Ole Miss's next big play would come when Chad Kelly would find a wide open Cody Core for a 73-yd touchdown strike less than a minute after Alabama pulled to within six. After a failed two point conversion, The Rebels led 36\u201324. Ole Miss would score again when Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from 24 yards out following an Alabama interception to put the Rebels up 43\u201324. The Tide would score with 6:36 left in the game when running back [[Derrick Henry]] would find the end zone from two yards out to bring the Tide to within 13. Alabama would also fail on a two-point conversion try, so the score remained 43\u201330. Alabama surprisingly recovered the onside kick that followed, and capitalized with a touchdown from Coker to [[Richard Mullaney]] with four and half minutes left. Ole Miss led 43\u201337. After the next Ole Miss drive stalled, Alabama got the ball back down by six points with three minutes left. Their game-winning drive, however, would be terminated by an interception from Coker. Alabama got one final chance with 31 seconds left at their own 30 yard line, but failed to get a first down. Ole Miss beat Alabama in back to back seasons for the first time ever and won in Tuscaloosa for the second time ever.  Following Ole Miss's upset win, the Rebels rose to #3 in the rankings, which was the first time since 1963\u201364 that Ole Miss was ranked in the top 3 in back to back seasons.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]]===\n{{See also|Vanderbilt\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Vanderbilt\n|R1= 3||R2= 0||R3= 10||R4= 3||RT= 16\n|Home='''#3 Ole Miss'''\n|H1= 7||H2= 6||H3= 7||H4= 7||HT= 27\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

However, the game itself was much closer than the experts, the team and the fans anticipated. Ole Miss came in with the highest offensive efficiency in country, but struggled to move the ball against a greatly improved Vanderbilt defense. Ole Miss QB Chad Kelly threw an interception on the Rebels' first drive of the game, and the team that had scored 192 points through the first three games had failed to put up any points at all through the first twelve minutes of the first quarter. The Commodores moved the ball well on their final drive of the first quarter, but settled for a field goal, as Vanderbilt went up 3\u20130 with 3:25 left in the opening quarter. This would become the first time all season that Ole Miss trailed in a game. However, the game's first touchdown would come from Chad Kelly to wide receiver [[Damore'ea Stringfellow]] with roughly two minutes left in the first quarter. Ole Miss would return to the red zone following a Vanderbilt punt, but because of a 10-yard holding penalty on third down, the Rebels were forced to settle for a field goal, as Gary Wunderlich scored his first points for Ole Miss of the night from 19 yards out with five and a half minutes left of the half. Vanderbilt would once again fail to consistently move the ball on their next possession, which resulted in another punt. On the ensuing drive, Ole Miss would be the team with red zone offensive difficulties, as the Rebels could not put the ball in the end zone, and settled for a field goal. That would be the final score of the half, and Ole Miss went to the locker room with a 13\u20133 lead. Vanderbilt opened the second half with one of their most productive drives of the game, with big passes from quarterback Johnny McCrary, as the Commodores managed a field goal from 41 yards out. Ole Miss would soon return to the red zone not much longer after, thanks to a moderately effective running game and some big plays through the air. However, the Rebels once again would fail to find the end zone, as they were forced to settle for what was seemingly a guaranteed 29 yard Gary Wunderlich field goal. However, what would've been another three points for the Rebels didn't happen due to a Nifae Lealao block on the kick. The score stalled at 13\u20136. Vanderbilt would produce another highly productive drive thanks to an efficient running game, this time resulting in a touchdown pass from Johnny McCrary to [[Ralph Webb (American football)|Ralph Webb]] from seven yards out with eight and half minutes left in the third quarter. With the score tied at 13\u201313, Ole Miss fans at the game were visibly starting to get restless as the 26.5 point underdog Vanderbilt Commodores were proving to be a worthy opponent. After Ole Miss punted on the following drive, Vanderbilt's next drive would also result in a punt. However, the Commodores' punt was blocked, which would lead to Ole Miss's second of three touchdowns in the game with 1:30 left in the third quarter. Ole Miss entered the final phase of the game with a narrow one touchdown lead. Despite many chances to force a Vanderbilt punt on third down, the Commodores managed to produce another effective drive and got deep into Ole Miss territory. Although they failed to tie the game at 20, the Commodores tightened the game by pulling to within four points with 12:25 left in the fourth quarter. After another Ole Miss drive stalled, the Commodores got the ball back and again, moved the ball very well. They once again reached the red zone, but couldn't get past the goal line. The settled for what should've been an easy field goal, but Tommy Openshaw, the Commodores' kicker, missed from 32 yards out. On Ole Miss's ensuing drive, they finally managed to move the ball much more productively than they had before. The Rebels found the end zone for a third and final time in the game, increasing their lead to 27\u201316 with about seven minutes left in the game. Vanderbilt's final drive, although they moved the ball decently, ended after failing to convert on fourth down. Ole Miss would get a small handful of first downs on the ensuing drive then kneel the rest of the game to seal the victory. Ole Miss improved to 4\u20130 on the year and 2\u20130 in conference play. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===#25 [[2015 Florida Gators football team|Florida]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=#3 Ole Miss\n|R1= 0||R2= 0||R3= 3||R4= 7||RT=\n|Home='''#25 Florida'''\n|H1= 13||H2= 12||H3= 0||H4= 13||HT=\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Ole Miss entered the game as 7.5 point favorites, but never had the lead at any point in the game. Florida opened the scoring with 9:09 remaining in the first quarter on 36 yard touchdown pass from [[Will Grier]] to [[Demarcus Robinson]], which would be the first passing play of 20+ yards that the Rebels have given up all year. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, it would only a take a small handful of plays by the Florida defense to force a Jaylen Walton fumble, which would lead to Florida's second touchdown of the game and the final points of the first quarter. The extra point was no good, however, so the score remained 13\u20130 heading into the second phase of the game. After failing to score once again, Florida would get the ball back and would yet again find the end zone on a deep pass from Will Grier (77 yards out) to [[Brandon Powell]] in a drive that lasted less than a minute. Florida would attempt the two point conversion to make up for the missed PAT, but failed on the try, so Florida led 19\u20130. The Rebels would once again fail to productively move the ball on offense, so Florida regained possession once again before the half, and managed another touchdown before heading into the locker room with 20 seconds left on a pass from Grier to [[Antonio Callaway]] from fifteen yards out. Florida, once again, would attempt and fail on the two point conversion, so the score was 25\u20130 at halftime. After multiple miscues, failed opportunities, (a missed 29 yard field goal among them) and red zone failures, The Rebels opened up the second half in an effort to correct those mistakes. The Ole Miss defense was successful in shutting out the Florida offense in the third quarter, but the Rebels' offense would only manage a field goal with 5:25 left in the third quarter. Florida opened up the fourth quarter with a pair of field goals of the own, from 31 and 22 yards out, respectively. Florida would find the end zone once again on a Jordan Cronkrite run from one yard out, to extend Florida's lead to 38\u20133. Ole Miss would score their first and only touchdown on a seven-yard Markell Pack pass from Chad Kelly with 4:04 left in the game, but it was too little too late. Ole Miss would lose their first game of the year in the Swamp by four touchdowns.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 New Mexico State Aggies football team|New Mexico State]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=New Mexico State\n|R1=3 ||R2=0 ||R3=0 ||R4=0 ||RT=3\n|Home='''#14 Ole Miss'''\n|H1=17 ||H2=14 ||H3=14 ||H4=7 ||HT=52\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Ole Miss received the ball first and moved the ball very well on their opening drive, but similar to what happened multiple times in the previous two games against Florida and Vanderbilt, failed to get in the end zone and settled for an early Gary Wunderlich field goal from 21 yards out with 11:25 left in the opening quarter. On the Aggies' ensuing possession, they were able to match Ole Miss's field goal with a Parker Davidson kick of their own, from 39 yards out with 4:24 left. With the score tied 3\u20133, Ole Miss got the ball back and found the end zone for a second time on a Jordan Wilkins touchdown run from eleven yards out with roughly three minutes remaining in the first quarter. Ole Miss would get the ball back again in the first quarter, and found the end zone once again on a three-yard Akeem Judd as time expired. The second quarter didn't see as much scoring, as the first points of the second quarter of play didn't come until there was slightly less than six minutes left in the half, when Chad Kelly would complete his first touchdown strike to Markell Pack from 66 yards out. The Rebels managed to increase their lead to 31\u20133 with under two minutes remaining in the half when Chad Kelly would get his first rushing touchdown of the game from four yards out, and the Rebels took their 31\u20133 lead to the locker room. After another slow start by the offenses in the third quarter, the Rebels got to the end zone after nine and half minutes expired Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from twenty yards out to put the Rebels up 38\u20133. It wouldn't be long before Ole Miss found the end zone once again, when Kelly would once again hook up with Treadwell from 37 yards out to increase their lead 45\u20133. The fourth quarter would only feature one score, which was by the Ole Miss offense when running back Eugene Brazley would run it in from 78 yards out. Ole Miss rebounded nicely from a very poor performance against Florida with a 52\u20133 victory against New Mexico State.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]]===\n{{See also|Memphis\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road= #13 Ole Miss\n|R1= 14||R2= 0||R3= 10||R4= 0\n|Home= '''Memphis'''\n|H1= 7||H2= 17||H3= 7||H4= 6\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

It didn't take long for Ole Miss's high powered offense to find the end zone, when wide receiver Laquon Treadwell threw it on a bootleg to Quincy Adeboyejo only twenty seconds into the game from 68 yards out to give the rebels the early 7\u20130 lead. After the ensuing Memphis drive stalled, Ole Miss received the ball again, and once again, the Rebels found the end zone thanks to their explosive offense. This time, quarterback Chad Kelly found Damore'ea Stringfellow from 23 yards out with 9:44 left in the first quarter to put the rebels up 14\u20130, in a game that was seemingly turning into a blowout. However, Memphis's quarterback [[Paxton Lynch]] demonstrated why he was regarded as one of the best quarterbacks in the country when he led the Tigers' offense on 65 yard drive that resulted in a touchdown on a one-yard pass from Lynch to Alan Cross with 2:12 left in the first quarter. After several drives stalled in the second quarter, Memphis managed to reach the red zone again, but settled for a 23-yard Jake Elliot field goal with 4:20 to go in the half, to pull the tigers to within four. Memphis soon regained possession following a Chad Kelly interception, and effectively moved the ball once again. Memphis found the end zone with 2:52 remaining in the half when Sam Craft ran it in from four yards out. On Ole Miss's next drive, Hugh Freeze boldly decided to go for it on their own 34 yard line, but was unsuccessful. This resulted in Memphis's final touchdown of the half when Paxton Lynch found Anthony Miller from six yards out to put the tigers up 24\u201314 heading into the locker room. Memphis received the ball to start the second half, and it didn't take much for Lynch to put up more points for Memphis when he found Mose Frazier from 31 yards out for another score to put Memphis up 31\u201314. Ole Miss, desperately needing a score, got the ball back and was finally able to move it the ball efficiently. Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from six yards out to pull the rebels to within ten. Ole Miss soon received the ball once again following a Memphis punt and, with 21 seconds remaining, managed a 24-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal to pull to within seven heading into the final quarter. The fourth quarter didn't see as much action, as both offenses were inconsistent. Memphis managed to field goal from 42 yards out to make go up two possessions again, and after another Ole Miss drive stalled, got the ball back and tacked on another three point, this time from 27 yards out with 58 seconds left in the game. Ole Miss lost to Memphis for the first time since 2004 and lost to an unranked non SEC opponent for the first time since 1979.

Ole Miss was six point favorites despite the loss against Memphis the week before. Texas A&M received the ball first, and despite a few first downs, the aggies were forced to punt. Ole Miss's first drive of the evening featured multiple big runs and big completions, but came up empty handed when kicker Gary Wunderlich missed a 44-yard field goal. After a quick three and out by the aggie offense, Ole Miss got the ball back and capitalized on a Chad Kelly touchdown pass to tight end Evan Engram from seven yards out with 2:33 remaining in the first quarter. Texas A&M once again failed to move the ball effectively resulting in another punt, so Ole Miss got the ball back once again. Despite moving the ball relatively well, the rebels settled for a 41-yard Wunderlich field goal and went up 10\u20130. On Texas A&M's ensuing possession, running back [[Tra Carson]] fumbled and the rebels recovered, giving Ole Miss good field position at the Texas A&M 33 yard line. This led to another Gary Wunderlich field goal, this time from 30 yards out, to put Ole Miss up 13\u20130. Each team's next drive stalled and Texas A&M received the ball again with four minutes left in the half, and managed a [[Taylor Bertolet]] field goal from 44 yards out to pull to within 16\u20133, which would be the halftime score. Each team's first two drives resulted in punts, which ran off the first five minutes of the half. Ole Miss got the ball with ten minutes left, and Chad Kelly completed a deep pass to receiver Laquon Treadwell from 58 yards out which resulted in a touchdown, putting Ole Miss up 23\u20133. The rest of the third quarter featured multiple punts by both teams and a Chad Kelly interception, but no scores. Texas A&M had the ball to open up the final quarter, but following one Kyle Allen completion for \u20132 yards and two other incompletions, the aggies were forced to punt. Ole Miss's opening drive of the fourth quarter nearly mirrored Texas A&M's, as it also resulted in a punt. On Texas A&M's next drive, despite moving the ball relatively well, failed to convert on fourth down, and Ole Miss got the ball back. The rebels' ensuing possession would end very quickly when Donovan Wilson would intercept Chad Kelly with 6:51 left in the game. Texas A&M, once again, failed to convert on fourth down, and Ole Miss was able to kneel the rest of the game, giving the rebels their second consecutive win and their first ever home win against the Aggies.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===[[2015 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]]===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''#19 Ole Miss'''\n|R1=3 ||R2=7 ||R3=10 ||R4=7 ||RT=27\n|Home=Auburn\n|H1=3 ||H2=7 ||H3=3 ||H4=6 ||HT=19\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The Rebels received the ball to open the game and despite making it to the red zone, the Rebels were forced to settle for a 27-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal to open up the scoring with a 3\u20130 lead. The next score would come from the Tigers who received the ball with very good field position, but failed to get a first down. The Tigers would still be able to attempt a field goal from 52 yards out despite not getting a first down thanks to where they started on the field. Kicker Daniel Carlson made it from 52 yards out, tying the game at with 3 with four minutes remaining in the first quarter. It wouldn't take much time in the second quarter for the Tigers to get their next score, as quarterback Sean White hit Ricardo Louis from 47 yards out for a score, which was White's first touchdown pass of the year. The Rebels were able to tie the game at 10, however, when running back Akeem Judd ran it in from 25 yards out with four minutes remaining in the first half. The Rebels went to the locker room tied 10\u201310 with the Tigers. Ole Miss received the ball to begin the second half, and offensive red zone struggles continued when the Rebels had to settle for a field from 37 yards out from Wunderlich, giving the Rebels a 13\u201310 lead. On Auburn's next possession, they would experience the same difficulties, when kicker Carlson would tie the game up at 13 with a 23-yard kick with just under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly would get his first touchdown pass of the day when he found Derrick Jones from 45 yards out to put Ole Miss up 20\u201313 with just under two minutes remaining in the third. A pair of Carlson field goals would soon follow, from 33 and 26 yards out respectively with twelve minutes left in the game. Kelly would find receiver Laquon Treadwell from 21 yards out to put Ole Miss up by eight with ten minutes remaining.

Arkansas received the ball first and quarterback Brandon Allen found receiver Drew Morgan from 31 yards out to give the Razorbacks the early 7\u20130 lead with 4:46 remaining in the first quarter. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, running back Jaylen Walton found the end zone from three yards out, tying the game at 7, which would be the quarter's last points. The next score would come near the midway point in the second quarter, when Allen would find Dominique Reed from fifteen yards out to put the Razorbacks back up by a touchdown. On Ole Miss's ensuing possession, quarterback Chad Kelly would run the ball in the end zone from eleven yards out to tie the game at fourteen. Arkansas kicker Cole Hedlund would get in on the action on the Razorbacks' ensuing possession, when he made his longest kick of the season from 45 yards out. The Rebels were able to do just enough on their final drive of the half when kicker Gary Wunderlich made a 37-yard field goal as time expired. Chad Kelly would get his first passing touchdown of the game when he would find receiver Damore'ea Stringfellow from 23 yards out with 13:09 left in the third quarter. The Razorbacks would respond receiver Jared Cornelius would catch a touchdown pass from Allen from 30 yards out to tie the game once again at 24. Kelly would lead another successful Rebels' drive and would end it himself when he ran it in from three yards out to put the Rebels up 31\u201324 with seven and a half minutes left. The Razorbacks would soon tie it up again, this time at 31 with running back Kody Walker would find the end zone from three yards out. Arkansas would regain the lead when Drew Morgan would catch a pass from Brandon Allen from ten yards out, to put Arkansas up 38\u201331 shortly after the fourth quarter began. Ole Miss receiver Laquon Treadwell would catch a pass from seventeen yards out to tie it at 38, and the Rebels would finally get a defensive stop which led to another Ole Miss touchdown, this time it would Kelly finding Quincy Adeboyejo from eighteen yards out with roughly five minutes remaining. Arkansas, however, would score the game-tying touchdown when Allen would find Reed from seventeen yards out with 53 seconds left, and the game went to overtime. Ole Miss received the ball to start, and Chad Kelly would find the end zone on an eight-yard run to put Ole Miss up 52\u201345. On Arkansas's ensuing possession, the Razorbacks were faced with a 4th and 25, and the game was seemingly over. However, following a lateral pass, running back Alex Collins found a hole in the Ole Miss defense and was able to convert. This was followed by an Arkansas touchdown and a successful two point conversion, which gave Arkansas the 53\u201352 OT win, stunning a sellout crowd in Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===LSU===\n{{See also|2015 LSU Tigers football team|Magnolia Bowl}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ole Miss Rebels|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=#15 LSU Tigers (7\u20132) at #22 Ole Miss Rebels (7\u20133)\n|date=November 21, 2015\n|time=2:30 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time|EST]]\n|road=[[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=10 |R4=0\n|home='''[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]'''\n|H1=3 |H2=21 |H3=14 |H4=0\n|stadium=[[Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium]], [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n|attendance=60,705\n|weather=Cloudy, {{convert|46|F|C}}\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV=[[SEC on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Verne Lundquist]], [[Gary Danielson]], and [[Tracy Wolfson]]\n|reference=[https://olemisssports.com/sports/football/stats/2015/-15-lsu/boxscore/3737 Box Score]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*MISS \u2013 Gary Wunderlich 32-yard field goal, 12:41.

The Rebels entered the Magnolia Bowl having lost ten of their last thirteen games against the Tigers, but won two of their last three home games in this series. The Rebels opened with a 32-yard field goal by Gary Wunderlich two minutes into the game, and following solid defensive play in the remainder of the first quarter the Rebels brought their 3-point lead into the second phase of the game, where running back Jaylen Walton ran it in from two yards out with 12:30 to go in the half. The next score would come from quarterback [[Chad Kelly]], who also would run it in, this time from six yards out. This put Ole Miss up 17\u20130. The Tigers once again failed to productively move the ball offensively, and when the Rebels got the ball back, they would once again score to take a commanding 17\u20130 lead. The Ole Miss defense would once again keep the Tigers from scoring, which ultimately led to yet another Ole Miss touchdown, putting the Rebels up 24\u20130. Brandon Harris, the LSU quarterback made one big play right before the half, finding Tyon Johnson from 39 yards out to pull to within 24\u20137 going into the locker room. LSU opened scoring in the second half only two minutes in, when kicker Trent Domingue hit a 43-yard field goal to pull the Tigers to within two touchdowns. The ensuing kickoff would be fumbled by Ole Miss return man Jaylen Walton, which set the Tigers up deep in Ole Miss territory. With roughly ten minutes remaining the quarter, LSU running back [[Leonard Fournette]] fumbled the ball on the way to a score, but William Clapp of LSU recovered the ball in the end zone to secure the touchdown, which put LSU down only by one touchdown. The Rebels would pull away once again, however, when quarterback Chad Kelly led a very productive drive which resulted in the quarterback running the ball in the end zone for a second time to put Ole Miss back up by two touchdowns, 31\u201317 with seven and a half minutes remaining. Ole Miss seemingly secured the victory when Kelly found tight end Evan Engram on a 3rd & 14 from 36 yards out for a score, putting Ole Miss up 38\u201317 at the end of the third quarter. The fourth quarter would feature no scoring, and Ole Miss went on to win by that score.\n\n===Mississippi State===\n{{See also|Egg Bowl|2015 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegeSecondaryStyle|Ole Miss Rebels|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=#18 Ole Miss Rebels (7\u20133) at #21 Mississippi State Bulldogs (8\u20132)\n|date=November 28, 2015\n|time=6:15 p.m. [[Central Standard Time|CST]]\n|road='''[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]'''\n|R1=21 |R2=7 |R3=3 |R4=7\n|home=[[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi St]]\n|H1=0 |H2=3 |H3=10 |H4=14\n|stadium=[[Davis Wade Stadium]], [[Starkville, Mississippi]]\n|attendance=62,265\n|weather=Clear, {{convert|68|F|C}}\n|referee=[[John McDaid]]\n|TV=[[ESPN2]]\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=[https://olemisssports.com/sports/football/stats/2015/-21-mississippi-state/boxscore/3738 Box Score]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*MISS \u2013 [[Chad Kelly]] 27-yard run (Gary Wunderlich kick), 11:09.

They were also looking to get their first win in Starkville since 2003, and hoping to beat the Bulldogs twice in a row for the first time since 2003\u201304. Following a fumble by Mississippi State quarterback [[Dak Prescott]], Ole Miss went up first when quarterback Chad Kelly ran the ball in from 27 yards out to go up 7\u20130. The Ole Miss defense kept the Bulldogs from scoring and provided its offense with another opportunity to score, which they did when Kelly found receiver [[Damore'ea Stringfellow]] from two yards out to go up 14\u20130. The defense of Ole Miss would put up its first points when defensive back Tony Bridges intercepted Prescott and ran it back for a touchdown to give the Rebels a commanding 21\u20130 lead. On the Bulldogs' first productive possession (which was also the first drive of the second quarter) they found the red zone but ultimately settled for a field goal to pull to within 18 points. On Ole Miss's next drive, Kelly once again found Stringfellow, with just under 11 minutes to go in the half from 36 yards out. Ole Miss would take their 28\u20133 lead into the locker room. Mississippi State found the end zone on the first drive of the second half on a one-yard Prescott run to cut the lead to 28\u201310, on kept an explosive Ole Miss offense out of the end zone the ensuing drive. Mississippi State found the red zone again, but had to settle for a field goal, cutting the lead to 28\u201313. The Rebels followed with a Gary Wunderlich 48 yard field goal to close out the third quarter, which gave the Rebels a 31\u201313 lead entering the final phase of the game, where they struck first when running back Jordan Wilkins ran it in from 39 yards out. Mississippi State responded when Prescott found Malik Dear from 13 yards out, and once again found Dear nearly eight minutes later to cut the lead to only 11 points. But, with less than two minutes left, it was too little too late, as Ole Miss secured a 38\u201327 victory, their first win in Starkville since 2003 and the first time they beat LSU and Mississippi State in the same season since 2008. This win catapulted Ole Miss 6 spots in the College Football Playoff rankings to #12, and ultimately got them a Sugar Bowl berth.\n\n===#16 [[2015 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]]===\n{{See also|2016 Sugar Bowl}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=#16 Oklahoma State\n|R1= 3||R2= 3||R3= 7||R4= 7||RT=\n|Home='''#12 Ole Miss'''\n|H1= 10||H2= 24||H3= 7||H4= 7||HT=\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The late season victories got them a second consecutive [[New Year's Six]] bowl berth, this time playing the [[2016 Sugar Bowl|Allstate Sugar Bowl]] for the first time since 1970 and with a #12 ranking in the College Football Playoff. The Rebels were seven and a half point favorites entering the game over #16 Oklahoma State. Ole Miss got the ball to start, and the Cowboys' defense intercepted Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly on the first Rebel possession, which led to a Ben Grogan 26\u2013yard field goal to put the Cowboys up 3\u20130 with roughly five minutes left in the first quarter. Ole Miss got the board with 2:20 remaining in the first quarter with a field goal of their own from kicker Gary Wunderlich, from 34 yards out. The Rebels would wrap up scoring in the first quarter when Kelly found a wide open Cody Core from 31 yards out to give Ole Miss the 10\u20133 lead at the end of the quarter. It wouldn't be much longer before the explosive Ole Miss offense found the end zone again, when Kelly found top receiver Laquon Treadwell from 34 yards out with 11 and a half minutes left in the half to put the Rebels up 17\u20133. Kelly would soon find Treadwell again, this time from 10 yards out with just under seven minutes remaining to put Ole Miss up 24\u20133. Kicker Gary Wunderlich would be the next scorer for the Rebels, making a 38 yards field goal with 3:44 left in the half. The Cowboys would score next with a field goal of their own, form 31 yards out with a minute and a half remaining. Ole Miss would end the first half with a surprising touchdown pass from Kelly to offensive lineman, [[Laremy Tunsil]] as time expired, putting Ole Miss up 34\u20136 at the half. The Rebels would open up scoring in the second when running back Jordan Wilkins ran it in from 36 yards out with roughly four and half minutes left in the third quarter, putting Ole Miss up 41\u20136. Oklahoma State scored its first touchdown of the game when quarterback [[J. W. Walsh]] ran it in from two yards out with 1:11 left in the quarter. Kelly, for a third time in the game, would find Treadwell. This time from 14 yards out with 13:04 left in the game. The Cowboys ended scoring in the game when J.W. Walsh ran it in from eight yards out with three minutes left, giving the Rebels the 48\u201320 victory.

Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the [[Robey Theatre Company]] with actor [[Ben Guillory]] in honor of the actor and concert singer [[Paul Robeson]] in Los Angeles in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nGlover has had a variety of film, stage, and television roles, and is best known for playing Los Angeles police Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] in the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' series of action films, starring alongside [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Joe Pesci]]. Later he once again starred with [[Gary Busey]] in the blockbuster ''[[Predator 2]]''. He also starred as the husband to [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s character Celie in the celebrated literary adaptation ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', and as Lieutenant James McFee in the film ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]''. In 1994 he made his directorial debut with the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] channel short film ''[[Override (film)|Override]]''.\n\nAlso in 1994, Glover and actor [[Ben Guillory]] founded the [[Robey Theatre Company]] in Los Angeles, focusing on theatre by and about [[Black people]]. During his career, he has made several cameos, appearing, for example, in the [[Michael Jackson]] video \"[[Liberian Girl]]\" of 1987. Glover earned top billing for the first time in ''[[Predator 2]]'', the sequel to the-[[science-fiction]] action film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''. That same year he starred in [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]]'s ''[[To Sleep with Anger]]'', for which he won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]].\n\nIn common with [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Elliott Gould]], and [[Robert Mitchum]], who have played [[Raymond Chandler]]'s private eye detective [[Philip Marlowe]], Glover played the role in the episode \"Red Wind\" of the Showtime network's 1995 series ''[[Fallen Angels (American TV series)|Fallen Angels]]''. In 1997, under his former production company banner Carrie Films, Glover executive produced numerous films of first time directors including Pamm Malveaux's ''[[neo-noir]]'' short film ''Final Act starring Joe Morton'', which aired on the [[Independent Film Channel]]. In addition, Glover has been a voice actor in many children's movies.

In an interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', Glover credited Jean Shelton for much of his development as an actor. Deciding that he wanted to be an actor, Glover resigned from his city administration job and soon began his career as a stage actor. Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the [[Robey Theatre Company]] with actor [[Ben Guillory]] in honor of the actor and concert singer [[Paul Robeson]] in Los Angeles in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nGlover has had a variety of film, stage, and television roles, and is best known for playing Los Angeles police Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] in the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' series of action films, starring alongside [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Joe Pesci]]. Later he once again starred with [[Gary Busey]] in the blockbuster ''[[Predator 2]]''. He also starred as the husband to [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s character Celie in the celebrated literary adaptation ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', and as Lieutenant James McFee in the film ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]''. In 1994 he made his directorial debut with the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] channel short film ''[[Override (film)|Override]]''.\n\nAlso in 1994, Glover and actor [[Ben Guillory]] founded the [[Robey Theatre Company]] in Los Angeles, focusing on theatre by and about [[Black people]]. During his career, he has made several cameos, appearing, for example, in the [[Michael Jackson]] video \"[[Liberian Girl]]\" of 1987. Glover earned top billing for the first time in ''[[Predator 2]]'', the sequel to the-[[science-fiction]] action film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''. That same year he starred in [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]]'s ''[[To Sleep with Anger]]'', for which he won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]].\n\nIn common with [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Elliott Gould]], and [[Robert Mitchum]], who have played [[Raymond Chandler]]'s private eye detective [[Philip Marlowe]], Glover played the role in the episode \"Red Wind\" of the Showtime network's 1995 series ''[[Fallen Angels (American TV series)|Fallen Angels]]''. In 1997, under his former production company banner Carrie Films, Glover executive produced numerous films of first time directors including Pamm Malveaux's ''[[neo-noir]]'' short film ''Final Act starring Joe Morton'', which aired on the [[Independent Film Channel]]. In addition, Glover has been a voice actor in many children's movies.

Tra Carson averaged a little more than 4 yards a carry (4.3) on 7 rushes for 30 yards and 3 touchdowns. Their performances helped the Aggies score on 8 of 12 possessions while compiling 680 yards of total offense over 37:28 minutes of possession. An important factor in the game was 3rd and 4th down efficiency. The Aggies converted 12 of 19 attempts on third down (63%) while going 2/2 on 4th down. The Gamecocks went only 2/9 on 3rd down (22%) and 0/1 on 4th down.\n\nTexas A&M received the ball to open the game, with Trey Williams returning the kick to the 32-yard line. After several plays, including a pair of swing passes to RB [[Brandon Williams (cornerback, born 1992)|Brandon Williams]], a third-down conversion pass to TE Cameron Clear, and a 22-yard pass to WR Ricky Seals-Jones, Texas A&M was set up on the South Carolina 1-yard line, where Aggie RB Tra Carson ran the ball in to give the Aggies the first TD of the game with 11:27 on the clock. The Gamecocks' ensuring drive gained just 15 yards (14 of which was penalty yardage) before ending in a punt to the Aggies. A&M found more offensive success on their drive, including 19-yard and 18-yard passes to Josh Reynolds and Sabian Holmes respectively. However, they could not convert a 3rd and 3 at South Carolina's 15 yard line, and settled for the 33-yard field goal by Josh Lambo, extending the Aggies' lead to 10-0. However, South Carolina soon answered the points, with a 3rd-and-4, 69-yard pass to WR Nick Jones for a TD, which cut A&M's lead to 3. The Aggies' following drive led to a punt, and the Gamecocks would gain 22 yards on their next drive before the end of the 1st quarter, with the score still 10-7 Texas A&M.\n\nSouth Carolina maintained possession to open the second quarter, but after a sack by LB A.J. Hilliard for \u22122 yards on third down, the Aggies got the ball back. Their possession had several explosive plays, including an 11-yard run by Trey Williams, a 21-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones, and a 15-yard pass to Edward Pope before being capped off by a 3-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones for the TD, making the score 17-7. The Gamecocks answered this score too, on a long 46-yard pass to Damiere Byrd for a touchdown, cutting the game to 17\u201314. Texas A&M\u2019s offense proved difficult to stop, however, and their next possession contained more big-yardage plays, including a 19-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones, a 16-yard pass to RB Tra Carson, and the 14-yard pass to Edward Pope for the touchdown. South Carolina could not answer that score, giving the ball back to A&M with 3:35 to go in the half. Spurred on by a 21-yard pass to senior WR Malcome Kennedy, the Aggies made a quick 2 minute, 19 second drive for another TD by Tra Carson, putting the game at 31-14. South Carolina\u2019s final drive of the half was highlighted by two big defensive plays from A&M. The first was a big hit from freshman safety Armani Watts to dislodge a touchdown pass on 2nd-and-10, followed directly by an 11-yard sack from freshman DE Myles Garrett. Facing a 4th-and-21, Carolina attempted and missed a 54-yard Field Goal.\n\nThe Gamecocks opened the second half with a 3-and-out, after which Texas A&M gained 66 yards on just 8 plays (highlighted by a 21-yard grab by freshman Speedy Noil), before a 5-yard catch from Josh Reynolds added A&M\u2019s 5th touchdown of the game, making it 38-14. On the first play of South Carolina\u2019s next drive, QB Dylan Thompson carried the ball for 6 yards, at which time Aggie redshirt sophomore LB A.J. Hilliard dislocated his ankle, forcing him out for the rest of the season. The Gamecocks would go on to score with a 5-yard TD toss to Pharoh Cooper, cutting into the A&M lead 38-21. With time running short, South Carolina attempted an onside kick, but it was A&M who recovered. Texas A&M\u2019s offense could not be stopped, and they added another touchdown behind Tra Carson on a 3-yard run, extending their lead to 45-21. The Gamecocks answered once again, with two 27-yard passes to Jerell Adams and Pharoh Cooper respectively, before adding a touchdown with a 10-yard pass to Nick Jones to make it 45-28. Texas A&M\u2019s ensuing possession ended in a punt (their first since the 1st quarter), but South Carolina could not capitalize, as their drive was cut short with and interception by Aggie safety Armani Watts.\n\nThe fourth quarter proved much less eventful than the previous three. The Aggies, after a 33-yard pass to Malcome Kennedy, scored to open the quarter, with a 2-yard run from Trey Williams. South Carolina gained 48 yards on their next drive, before failing to convert a 4th-and-10, turning the ball over to A&M with 10:05 left in the game. Possession never changed again, and the Aggies made it to the South Carolina 3 yard line before kneeling the ball to end the game.\n\n{{-}}\n----\n\n===Lamar===\n{{See also|Lamar Cardinals football|2014 Lamar Cardinals football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Tra Carson averaged a little more than 4 yards a carry (4.3) on 7 rushes for 30 yards and 3 touchdowns. Their performances helped the Aggies score on 8 of 12 possessions while compiling 680 yards of total offense over 37:28 minutes of possession. An important factor in the game was 3rd and 4th down efficiency. The Aggies converted 12 of 19 attempts on third down (63%) while going 2/2 on 4th down. The Gamecocks went only 2/9 on 3rd down (22%) and 0/1 on 4th down.\n\nTexas A&M received the ball to open the game, with Trey Williams returning the kick to the 32-yard line. After several plays, including a pair of swing passes to RB [[Brandon Williams (cornerback, born 1992)|Brandon Williams]], a third-down conversion pass to TE Cameron Clear, and a 22-yard pass to WR Ricky Seals-Jones, Texas A&M was set up on the South Carolina 1-yard line, where Aggie RB Tra Carson ran the ball in to give the Aggies the first TD of the game with 11:27 on the clock. The Gamecocks' ensuring drive gained just 15 yards (14 of which was penalty yardage) before ending in a punt to the Aggies. A&M found more offensive success on their drive, including 19-yard and 18-yard passes to Josh Reynolds and Sabian Holmes respectively. However, they could not convert a 3rd and 3 at South Carolina's 15 yard line, and settled for the 33-yard field goal by Josh Lambo, extending the Aggies' lead to 10-0. However, South Carolina soon answered the points, with a 3rd-and-4, 69-yard pass to WR Nick Jones for a TD, which cut A&M's lead to 3. The Aggies' following drive led to a punt, and the Gamecocks would gain 22 yards on their next drive before the end of the 1st quarter, with the score still 10-7 Texas A&M.\n\nSouth Carolina maintained possession to open the second quarter, but after a sack by LB A.J. Hilliard for \u22122 yards on third down, the Aggies got the ball back. Their possession had several explosive plays, including an 11-yard run by Trey Williams, a 21-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones, and a 15-yard pass to Edward Pope before being capped off by a 3-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones for the TD, making the score 17-7. The Gamecocks answered this score too, on a long 46-yard pass to Damiere Byrd for a touchdown, cutting the game to 17\u201314. Texas A&M\u2019s offense proved difficult to stop, however, and their next possession contained more big-yardage plays, including a 19-yard pass to Ricky Seals-Jones, a 16-yard pass to RB Tra Carson, and the 14-yard pass to Edward Pope for the touchdown. South Carolina could not answer that score, giving the ball back to A&M with 3:35 to go in the half. Spurred on by a 21-yard pass to senior WR Malcome Kennedy, the Aggies made a quick 2 minute, 19 second drive for another TD by Tra Carson, putting the game at 31-14. South Carolina\u2019s final drive of the half was highlighted by two big defensive plays from A&M. The first was a big hit from freshman safety Armani Watts to dislodge a touchdown pass on 2nd-and-10, followed directly by an 11-yard sack from freshman DE Myles Garrett. Facing a 4th-and-21, Carolina attempted and missed a 54-yard Field Goal.\n\nThe Gamecocks opened the second half with a 3-and-out, after which Texas A&M gained 66 yards on just 8 plays (highlighted by a 21-yard grab by freshman Speedy Noil), before a 5-yard catch from Josh Reynolds added A&M\u2019s 5th touchdown of the game, making it 38-14. On the first play of South Carolina\u2019s next drive, QB Dylan Thompson carried the ball for 6 yards, at which time Aggie redshirt sophomore LB A.J. Hilliard dislocated his ankle, forcing him out for the rest of the season. The Gamecocks would go on to score with a 5-yard TD toss to Pharoh Cooper, cutting into the A&M lead 38-21. With time running short, South Carolina attempted an onside kick, but it was A&M who recovered. Texas A&M\u2019s offense could not be stopped, and they added another touchdown behind Tra Carson on a 3-yard run, extending their lead to 45-21. The Gamecocks answered once again, with two 27-yard passes to Jerell Adams and Pharoh Cooper respectively, before adding a touchdown with a 10-yard pass to Nick Jones to make it 45-28. Texas A&M\u2019s ensuing possession ended in a punt (their first since the 1st quarter), but South Carolina could not capitalize, as their drive was cut short with and interception by Aggie safety Armani Watts.\n\nThe fourth quarter proved much less eventful than the previous three. The Aggies, after a 33-yard pass to Malcome Kennedy, scored to open the quarter, with a 2-yard run from Trey Williams. South Carolina gained 48 yards on their next drive, before failing to convert a 4th-and-10, turning the ball over to A&M with 10:05 left in the game. Possession never changed again, and the Aggies made it to the South Carolina 3 yard line before kneeling the ball to end the game.\n\n{{-}}\n----\n\n===Lamar===\n{{See also|Lamar Cardinals football|2014 Lamar Cardinals football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!
