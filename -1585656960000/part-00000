The RNRU also has had a number of international players within its representative squads in all forms of the game.

However, in 1902 the United Services Recreation Ground began to give financial support to the [[United Services Portsmouth Rugby Football Club]] to stimulate interest. The club quickly began performing strongly and gained an excellent reputation and equally strong fixture list. The appeal that had been sent out to all naval players to support Service clubs had worked and a definite movement had been made to induce all officers in the Navy to give up playing for civilian clubs.<ref>Francis Marshall, Leonard R.

The first of these matches took place in 1878 at the [[Kennington Oval]], but it was not until 1907 that the match became an annual fixture as part of the Inter-Service Competition. In 1919, an Inter-Service Championship was arranged by the [[Army Rugby Union]], which included Service teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as a [[Royal Air Force]] team and a British Army team playing under the name 'Mother Country'. The Mother Country and [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army]] reached the final at Twickenham, with New Zealand winning the encounter to lift the King's Cup. In 1920 the Army Navy competition was expanded to include the Royal Air Force.\n\nAside from the Army-Navy match and the Inter Service Championship the various Navy Representative teams (1st XV, U23, Women and Veterans) play in a number of competitions during the season in both the fifteen and seven aside games.

The first match was played in 2005 and since 2011 the Royal Navy Rugby Union have awarded caps for this fixture.\n\nThe Commonwealth Navies Rugby Cup is a triennial competition that was first played in 1997 where it was held in the UK.  Since then it has been played in Australia (twice), New Zealand and also South Africa.  The Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy have competed in every competition.  The Royal New Zealand Navy missed the 2018 competition.<ref name=\"navyrugby.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://navyrugby.co.uk/the-commonwealth-cup/|title=The Commonwealth Cup|date=25 March 2013|website=The History of Navy Rugby by Alligin Photography}}</ref>  The South African Navy competed in 2006.  The Royal Navy won the first 6 tournaments with the loss of only one match, to the Royal New Zealand Navy in the 2006 competition.  In 2014 the Royal New Zealand Navy were crowned champions on home soil following a 37\u201310 win over  the Royal Navy and a 26-5 win over their Australian counterparts.

The criteria is that the player must have played in six Inter Service matches since the 2008/09 season.  The first group of players to be win a cap Vic Percival, Sophie Roseman, Emma Swinton, Sarah Simms, Sarah Hinds and Pam Williams.  Pam Williams is currently the most capped RN(W) player with 3 caps.\n\nThe RN(W) players compete for the Roger Sherratt Trophy which is awarded to the member of the Royal Navy Women's Rugby Union Squad who is deemed to be the most valuable player of the season.  This player will have shown strong leadership qualities both on and off the field, have provided a positive influence on the Squad and have displayed the attitude and bearing that epitomises the values of the Royal Navy Women Rugby Union Team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alliginphotography.co.uk/navy-rugby-honours/|title=Alligin Photography - Rugby Honours|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Caps and Colours ==\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union first awarded caps for players of its Senior XV in their matches against the British Army.  When the Royal Air Force formed the Inter Services competition in 1920 the Royal Navy Rugby Union also awarded caps for these matches.  At the 2010 Annual General Meeting it was decided to award caps to the Senior XV's match against the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, and also for members of the Royal Navy Rugby Union's Women's team for their matches against the British Army and Royal Air Force.  The Women also have to meet an additional criteria of having played six matches in Inter Service competition since the 2008/09 season before they are awarded their first cap.\n\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union also award colours to members of their Referee Society on the first occasion that they either referee or are an assistant referee at a match involving the Senior XVs during the Inter Service competition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ashton Jones|first=Geraint|title=Caps and Colours|url=http://alliginphotography.co.uk/caps-and-colours/|publisher=Alligin Photography|accessdate=6 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013004336/http://alliginphotography.co.uk/caps-and-colours/|archivedate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Royal Navy Rugby Union}}\n* [http://www.navyrugbyunion.co.uk/ Official website]\n* [http://www.armynavymatch.org/ Army Navy Match] - Official site\n* [http://alliginphotography.co.uk/rugby/ Alligin Photography - largest collection of Navy Rugby Photographs and also some History of Navy Rugby] - Very unofficial site\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1B1UpsqN10 2010 Army v Navy Rugby Match] - YouTube\n\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n\n[[Category:Rugby union governing bodies in England]]\n[[Category:1906 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military sport in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1906]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rugby team\n  | teamname   = Royal Navy Rugby Union\n  | image      = Royal rugby ru logo.png\n  | imagesize   = 80px\n  | nickname   =  \n  | founded    = 1907 <br> (first known representative side in 1878)\n  | location = HMS Temeraire, Burnaby Road, Portsmouth, PO1 2HB\n  | countryflag = Flag of England.svg\n  | countryflagvar = rugby\n  | ground     =  \n  | capacity   =  \n  | chief executive =  \n  | coach = \n| president = Vice Admiral Ben Key CBE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://navyrugby.co.uk/presidents/|title=Presidents of the Royal Navy Rugby Union|date=25 March 2013|website=The History of Navy Rugby by Alligin Photography}}</ref>\n| captain = \n  | appearances = Dave Pascoe (35 Caps)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://navyrugby.co.uk/|title=The History of Navy Rugby by Alligin Photography|website=The History of Navy Rugby by Alligin Photography}}</ref> \n  | top scorer = \n  | most tries = \n  | league     = \n  | season     =\n  | position   = \n| pattern_la1 =\n| pattern_b1 = _whitearc\n| pattern_ra1 =\n|pattern_sh1 = _whitesides\n| pattern_so1 = _whitetop\n| leftarm1 = 000080\n| body1 = 000080\n| rightarm1 = 000080\n| shorts1 = 000080\n| socks1 = 000080\n| pattern_la2 =\n| pattern_b2 =\n| pattern_ra2 =\n| leftarm2 = \n| body2 = \n| rightarm2 = \n| shorts2 = \n| socks2 = \n  | url = https://www.navyrugbyunion.co.uk/\n}}\n\nThe '''Royal Navy Rugby Union''' ('''RNRU''') was formed in 1907 to administer the playing of [[rugby union]] in the [[Royal Navy]].

It was constructed from a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London, which closed in 1968. The Monsal Trail is about 8.5 miles in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction in Wye Dale, three miles East of [[Buxton]], and runs to Coombs Viaduct, one mile South-East of [[Bakewell]]. It follows the valley of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]]. The trail passes through [[Blackwell Mill]], [[Chee Dale]], [[Millers Dale]], [[Cressbrook]], [[Monsal Dale]], [[Great Longstone]], [[Hassop]] and [[Bakewell]]. The trail has numerous landmarks including Headstone Viaduct, Cressbrook Mill, Litton Mill and [[Hassop railway station]], and passes through six tunnels.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hassop station up empties approaching (remains of) geograph-2791559-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former railway line near Hassop Railway Station]]\nThe Monsall Trail follows a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1863 to link Manchester with London. The line was closed in 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport [[Barbara Castle]], not by the [[Beeching Axe]], and remained unused for twelve years before being taken over by the [[Peak District National Park]]. \n\nThe route through the Wye valley was necessitated by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]'s objection to the railway passing through his land (which included not only [[Chatsworth House]], but extensive grounds north of [[Rowsley]]). The route meant that the line had to pass above the town of Bakewell, rather than through it. The [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]], of [[Haddon Hall]], insisted on the construction of [[Haddon Tunnel]] to hide it from his view, but he used Bakewell railway station, which was built to a grander design than normal, and carried his coat of arms. The Duke of Devonshire later realised the value of the railway, and his offer for the Midland Railway to run through Chatsworth came too late. He was the force behind the construction of [[Hassop railway station]], which, although nearer to Bakewell than Hassop village, meant he did not have to share a railway station with his neighbour.<ref>''Railways in the Peak District'', by Nicholson & Barnes, Dalesman Books 1971</ref> Great Longstone (Longstone before 1913) served [[Thornbridge Hall]], and the railway station design, with leaded glass windows, reflected the architecture of the hall.\n\nFor many years the trail could not follow the trackbed through the tunnels at Monsal Head and Cressbrook which been closed for safety reasons and the trail was diverted to avoid them. The tunnels were walked by [[Julia Bradbury]] in BBC TV's ''Railway Walks: The Peak Express''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtp4b|title=BBC \u2013 BBC Four Programmes \u2013 Railway Walks, The Peak Express|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> Many access points and diversion paths were unsuitable for cyclists, wheelchairs or people with walking difficulties because of steep uneven stone steps or narrow paths.

It was constructed from a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London, which closed in 1968. The Monsal Trail is about 8.5 miles in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction in Wye Dale, three miles East of [[Buxton]], and runs to Coombs Viaduct, one mile South-East of [[Bakewell]]. It follows the valley of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]]. The trail passes through [[Blackwell Mill]], [[Millers Dale]], [[Cressbrook]], [[Monsal Dale]], [[Great Longstone]], [[Hassop]] and [[Bakewell]]. The trail has numerous landmarks including Headstone Viaduct, Cressbrook Mill, Litton Mill and [[Hassop railway station]], and passes through six tunnels.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hassop station up empties approaching (remains of) geograph-2791559-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former railway line near Hassop Railway Station]]\nThe Monsall Trail follows a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1863 to link Manchester with London. The line was closed in 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport [[Barbara Castle]], not by the [[Beeching Axe]], and remained unused for twelve years before being taken over by the [[Peak District National Park]]. \n\nThe route through the Wye valley was necessitated by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]'s objection to the railway passing through his land (which included not only [[Chatsworth House]], but extensive grounds north of [[Rowsley]]). The route meant that the line had to pass above the town of Bakewell, rather than through it. The [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]], of [[Haddon Hall]], insisted on the construction of [[Haddon Tunnel]] to hide it from his view, but he used Bakewell railway station, which was built to a grander design than normal, and carried his coat of arms. The Duke of Devonshire later realised the value of the railway, and his offer for the Midland Railway to run through Chatsworth came too late. He was the force behind the construction of [[Hassop railway station]], which, although nearer to Bakewell than Hassop village, meant he did not have to share a railway station with his neighbour.<ref>''Railways in the Peak District'', by Nicholson & Barnes, Dalesman Books 1971</ref> Great Longstone (Longstone before 1913) served [[Thornbridge Hall]], and the railway station design, with leaded glass windows, reflected the architecture of the hall.\n\nFor many years the trail could not follow the trackbed through the tunnels at Monsal Head and Cressbrook which been closed for safety reasons and the trail was diverted to avoid them. The tunnels were walked by [[Julia Bradbury]] in BBC TV's ''Railway Walks: The Peak Express''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtp4b|title=BBC \u2013 BBC Four Programmes \u2013 Railway Walks, The Peak Express|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> Many access points and diversion paths were unsuitable for cyclists, wheelchairs or people with walking difficulties because of steep uneven stone steps or narrow paths.

Narmad was its president.<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/>\n\nOn 23 March 1851, it was decided to broaden the society's focus, and to change its name to Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha. The first meeting was held that same day, and rules adopted. Pranlal Mathurdas was appointed its first president, with Mohanlal Ranchhoddas Jhaveri and Kishorlal respectively as secretary and treasurer.<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/> 70 members enrolled at the inaugural meeting, for a fee of [[Indian rupee|Rs]]. 2 per month. <!---The founder members were Pranlal Mathurdas, Mohanlal Ranchhoddas Jhaveri, [[Karsandas Mulji]], [[Dalpatram]], and Narmadashankar Dave '[[Narmad]]'.---> According to the Sabha's rules, membership was restricted only to the Hindu people. Others, however, were invited to take part in the discussion.<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/>\n\nOver the next 20 years, the Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha and its members played an important role in the social reform movements of Bombay city and other cities of Gujarat.<ref name=\"Ray1984\"/> The Sabha's status began to decline after 1876, with the gradual demise of its founders.<ref name=\"Ray1984\"/>\n\n==Publication==\nIn 1851, the  Buddhi Vardhak Sabha began publication of a monthly journal, ''Buddhi Vardhak Granth'', of which Narmad assumed the editorship.<ref name=\"Ray1984\"/> The first issue was published in 1851, the second and third issues appearing in 1953. Regular publication began from March 1856. Articles published dealt mainly with social issues.<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/>\n\n==Activities==\nThe main object of the Buddhi Vardhak Sabha was to awaken the social consciousness of Hindu people through debate, talks and writings. Prominent speakers were to be invited, and each meeting devoted to the discussion of a particular problem and consideration of how to solve it.\n\nIn May 1851, the Sabha's  members started the Bombay's first schools for Hindu girls, one in the [[Fort (Mumbai precinct)|Fort]] area, and another near [[Bhuleshwar]]. Members of the Sabha and the students of the [[Elphinstone College|Elphinstone Institute]] volunteered to teach in these girls' schools.<ref name=\"Ray1984\"/> The Sabha used to offer prizes for the best essays on different topics of social importance.<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/>\n\nThe activities of the Sabha were supported by the Gujarati wealthy people like [[Mangaldas Nathubhoy|Sheth Mangaldas Nathubhai]], Laxmidas Khimji, and [[Gokuldas Tejpal]], and by the [[Marathi people|Maharashtrian]] reformers like [[Dadoba Pandurang]], [[Atmaram Pandurang]], and [[Bhau Daji]].<ref name=\"Raval1983\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1851 in British India]]\n[[Category:1851 establishments in British India]]\n[[Category:Social history of India]]\n[[Category:History of Maharashtra]]\n", "name_user": "FiveFaintFootprints", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eActivities:ce - word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhi_Vardhak_Sabha"}

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the [[Majapahit Empire]] fell in 1520.<ref name=indianized/>{{rp|234,240}} Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy.

It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature\". Western tourists began to visit the island.<ref name=Friend>Friend, Theodore.

It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.<ref>{{cite web|author = Klemen, L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |title= The Capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'.

Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\n\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]].

South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]].

The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s.

Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] [[Bali Nusra Tangi|cloth and clothing]], [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\n\nThe [[Coffea arabica|Arabica coffee]] production region is the highland region of [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]] near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency.

Tourism further increased on Bali after the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\n\nThe [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of [[Legian]] and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), [[Ubud]] towards the centre of the island, to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]] and the newer developments of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].\n\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008.

Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\n\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe.

The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''.

The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with founding year in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=UC Santa Cruz News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=special-reports |url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists - News VietNamNet |publisher=English.vietnamnet.vn |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n* [[Marconi Prize]] (1975)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1110|title=2011 Marconi Society Symposium Comes to UC San Diego|website=ucsd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/nri-scientist-aj-paulraj-wins-tech-nobel-2014-marconi-prize/articleshow/29232251.cms|title=NRI scientist AJ Paulraj wins tech 'Nobel'- 2014 Marconi Prize|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=23 January 2014|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidanand}}</ref><ref name=turing/>\n\n====Computer science====\n* [[Turing Award]] (1966)<ref name=turing/><ref name=turing2007/><ref name=turing2014/>\n* [[IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzuAjubj90AC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=IEEE+John+von+Neumann+Medal+nobel+prize&source=bl&ots=rkYiZscjCW&sig=ACfU3U1JW9v2542rlwu9faU5zevkYsPqQw&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=IEEE%20John%20von%20Neumann%20Medal%20nobel%20prize&f=false|last1=Berntsen|first1=Drude|last2=Elgsaas|first2=Knut|last3=Hegna|first3=H\u00e5vard|editor-last=Tatnall|editor-first=Arthur|title=History of Computing: Learning from the Past|publisher=Springer |date=2010|pages=46|chapter=The Many Dimensions of Kristen Nygaard, Creator of Object-Oriented Programming and the Scandinavian School of System Development|isbn=978-3-642-15198-9|via=Google Books|chapterurl=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01059591/document|quote=it was in recognition of work that clearly was of Nobel laureate stature}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_isnt_there_a_Nobel_Prize_for_Computer_Scientists_Instead_of_the_one_for_economists|title=Why isn't there a Nobel Prize for Computer Scientists?|website=researchgate.net|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Computer Pioneer Award]] (1981)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/good-reasons/our-renowned-professors/|title=Our Renowned Professors|website=tum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/resources/policies-procedures-manual/section12|title=IEEE Computer Society Awards|website=computer.org|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Nevanlinna Prize|IMU Abacus Medal]] (1982)<sup>2</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/imu-abacus-medal/|author=Katie Steckles|date=23 May 2019|title=IMU Abacus Medal|website=spektrum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/who-was-nevanlinna-and-what-is-his-prize/|author=John Cook|date=22 September 2013|title=Who was Nevanlinna and what is his prize?|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yale.edu/2010/08/19/yale-computer-scientist-wins-prestigious-nevanlinna-prize|date=19 August 2010|title=Yale Computer Scientist Wins Prestigious Nevanlinna Prize|website=yale.edu}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The Computer Pioneer Award recognizes significant contributions to concepts and developments in the electronic computer field which have clearly advanced the state of the art in computing.
