This work was published under the title ''G\u00e9n\u00e9alogies''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1981, she was a member of the [[\u00c9cole Freudienne de Paris]], founded by psychoanalyst and philosopher [[Jacques Lacan]]. She was also a member of the editorial board of ''Action Po\u00e9tique'' (1969\u20131979). She has written for French national newspapers, ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'' (1986\u20131996), and then ''[[Le Monde]]'' since 1996.\n\nFor the past 30 years, she has been married to, Olivier B\u00e9tourn\u00e9, CEO of [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]].\n\n==Methodology==\n\n===Literary===\nIn the 1970s, Elisabeth Roudinesco's first works dealt with literary criticism, notably with [[Raymond Roussel]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]. At that time, her work concerned linking a singular trajectory and an author's work, without resorting to psycho-biography, in other words, the psychologization of literary work by the clinical study of its author. This approach allowed her to demonstrate that most of 20th century literature has been influenced by the history of [[Freudianism]] and psychological medicine based on the theory of degeneration.<ref>Roudinesco, ''L'inconscient et ses lettres'', Mame, 1979</ref>\n\n===History of psychoanalysis in France===\nFrom 1979, Elisabeth Roudinesco writes a history of psychoanalysis in France. At that time, the main model was still the biography, because the archives and documents of the psychoanalytical movement were still in the hand of [[Freud]]'s heirs.\n\nIndeed, this model corresponded to the historiographical trend centered on the notion of the founding father figure; a trend which is at the core of any quest of origins. However, this model has gradually declined.\n\nConsidering how [[psychoanalysis]] was established as a movement and system of thought, Elisabeth Roudinesco asserted that [[France]] was the only country where all the necessary conditions were gathered together, over a long period of time, to successfully establish Freudianism in scientific and cultural life. According to Elisabeth Roudinesco, this favorable situation dated back first to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 which provided a scientific and legal legitimacy to reason, heed/gaze over madness, giving birth to the institution of the asylum. Then, the [[Dreyfus affair]], which has precipitated the arrival of intellectuals' self-awareness as a class. Designating themselves as an 'avant-garde', they furnished fruitful and innovative ideas. Finally, the emergence of literary modernity with [[Baudelaire]], [[Rimbaud]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]], who enunciate, in a new style of writing, the project of changing man through \"I is another\".\n\n====Ellenberger====\nScholarly historiography emerged with such work as [[Henri Ellenberger]]'s ''The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry'', first published in 1970. Though this book had been known in English-speaking countries since that date, the book (published in French in 1974) remained largely unnoticed in France. Elisabeth Roudinesco republished it with a lengthy new preface in 1994.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\">Partially based on Roudinesco, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9alogies'', Paris, Fayard, 1994.</ref>\n\nIn his work, Ellenberger developed a conceptuality of freudianism founded on archivistics and reference to the concepts of \"mental tools\", \"long length\" and \"system of thought\". This last category proposed presenting doctrines in their own terms and structures. The study of the system of thought of [[dynamic psychiatry]], psychotherapies and psychological medicine no longer echoes back to a single founder, but to a plurality of singular itineraries, shattering the biographic model.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\"/>\n\nFrom Ellenberger's thesis, Elisabeth Roudinesco retained several guiding principles, while adding methodology derived from the works of the French epistemological school: [[Georges Canguilhem]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Thus, the study of system of thought becomes the form in which, at a given time, knowledge achieves independence, finding balance and entering into communication: a history of a man who thinks, systems which intertwine, but also a critical analysis of the concepts of consciousness and subject of knowledge.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\"/>\n\n===Lacan===\nIn 1993, Elisabeth Roudinesco published a biography of French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. From 1938, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] felt preoccupied by the generalized decline of the patriarchy and tried, like Freud and the English school, to promote the father figure within Western society, under the form of a symbolic function. Roudinesco highlighted the fact that the genius of Lacan's work is the introduction of elements from German philosophy (e.g., [[Nietzsche]], [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]]) within the Freudian doctrine \u2013 creating a phenomenon Freud would have never conceived himself, since he built his theory on a biological model ([[darwinism]]), by consciously refusing to consider and include any philosophical discourses, contemporary or ancient, in his thought process.\n\n====Critic====\nPhysician and philosopher [[Raymond Tallis]] wrote a scathing review of the first English language translation of Roudinesco's biography, stating \"The innocence with which Roudinesco reports all kinds of clinical cock-ups [in Lacan's medical career] makes this book a particularly disturbing read for a medic.\"<ref>Tallis, Raymond (1997) \"[http://www.psychiatrie-und-ethik.de/infc/en/Shrink_from_Hell.htm The Shrink from Hell]\". ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 October 1997, p. 20.</ref> On the opposite, John Forrester, former head of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University praised her work by saying that it is the most subtle and valuable work done on a national situation alongside with the work of Nathan Hale done on the American situation of psychoanalysis.\n\n===Th\u00e9roigne de Mericourt===\nFrom the study of the melancholic [[Th\u00e9roigne de Mericourt]] (1989), early feminist and famous case of the annals of French alienism \u2013 she has been 'gazed' by [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol|Jean-\u00c9tienne Esquirol]] in La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re \u2013 Roudinesco think the French Revolution is a paradigm in the French situation of Freudianism. For Roudinesco, it was necessary to include the analysis of patients into the analysis of doctrines as a major constituting element of the discourses of [[psychopathology]].\n\n===Freudianism and politic===\nRoudinesco think that invariant conditions are required to introduce Freudian ideas and establish psychoanalytical movement in a given space. First, a psychiatric knowledge must have been previously constituted, namely a gaze over madness able to conceptualize the notion of mental illness to the detriment of explanation such as divine possession. Secondly, the existence of a State of right capable of guaranteeing the free practice of a transmission like the transferential kind.\n\nWhenever one or both of theses elements are lacking it explains why the establishment of Freudianism has not been possible (era of the world influenced by [[Islam]] or whom the organization is still tribal) or its disappearance ( under totalitarian regime, nazism and communism). She notices that military dictatorship didn't refrain the expansion of psychoanalysis in South American (notably [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]). Roudinesco assesses that [[caudillo]] regimes didn't try to eradicate psychoanalysis as a \"jewish science\" as did [[Nazism]] in the years 1933\u20131944 nor as a \"bourgeois science\" as did [[communism]] over the period 1945\u20131989.<ref>Partially based on [https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2007-1-page-143.htm \u00ab Parcours de recherche:  \u00c9lisabeth Roudinesco \u00bb], [https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2007-1-page-147.htm  Entretien avec Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros et Franck Chaumon].

At that time, her work concerned linking a singular trajectory and an author's work, without resorting to psycho-biography, in other words, the psychologization of literary work by the clinical study of its author. This approach allowed her to demonstrate that most of 20th century literature has been influenced by the history of [[Freudianism]] and psychological medicine based on the theory of degeneration.<ref>Roudinesco, ''L'inconscient et ses lettres'', Mame, 1979</ref>\n\n===History of psychoanalysis in France===\nFrom 1979, Elisabeth Roudinesco writes a history of psychoanalysis in France. At that time, the main model was still the biography, because the archives and documents of the psychoanalytical movement were still in the hand of [[Freud]]'s heirs.\n\nIndeed, this model corresponded to the historiographical trend centered on the notion of the founding father figure; a trend which is at the core of any quest of origins. However, this model has gradually declined.\n\nConsidering how [[psychoanalysis]] was established as a movement and system of thought, Elisabeth Roudinesco asserted that [[France]] was the only country where all the necessary conditions were gathered together, over a long period of time, to successfully establish Freudianism in scientific and cultural life. According to Elisabeth Roudinesco, this favorable situation dated back first to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 which provided a scientific and legal legitimacy to reason, heed/gaze over madness, giving birth to the institution of the asylum. Then, the [[Dreyfus affair]], which has precipitated the arrival of intellectuals' self-awareness as a class. Designating themselves as an 'avant-garde', they furnished fruitful and innovative ideas. Finally, the emergence of literary modernity with [[Baudelaire]], [[Rimbaud]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]], who enunciate, in a new style of writing, the project of changing man through \"I is another\".\n\n====Ellenberger====\nScholarly historiography emerged with such work as [[Henri Ellenberger]]'s ''The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry'', first published in 1970. Though this book had been known in English-speaking countries since that date, the book (published in French in 1974) remained largely unnoticed in France. Elisabeth Roudinesco republished it with a lengthy new preface in 1994.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\">Partially based on Roudinesco, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9alogies'', Paris, Fayard, 1994.</ref>\n\nIn his work, Ellenberger developed a conceptuality of freudianism founded on archivistics and reference to the concepts of \"mental tools\", \"long length\" and \"system of thought\". This last category proposed presenting doctrines in their own terms and structures. The study of the system of thought of [[dynamic psychiatry]], psychotherapies and psychological medicine no longer echoes back to a single founder, but to a plurality of singular itineraries, shattering the biographic model.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\"/>\n\nFrom Ellenberger's thesis, Elisabeth Roudinesco retained several guiding principles, while adding methodology derived from the works of the French epistemological school: [[Georges Canguilhem]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Thus, the study of system of thought becomes the form in which, at a given time, knowledge achieves independence, finding balance and entering into communication: a history of a man who thinks, systems which intertwine, but also a critical analysis of the concepts of consciousness and subject of knowledge.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\"/>\n\n===Lacan===\nIn 1993, Elisabeth Roudinesco published a biography of French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. From 1938, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] felt preoccupied by the generalized decline of the patriarchy and tried, like Freud and the English school, to promote the father figure within Western society, under the form of a symbolic function. Roudinesco highlighted the fact that the genius of Lacan's work is the introduction of elements from German philosophy (e.g., [[Nietzsche]], [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]]) within the Freudian doctrine \u2013 creating a phenomenon Freud would have never conceived himself, since he built his theory on a biological model ([[darwinism]]), by consciously refusing to consider and include any philosophical discourses, contemporary or ancient, in his thought process.\n\n====Critic====\nPhysician and philosopher [[Raymond Tallis]] wrote a scathing review of the first English language translation of Roudinesco's biography, stating \"The innocence with which Roudinesco reports all kinds of clinical cock-ups [in Lacan's medical career] makes this book a particularly disturbing read for a medic.\"<ref>Tallis, Raymond (1997) \"[http://www.psychiatrie-und-ethik.de/infc/en/Shrink_from_Hell.htm The Shrink from Hell]\". ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 October 1997, p. 20.</ref> On the opposite, John Forrester, former head of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University praised her work by saying that it is the most subtle and valuable work done on a national situation alongside with the work of Nathan Hale done on the American situation of psychoanalysis.\n\n===Th\u00e9roigne de Mericourt===\nFrom the study of the melancholic [[Th\u00e9roigne de Mericourt]] (1989), early feminist and famous case of the annals of French alienism \u2013 she has been 'gazed' by [[Etienne Esquirol]] in La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re \u2013 Roudinesco think the French Revolution is a paradigm in the French situation of Freudianism. For Roudinesco, it was necessary to include the analysis of patients into the analysis of doctrines as a major constituting element of the discourses of [[psychopathology]].\n\n===Freudianism and politic===\nRoudinesco think that invariant conditions are required to introduce Freudian ideas and establish psychoanalytical movement in a given space. First, a psychiatric knowledge must have been previously constituted, namely a gaze over madness able to conceptualize the notion of mental illness to the detriment of explanation such as divine possession. Secondly, the existence of a State of right capable of guaranteeing the free practice of a transmission like the transferential kind.\n\nWhenever one or both of theses elements are lacking it explains why the establishment of Freudianism has not been possible (era of the world influenced by [[Islam]] or whom the organization is still tribal) or its disappearance ( under totalitarian regime, nazism and communism). She notices that military dictatorship didn't refrain the expansion of psychoanalysis in South American (notably [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]). Roudinesco assesses that [[caudillo]] regimes didn't try to eradicate psychoanalysis as a \"jewish science\" as did [[Nazism]] in the years 1933\u20131944 nor as a \"bourgeois science\" as did [[communism]] over the period 1945\u20131989.<ref>Partially based on [https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2007-1-page-143.htm \u00ab Parcours de recherche:  \u00c9lisabeth Roudinesco \u00bb], [https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2007-1-page-147.htm  Entretien avec Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros et Franck Chaumon].

She stands in debates such as laicity, cloning, genetics, innate and acquired. She fiercely criticized [[INSERM]]'s reports of experts over psychotherapies. In that sense, she is one of the very first signer of [[Pas de Z\u00e9ro de Conduite]]'s petition against systematic detection of delinquency of children under three years of age, as advocated by another [[INSERM]]'s reports.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nHer  book, a biography of [[Sigmund Freud]], has been awarded the [[Prix Decembre]] 2014 and then, the [[Prix des Prix]] 2014.

The members of the committee were: drg. Tan Tjiaw Yong, Gouw Loe Liong, drg. Tan Gie Djien, Tjoa Siok Tjoen, Lie Ping Lioe and Kwee Djien Kian. On 8 August 1961, the coordinators decided to establish Petra Christian University with its first department, Faculty of Letters.\n\nOn 22 September 1961, the 10th anniversary PPPK Petra, the establishment of Petra Christian University was made public. Several days later, on 28 September 1961, the coordinators of PPPK Petra formed the Directorate of University Affairs, whose duty was to manage the university and temporarily to act as Sponsor Board members. The members of the directorate were drg. Tan Tjiaw Yong, Ir. O.F. Patty, dr. Mesakh Wignjohoesodo, Gouw Loe Liong and J.A. Sereh. A year later, on 15 September 1962, the second faculty was established, the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Planning.\n\nRealizing the growth of the university, the coordinators re-evaluated the internal regulation of PPPK. On 18 July 1964, a committee for the establishment of Petra Christian University Foundation was set up with  the members of the committee, [[:id:Jacob Elfinus Sahetapy|Jacob Elfinus Sahetapy SH]], drg. Tan Tjiaw Yong, dr. M. Wignjohoesodo, Kho Hong Pie, R.M.S. Kertonadi and P.H. Saroinsong.

The name was changed in 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' \u2013 NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the [[Nazi Party]]). It was [[anti-Marxist]] and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], advocating extreme nationalism and [[Pan-Germanism]] as well as virulent [[anti-Semitism]]. Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] adopted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in that month, giving expanded authority. President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] had already appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act\u2014when used ruthlessly and with authority\u2014virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.\n\nHitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of its best speakers, he was made leader after he threatened to leave otherwise. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and the later release of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle'') expanded Hitler's audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer,{{efn|name=citizenship}} as well as in street battles and violence between the ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' and the Nazis' ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness, and cunning converted the party's non-[[majority]] but [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.\n\nOnce in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding their rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the ''Kampfzeit'' (the time of struggle) or the ''Kampfjahre'' (years of struggle).\n\n==Early steps (1918\u20131924)==\n[[Adolf Hitler]] became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=25}} Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power\u2014but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich [[Beerhall Putsch]]. He used the time to write ''Mein Kampf'', in which he argued that effeminate Jewish-Christian ethics were enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=27}} He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through legal means.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}\n\n===From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919)===\n[[File:February 1919 US News coverage of unrest in Germany.png|thumb|300px|alt=B&W newspapers|February 1919 United States News coverage of the unrest in Germany]]\nAfter being granted permission from [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]], 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German Army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914&nbsp;\u2013 November 1918), Germany was a principal nation involved in World War I {{efn|name=promotions}} on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the fighting on the front ended in November 1918,{{efn|name=surrender}} on 19 November, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital{{efn|name=wounded}} and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of [[People's State of Bavaria|socialist upheaval]].{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=73}} Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=75}} There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919.{{efn|name=guard duty}}\n\nHe returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time in Munich there were a number of assassinations, including socialist [[Kurt Eisner]]{{efn|name=KurtEisner}} who was shot dead by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival [[Erhard Auer]] was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahrei\u00df and the conservative MP [[:de:Heinrich Osel|Heinrich Osel]]. In this political chaos Berlin sent in the military \u2013 called the \"White Guards of Capitalism\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April.

The DAP had been formed by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Karl Harrer]] and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof.

Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as ''Political Phenomenon, Jews and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]''. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and [[Dietrich Eckart]] were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich, its organizational home.

This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution but accepted its social program. The League was led by [[Otto Ballerstedt]], an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \"my most dangerous opponent\". One Nazi, [[Hermann Esser]], climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler.{{sfn|Toland|1976|pp=112\u2013113}} The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Hitler and Esser were arrested and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, \"It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak\".{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=113}} Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month.\n\nOn 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]''.

In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Hitler led the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 8\u20139 November 1923. [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen Nazi Party members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed [[coup]].

Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at [[Landsberg Prison]].{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68\u201369}} Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=239}}\n\nHitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of [[Mein Kampf]] (''My Struggle''; originally entitled ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice''), principally to his deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{efn|name=Hess}} After the putsch the party was banned in [[Bavaria]], but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement]]. In the [[May 1924 German federal election]] the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.6% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the [[December 1924 German federal election|December 1924 federal election]], the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (combination of the ''Deutschv\u00f6lkische Freiheitspartei'' (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party. The [[Barmat Scandal]] was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter some reflection, Hitler had determined that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar. For five to six years, there would be no further prohibitions of the party.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Move towards power (1925\u20131930)==\nIn the [[1928 German federal election|May 1928 federal election]], the party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.1%), though in three areas the Nazis failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the Party gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the ''[[Zweites Buch]]''. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.\n\nAt the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, [[Erich Ludendorff]] represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) itself. In September [[Goebbels]] led his men into [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.\n\nThe [[1929 German referendum|German referendum of 1929]] was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.<ref>Nicholls, A.J.

It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]''.

Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. The [[Great Depression]] was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success.

The [[Catholic Centre Party]] maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \"through 1932-3&nbsp;... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \"forsook a true conservatism\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]]]]\n\nThe Centre Party's [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932.

Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \"playing second fiddle\" in the government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=233, 234}}\n\nIn his position of Reichstag president, G\u00f6ring asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of Nazi Party members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the ''Reichstrafgesetzbuch'' statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.\n\nThe law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa ([[Upper Silesia]]) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They served just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.\n\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 election]], but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.4%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.9%).\n\nThe [[Communist International]] described all moderate left-wing parties as \"[[social fascists]]\" and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the ''[[Industrielleneingabe]]'', a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).\n\nOn 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring, [[Minister Without Portfolio]] (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's ''[[:wikt:Machtergreifung|Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} though Hitler, and others, used the word ''{{lang|de|Macht\u00fcbernahme}}'' (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} and suggesting that the process was legal.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pages=569, 580ff}}{{sfn|Frei|1983}}\n\nPapen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet \u2013 still falsely believing that he could \"tame\" Hitler.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}} Initially, Papen did [[Marburg speech|speak out]] against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBoth within Germany and abroad, there were initially few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \"tame\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \"mediocre\" if not a bad copy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]; even SPD politician [[Kurt Schumacher]] trivialized Hitler as a \"Dekorationsst\u00fcck\" (\"piece of scenery/decoration\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\" and because of the German nation being proud of \"the freedom of speech and thought\". Theodor Wolff of ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' wrote:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht |title=Ruhig abwarten! |language=German |trans-title=Calmly wait! |work=Die Zeit Online |accessdate=2016-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|It is a hopeless misjudgement to think that one could force a dictatorial regime upon the German nation. [...] The diversity of the German people calls for democracy.|Theodor Wolff in ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', Jan 1933}}\n\nEven within the Jewish German community, in spite of Hitler not hiding his ardent antisemitism, the worries appear to have been limited. In a declaration of 30 January, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (''Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens'') wrote that \"as a matter of course\" the Jewish community faces the new government \"with the largest mistrust\", but at the same they were convinced that \"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\". The Jewish German newspaper ''{{Interlanguage link|J\u00fcdische Rundschau|de}}'' wrote on 31 Jan:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht |title=Ruhig abwarten! |language=German |trans-title=Calmly wait! |work=Die Zeit Online |accessdate=2016-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|... that also within the German nation still the forces are active that would turn against a barbarian anti-Jewish policy.|''{{Interlanguage link|J\u00fcdische Rundschau|de}}'', 31 January 1933}}\n\nHowever, a growing number of keen observers, like Sir [[Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet|Horace Rumbold]], British Ambassador in Berlin, began to revise their opinions. On 22 February 1933, he wrote, \"Hitler may be no statesman but he is an uncommonly clever and audacious demagogue and fully alive to every popular instinct,\" and he informed the Foreign Office that he had no doubt that the Nazis had \"come to stay.\"<ref>Kershaw, Ian, ''Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry and Britain's Road to War'', Penguin, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0241959213}}, 512 p.</ref> On receiving the dispatch [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], concluded that if Hitler eventually gained the upper hand, \"then another European war [was] within measurable distance.\"<ref>Liebmann, George, ''Diplomacy Between the Wars: Five Diplomats and the Shaping of the Modern World'', I.B.

The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. At the [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933 elections]], again no single party secured a majority. Hitler required the vote of the Centre Party and Conservatives in the Reichstag to obtain the powers he desired. He called on Reichstag members to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March 1933. Hitler was granted [[plenary powers]] \"temporarily\" by the passage of the Act.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147\u2013148}} The law gave him the freedom to act without parliamentary consent and even without constitutional limitations.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=7}}\n\nEmploying his characteristic mix of negotiation and intimidation, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: \"It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace\".{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147\u2013148}} The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non-interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against).{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138, 148}}\n\nThe Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the [[States of Germany|states]] and the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. Non-Nazi parties were formally outlawed on 14 July 1933, and the Reichstag abdicated its democratic responsibilities.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=200\u2013201}} Hindenburg remained commander-in-chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties.\n\nThe Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226\u2013227}} Journalists and diplomats wondered whether Hitler could appoint himself President, who might succeed him as Chancellor, and what the army would do. They did not know that the army supported Hitler after the Night of the Long Knives, or expect that he would combine the two positions of President and Chancellor into one office. Only Hitler, as head of state, could dismiss Hitler as head of the government. All soldiers took the [[Hitler Oath]] on the day of Hindenburg's death, swearing \"unconditional obedience\" to Hitler personally, not to the office or nation.<ref name=\"gunther1940_59\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n81/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | page=59}}</ref> A large majority approved of combining the two positions in the [[1934 German referendum]].<ref name=Kershaw_526>{{cite book |author=Ian Kershaw |title=Hitler, 1889\u20131936: Hubris |date=1998 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=9780140133639 |page=526}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early timeline of Nazism]]\n* [[Gleichschaltung]]\n* [[Poison Kitchen]]\n* [[Political views of Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n* [[Weimar political parties]]\n* [[Day of Potsdam]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = KurtEisner\n| As a socialist journalist, he organised the [[German Revolution|Socialist Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Wittelsbach]] monarchy in [[Bavaria]] in November 1918, which led to his being described as \"the symbol of the Bavarian revolution\".\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = citizenship\n| He could not, at this time, run for political office in Germany, as he was not then a German citizen. {{harvnb|Shirer|1960|pp=130\u2013131}}.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = promotions\n| Despite his receipt of several medals and decorations (including twice with the prestigious [[Iron Cross]], both First and Second Class), Hitler was promoted in rank only once, to corporal (''[[Gefreiter]]''). {{harvnb|Toland|1976|pp= 84\u201388}}.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = surrender\n| The Armistice, ceasing active hostilities, was signed and effective 11 November 1918.

The name was changed in 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' \u2013 NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the [[Nazi Party]]). It was [[anti-Marxist]] and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], advocating extreme nationalism and [[Pan-Germanism]] as well as virulent [[anti-Semitism]]. Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] adopted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in that month, giving expanded authority. President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] had already appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act\u2014when used ruthlessly and with authority\u2014virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.\n\nHitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of its best speakers, he was made leader after he threatened to leave otherwise. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and the later release of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle'') expanded Hitler's audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer,{{efn|name=citizenship}} as well as in street battles and violence between the ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' and the Nazis' ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness, and cunning converted the party's non-[[majority]] but [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.\n\nOnce in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding their rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the ''Kampfzeit'' (the time of struggle) or the ''Kampfjahre'' (years of struggle).\n\n==Early steps (1918\u20131924)==\n[[Adolf Hitler]] became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=25}} Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power\u2014but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich [[Beerhall Putsch]]. He used the time to write ''Mein Kampf'', in which he argued that effeminate Jewish-Christian ethics were enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=27}} He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through legal means.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}\n\n===From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919)===\n[[File:February 1919 US News coverage of unrest in Germany.png|thumb|300px|alt=B&W newspapers|February 1919 United States News coverage of the unrest in Germany]]\nAfter being granted permission from [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]], 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German Army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914&nbsp;\u2013 November 1918), Germany was a principal nation involved in World War I {{efn|name=promotions}} on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the fighting on the front ended in November 1918,{{efn|name=surrender}} on 19 November, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital{{efn|name=wounded}} and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of [[People's State of Bavaria|socialist upheaval]].{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=73}} Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=75}} There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919.{{efn|name=guard duty}}\n\nHe returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time in Munich there were a number of assassinations, including socialist [[Kurt Eisner]]{{efn|name=KurtEisner}} who was shot dead by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival [[Erhard Auer]] was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahrei\u00df and the conservative MP [[:de:Heinrich Osel|Heinrich Osel]]. In this political chaos Berlin sent in the military \u2013 called the \"White Guards of Capitalism\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=79}} The [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet \"radical rabble-rouser.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that \"had been infected with revolutionary fervor.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|p=37}} For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=34}}{{efn|name=political department}}\n\nIn June 1919, Hitler was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army's main priority was to \"carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} In May 1919 [[Karl Mayr]] became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May the head of the \"Education and Propaganda Department\" of the General Command von Oven and the Group Command No. 4 (Department Ib). In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr \"national thinking\" courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=72\u201374}} with Hitler attending from 10\u201319 July. During this time Hitler so impressed Mayr that he assigned him to an anti-bolshevik \"educational commando\" as 1 of 26 instructors in the summer of 1919.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=82}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=public speaking 1}}{{efn|name=public speaking 2}}\n\nIn July 1919 Hitler was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufkl\u00e4rungskommando'' (reconnaissance commando) of the ''Reichswehr'', both to influence other soldiers and to [[Espionage|infiltrate]] the German Workers' Party (DAP). The DAP had been formed by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Karl Harrer]] and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card for the German Workers' Party (DAP)]]\nDuring the 12 September 1919 meeting,{{efn|name=beer hall meeting}} Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against [[Gottfried Feder]], the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army \"education\" course.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=Feder}} The audience member (Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' disparagingly called him the \"professor\") asserted that [[Bavaria]] should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with [[Austria]] to form a new South German nation.{{efn|name=South German Nation}} The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=219}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a \"committee\" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the \"committee\" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party \"...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ...&nbsp;I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7\".{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=224}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}}\n\n===From early party membership to the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus Mel\u00e9e (November 1921)===\n{{quote box| quote = ''[[Otto Strasser]]'': What is the program of the NSDAP?<br />''Hitler'': The program is not the question.

With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 and his actions began to transform the party. He organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the ''Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=86}} There Hitler announced the party's 25-point program (''see'' [[National Socialist Program]]).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=85, 86}} He engineered the name change of the DAP to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''&nbsp;\u2013 [[NSDAP]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party), commonly known to the rest of the world as the [[Nazi Party]].{{efn|name=Nazi}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=629}} Hitler designed the party's banner of a [[swastika]] in a white circle on a red background. Hitler was later discharged from the army in March 1920 and began working full-time for the Nazi Party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=87\u201388, 93}}\n\nIn 1920, a small \"hall protection\" squad was organised around [[Emil Maurice]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}} The group was first named the \"Order troops\" (''Ordnertruppen''). Later in August 1921, Hitler redefined the group, which became known as the \"Gymnastic and Sports Division\" of the party (''Turn- und Sportabteilung'').{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=42}} By the autumn of 1921 the group was being called the ''Sturmabteilung'' (Storm Detachment) or SA, and in November 1921 the group was officially known by that name.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|pp=19, 20}}\n\nIn 1920, Hitler also began to lecture in Munich beer halls, particularly the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]'', ''[[Sterneckerbr\u00e4u]]'' and ''[[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]]''. Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as ''Political Phenomenon, Jews and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]''. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and [[Dietrich Eckart]] were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich, its organizational home. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100\u2013101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful: at a general membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}}\n\nOn 14 September 1921, Hitler and a substantial number of SA members and other Nazi Party adherents disrupted a meeting at the ''[[L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukeller]]'' of the Bavarian League. This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution but accepted its social program. The League was led by [[Otto Ballerstedt]], an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \"my most dangerous opponent\". One Nazi, [[Hermann Esser]], climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler.{{sfn|Toland|1976|pp=112\u2013113}} The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Hitler and Esser were arrested and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, \"It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak\".{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=113}} Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month.\n\nOn 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]''. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a mel\u00e9e in which a small company of SA defeated the opposition.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}}\n\n===From Beer Hall Mel\u00e9e to Beer Hall ''Coup D'\u00c9tat''===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00344, M\u00fcnchen, nach Hitler-Ludendorff Prozess.jpg|thumb|Defendants in the Beer Hall Putsch]]\nIn 1922 and early 1923, Hitler and the Nazi Party formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance. The first began as the ''Jungsturm Adolf Hitler'' and the ''[[Jugendbund]] der NSDAP''; they would later become the [[Hitler Youth]].{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=431}} The other was the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard), which in May 1923 was renamed the ''[[Sto\u00dftrupp-Hitler]]'' (Shock Troop-Hitler).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}} This early incarnation of a bodyguard unit for Hitler would later become the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26\u201329}}\nInspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]] in 1922, Hitler decided that a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' was the proper strategy to seize control of the country. In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Hitler led the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 8\u20139 November 1923. [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen Nazi Party members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed [[coup]]. Hitler was arrested on 11 November 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} Hitler was put on trial for [[high treason]], gaining great public attention.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=75}}\n\nThe rather spectacular trial began in February 1924. Hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the Weimar Republic on trial as traitors to the German people. Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at [[Landsberg Prison]].{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68\u201369}} Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=239}}\n\nHitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of [[Mein Kampf]] (''My Struggle''; originally entitled ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice''), principally to his deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{efn|name=Hess}} After the putsch the party was banned in [[Bavaria]], but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement]]. In the [[May 1924 German federal election]] the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.6% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the [[December 1924 German federal election|December 1924 federal election]], the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (combination of the ''Deutschv\u00f6lkische Freiheitspartei'' (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party. The [[Barmat Scandal]] was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter some reflection, Hitler had determined that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar. For five to six years, there would be no further prohibitions of the party.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Move towards power (1925\u20131930)==\nIn the [[1928 German federal election|May 1928 federal election]], the party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.1%), though in three areas the Nazis failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the Party gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the ''[[Zweites Buch]]''. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.\n\nAt the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, [[Erich Ludendorff]] represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) itself. In September [[Goebbels]] led his men into [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.\n\nThe [[1929 German referendum|German referendum of 1929]] was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.<ref>Nicholls, A.J.

London: Palgrave MacMillan. p. 138 {{ISBN|978-0312233518}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 14 January 1930, at around ten o'clock, [[Horst Wessel]] was fatally shot at point-blank range in the face by two members of the KPD in [[Friedrichshain]].{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=3}} The attack occurred after an argument with his landlady who was a member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert Hochter, who shot Wessel.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=118\u2013119}} Wessel had penned a song months before which would become a Nazi anthem as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''. Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=266\u2013268}} In May, Goebbels was convicted of \"libeling\" President Hindenburg and fined 800 marks. It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]''. In June, Goebbels was charged with high treason by the prosecutor in Leipzig based on statements Goebbels had made in 1927, but after a four-month investigation it came to naught.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-0289, M\u00fcnchen, Hitler bei Einweihung \"Braunes Haus\".jpg|thumb|right|275px|Hitler with Nazi Party members in December 1930]]\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,409,600 votes) in the [[1930 German federal election|September 1930 federal election]].{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany.

Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. [[The Great Depression]] was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at [[Potsdamer Platz]].{{sfn|Hakim|1995|p={{page needed|date=January 2014}} }}\n\n==Weimar parties fail to halt Nazis==\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded worldwide economic disaster.

The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The [[Catholic Centre Party]] maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \"through 1932-3&nbsp;... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \"forsook a true conservatism\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]]]]\n\nThe Centre Party's [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932.

Schleicher convinced Hindenburg to sack Papen, and Schleicher himself became Chancellor, promising to form a workable coalition.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=128}}\n\nThe aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, proposing a Nazi-Nationalist Coalition. Having nearly outmaneuvered Hitler, only to be trounced by Schleicher, Papen turned his attentions on defeating Schleicher, and concluded an agreement with Hitler.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=132}}\n\n==Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)==\nOn 10 March 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA increasing, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, [[Prussia]] re-enacted its ban on Brownshirts. Days after the ban, SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who sidestepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence.\n\nWhen Hitler's citizenship became a matter of public discussion in 1924 he had a public declaration printed on 16 October 1924,\n\n{{quote|The loss of my Austrian citizenship is not painful to me, as I never felt as an Austrian citizen but always as a German only. ...

The deaths mounted, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had suffered 47 deaths and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80 killed. Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the [[1932 German presidential election|presidential election]] which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on 10 April: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (53.0% 19,359,983) while the KPD candidate Th\u00e4lmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759).

After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by [[Franz von Papen]], Chancellor of Germany. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time.\n\nIn the [[July 1932 German federal election|federal election of July 1932]], the Nazis won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percent, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, with 230 out of 608 seats.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August.\n\nAs the Nazi Party was now the largest party in the Reichstag, it was entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect G\u00f6ring for the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}} Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \"playing second fiddle\" in the government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=233, 234}}\n\nIn his position of Reichstag president, G\u00f6ring asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of Nazi Party members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the ''Reichstrafgesetzbuch'' statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.\n\nThe law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa ([[Upper Silesia]]) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They served just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.\n\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 election]], but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.4%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.9%).\n\nThe [[Communist International]] described all moderate left-wing parties as \"[[social fascists]]\" and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the ''[[Industrielleneingabe]]'', a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).\n\nOn 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring, [[Minister Without Portfolio]] (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's ''[[:wikt:Machtergreifung|Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} though Hitler, and others, used the word ''{{lang|de|Macht\u00fcbernahme}}'' (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} and suggesting that the process was legal.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pages=569, 580ff}}{{sfn|Frei|1983}}\n\nPapen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet \u2013 still falsely believing that he could \"tame\" Hitler.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}} Initially, Papen did [[Marburg speech|speak out]] against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBoth within Germany and abroad, there were initially few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \"tame\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \"mediocre\" if not a bad copy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]; even SPD politician [[Kurt Schumacher]] trivialized Hitler as a \"Dekorationsst\u00fcck\" (\"piece of scenery/decoration\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\" and because of the German nation being proud of \"the freedom of speech and thought\". Theodor Wolff of ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' wrote:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht |title=Ruhig abwarten! |language=German |trans-title=Calmly wait! |work=Die Zeit Online |accessdate=2016-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|It is a hopeless misjudgement to think that one could force a dictatorial regime upon the German nation.

In a declaration of 30 January, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (''Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens'') wrote that \"as a matter of course\" the Jewish community faces the new government \"with the largest mistrust\", but at the same they were convinced that \"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\".

Although Imperial chronologies include eight empresses regnant in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref name=\"jt2007\"/>  Though [[Empress Genmei]] was followed on the throne by her daughter, [[Empress Gensh\u014d]],<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

On 20 January 2006, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the [[National Diet|Diet]] letting women ascend to the throne in order that the Imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner.

Although Imperial chronologies include eight empresses regnant in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref name=\"jt2007\"/>  Though [[Empress Genmei]] was followed on the throne by her daughter, [[Empress Gensh\u014d]],<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B.

Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round.

City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway.

An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

Fuk developed from a village into a sizable town from the 1960s onwards partly as an over-spill or [[commuter town]] for the city of Bristol. Although not a [[Planned community|new town]] in the official sense, Fuk took on many of the characteristics of one.\n\nAt the 2011 [[UK census|census]] the population was 21,603. The smaller town of [[Chipping Sodbury]] (population 5,045) is contiguous with Fuk to the east. In addition, a large southern section of the built-up area spills over into the parish of [[Dodington, Gloucestershire|Dodington]] (population 8,206), and so the total population of Fuk's urban area is now approaching 35,000.\n\nThe town is the birthplace of [[Harry Potter]] author [[J.K. Rowling]], who lived in Fuk between 1965 and 1969.\n\n==Schools==\nYate has two secondary schools, eight infant/junior schools and one special needs school.\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* Brimsham Green School\n* Yate Academy (formerly King Edmunds School)\n\n===Primary schools===\n* North Road School \n* Abbotswood School\n* Tyndale School\n* St Mary's School\n* St Paul's School\n* The Ridge\n* Wellesley School\n* Woodlands School\n*Rodford School\n\n===Special school===\n* Culverhill School\n* [https://www.sgse.org.uk/ South Gloucestershire Sports and Education]\n\n==Location==\nYate is located in [[South Gloucestershire]], which itself is in the [[South West of England]]. The town is to the north-east of Bristol city centre, which is about 11 miles away by road. A couple of miles to the south of Yate is the [[M4 motorway|M4]], which serves Yate from junctions 18 and 19. The [[South Wales Main Line]], a branch of the [[Great Western Main Line]] runs along the south of Yate. This line does not have a station in Yate. The [[Cross Country Route|Cross Country route]] from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] and the north runs through the west of Yate. [[Yate railway station]] is situated on this line. Apart from [[Chipping Sodbury]] to the east, Yate is surrounded by countryside and is situated to the south-west of [[the Cotswolds]]. The A432 is the main road to serve Yate and runs through the centre of the town.\n\nThe Yate-Chipping Sodbury conurbation is near the centre of the South Gloucestershire district. It is situated between suburban Bristol to the southwest and the Cotswold escarpment to the northeast.\n\n==Administration==\n\n=== National ===\nYate is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|the UK Parliament]] by the constituency of [[Thornbury and Yate (UK Parliament constituency)|Thornbury and Yate]].\n[[File:Aerial of Yate, South Gloucestershire, England 24May17 arp.jpg|thumb|Central Yate from an aircraft (2017), including the Sports Centre, shopping centre, [[Yate Academy]] and the Parish Church]]\n\n===County===\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Gloucestershire]] until 1974 it then became part of the district of [[Northavon]] within the newly formed [[county of Avon]]. In 1996, Avon was abolished, and the area became part of the unitary authority of [[South Gloucestershire]] and rejoined the [[ceremonial county]] of Gloucestershire.\n\n===Local===\nYate Town Council provides local services, which are displayed on their website.<ref>[http://www.yatetowncouncil.gov.uk/ Yate Town Council official website]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yate coat of arms.jpg|left|thumb|Coat of arms of Yate]]\nThe first mention of Yate is the existence of a religious house in about AD 770; Yate is also mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086. The name is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''giete'' or ''gete'', meaning 'a gateway into a forest area'.<ref>[http://www.englishtowns.net/yate/ English Towns Website]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] and well into [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], most of this part of south Gloucestershire was covered with forest. Through the centuries the land was cleared for farming.\n\nThe town's parish church, St Mary's,<ref>[http://www.acny.org.uk/venue.php?V=11803 St Mary, Yate] Diocese of Bristol</ref>\ndates from Norman times. It was altered during the 15th century and was extensively restored in 1970. St Mary's Primary School,<ref>[http://www.stmarysyate.co.uk/ St.Marys School, Yate official website]</ref> situated outside the churchyard walls, was built on the site of a former [[poorhouse]].\n\nIt was the opening of the railway station in 1844, as part of [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]], that established Yate, with Station Road becoming the central thoroughfare. The cattle and produce markets were held around this road, and businesses were established there. [[Yate railway station]] was closed by the [[Beeching cuts]] in January 1965, but was reopened in May 1989; the [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]]-built engine shed is preserved nearby.\n\nIn the 1960s Yate was designated as a development area and the building boom began. The creation of a new town included a large retail shopping area, sports and leisure development together with public buildings.\n\nWhen a secondary school was built in the late 1970s, it was supposed to be called Brinsham Green School, after Brinsham Lane at nearby Yate Rocks. Owing to a spelling error, however, it was in fact called [[Brimsham Green School]].\n\nThe town further expanded in the 1990s and 2000s with the construction of housing at North Yate. This housing estate continued to use the corrupted name of Brimsham. To locals the area is known as Brimsham Park.\n\n===Yate railway yard===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], a railway transfer yard was constructed for the [[United States Army]], probably as part of [[Operation Bolero]] to assist the buildup of troops and stores before [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. Two large storage sheds survived on the site until 2008.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the site was taken over by the [[Royal Navy]] and became known as the Sea Transport Stores Depot. It was occupied by the [[Highways Agency]] until the sheds were demolished for development. <br> [[Oxford Archaeology]]<ref>[http://www.oau-oxford.com/ Oxford Archaeology] Official Website</ref> has been commissioned to undertake an investigation as to the military significance of this site. The opinion of Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society has also been sought.<ref>[http://www.b-i-a-s.org.uk Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society (BIAS) official website]</ref>\n\nBanksy is believed to be Robin Gunningham, born on 28 July 1973 in Yate, 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from Bristol.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railway===\n{{Main|Yate railway station}}\nYate railway station serves the town. The railway station is located on the main [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] line between [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] and [[Cam & Dursley railway station|Cam & Dursley]], and is operated by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]].\n\n===Buses===\nBus services within the Yate area are mainly provided by [[First West of England]]. Other operators who provide bus services to/from Yate include Andybus, Severnside Transport and [[South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach]]. \n \nRegular bus services link Yate with Bristol city centre. There are also buses from Yate running to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cribbs Causeway]], [[Malmesbury]], [[Tetbury]] and [[Westonbirt Arboretum]]. Additionally, buses link Yate to a number of other towns/villages within South Gloucestershire including Badminton, [[Charfield]], Chipping Sodbury, [[Downend, South Gloucestershire|Downend]], [[Emersons Green]], [[Filton]], Fishponds, [[Frenchay]], [[Iron Acton]], Kingswood, [[Pucklechurch]], [[Mangotsfield]], [[Old Sodbury]], Staple Hill, Thornbury, [[Tormarton]], [[Westerleigh]], Wick, Winterbourne and [[Wotton-under-Edge]]. \n<!--WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A TIMETABLE. THIS INFO WILL RAPIDLY GO OUT OF DATE AND WHO WILL KEEP IT ACCURATE? SO COMMENTED OUT.....The majority of bus routes in the area operate Monday to Saturday only. On Sundays and bank holidays, the only bus routes serving Yate are the services to Bristol and Cribbs Causeway which operate to a reduced frequency with the first journeys being later and the final journeys being earlier than the rest of the week.-->\n\nBuses in Yate pick up and set down at Yate Bus Station which is at Yate Shopping Centre. A number of bus services also pass Yate railway station.\n\n==Design==\nMajor growth in Yate started in the early 1920s with the construction of the Moorlands Road estates behind Station Road, close to the [[Parnall]] aeroplane factory. In the 1950s the Ridge housing estate was developed. The area between these estates was still being mined for [[celestine (mineral)|celestine]] and therefore could not be built on until the mineral had been extracted.\n\nIn the 1960s the area around Stanshawes was exhausted of celestine and the housing boom started with the major construction taking place in the south. Much of this development was planned using the [[Radburn model]], a design that created a vehicle-free environment by the use of green spaces and linking paths at the front of the houses. This model was used until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the planners reverted to traditional street design methods for the development of the remainder of North Yate, Brinsham Park and the Newmans factory site.\n\n==Twin town==\nYate is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Bad Salzdetfurth]] in Germany .<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southglos.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/|title=Town twinning|date=2018-12-12|website=South Gloucestershire Council|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nBefore the Second World War, Yate had an aircraft manufacturing industry ([[Parnall]]) with a grass aerodrome.<ref>[http://www.chew76.fsnet.co.uk/parnall/parnall.html History of Parnall Aircraft].</ref> During the Second World War, Parnall specialised in making [[gun turret]]s. A number of people were killed in raids by the [[Luftwaffe]] on the factory in February and March 1941.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/97/a3604097.shtml The Bombing of Parnall's Aircraft Factory of Yate] BBC WW2 People's War</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, the Parnall factory turned to the manufacture of domestic goods and was famous for its washing machines. In 1958 Parnall merged with Radiation Ltd to become known as Jackson, producing the Jackson range of cookers. Through mergers and acquisitions, Jacksons is now part of [[Indesit]] and the Jackson name is no longer used.\n\nNewman's of Bristol had a large factory on Station Road, from 1932 until the 1980s, in its heyday in the 1960s, employing over 1,500 people.\n\nYate has had three natural products associated with it: [[limestone]] to the east, celestine or spar near the centre of the town and [[coal]] to the west.\n\nThe need for limestone increased with the growth of roads, while the demand for coal grew with the diminishing supply of timber. Celestine, the major [[strontium]] mineral, was first dug in the late 1880s and was initially used for the refining of [[sugar beet]]. At one time Yate's celestine accounted for 95 per cent of the world's production.<ref>Ian S. Bishop, Around Yate and the Sodburys (Nottingham: Adlard Print and Reprographics Ltd, 2010), 1.</ref> It colours flames red, and so was important for pyrotechnics such as fireworks, military and signal flares and tracer bullets. The last commercial excavation of celestine from the Yate area was for use during the [[Vietnam War]]. The mining company, Bristol Mineral and Land Co, closed in 1994.\n\n==Shopping==\n[[File:Yate.shopping.centre.arp.jpg|thumb|Yate shopping centre has over 100 shops]]\nConstruction of a pedestrianised shopping centre of around a hundred shops began in the early-to-mid-1960s.<ref>[http://www.yateshoppingcentre.co.uk/ Yate Shopping centre]</ref> The shopping centre was opened by [[Patricia Phoenix]], (who played [[Elsie Tanner]] in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Coronation Street]]''), [[Mary Rand]] (athlete) and [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]] (comedian). As with the most British net towns, modern art was included in the design: in the case of Yate, this was in the form of the Four Seasons sculpture, and a graceful and dramatic spire-shaped sculpture, which could be seen for miles, mounted high above the centre on the roof of one of the shops. This sculpture existed until the early 1990s when it was removed during the revamping of the centre, which included the erection of glass roofs over the walkways. An extension to East Walk was constructed at the start of the 1980s, and this included the construction of a new Tesco store, with the old store in South Walk turned into a Tesco Home and Wear store. An extension to West Walk was constructed in the early 1990s.\n\nYate shopping centre housed a single screen cinema until the early 1980s. It was closed and replaced with Spirals nightclub. The club closed in the 2000s and was replaced with Rileys pool club and then by Waves, another club. Waves closed in 2012. A youth centre called Armadillo opened in 2011.\n\nShops in the centre include [[Tesco]], [[Boots Group|Boots]] [[Dispensing chemist|chemist]], [[Halfords]] Metro, [[Iceland (supermarket)]], Argos, [[Superdrug]] and the Entertainer. Eating places in the centre include [[McDonald's]], Boswells and Wetherspoons.\n\nDuring the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, the shopping centre hosted Yate's annual festival. On opening day a celebrity launched the festival by releasing balloons and stayed to sign autographs. Celebrities have included Carole Lee Scott, in character as [[Grotbags]] (from [[Rod Hull]] and [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]'s enemy), [[Timmy Mallett]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Ross Kemp]] (''[[EastEnders]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]), Ken Morley (''[[Coronation Street]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Reg Holdsworth), [[David Neilson]] (''Coronation Street''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Roy Cropper]]), [[Beverley Callard]] (''Coronation Street''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Liz McDonald]]), [[Bob Carolgees]] and Spit the Dog, and the [[Milky Bar Kid]]. The festival also brought along a number of news presenters from [[HTV West]] including Bruce Hockin, Richard Wyatt and [[Peter Rowell]].\n\nOn 19 November 2009, a large crowd packed into the shopping centre to see [[Peter Andre]] switch on the town's Christmas lights and sing his single \"Unconditional\".\n\nOn 15 November 2012, [[Steps (group)|Steps]] plus a finalist (still to be announced) from the 2012 series of the [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]] were due to switch on the town centre's Christmas lights.\n\nIn December 2006, the owners of the shopping centre (Dominion Corporate Trustees) announced plans to enlarge and modernise it. In Phase 1 one of the main changes has been the replacement of the existing small Tesco with a large Tesco Extra. To replace lost shopping centre parking following the enlargement, the store is on stilts, with parking beneath. It opened on 24 October 2011.\n\nLocated near the shopping centre are [[Lidl]], [[Morrisons]] and [[B&Q]]. There are two [[Tesco Express]] stores in Yate: one on Station Road and one in Brimsham Park. The B&Q was built in the mid-to-late 1980s, along with two small housing estates, on the site of the Newman's electric motor factory which had been demolished in the mid-1980s. There is also a [[Screwfix]] branch located on one of the trading estates.\n\nThe shopping centre also has a [[Jobcentre Plus]], [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], library, leisure centre, over-50s caf\u00e9 and a health centre.\n\nIn 2008, construction of a new health centre began on the site of the old one, costing around \u00a312&nbsp;million. The new West Gate Health Centre (formerly the West Walk Health Centre) was officially opened on 8 March 2010.\n\nIn August 2009, plans were agreed for [[Tesco]] to pull down their store and replace it with a more modern store, known as a [[Tesco Extra]]. The plans include four more shop units, moving the bus station and a revamped entrance to East Walk. The revamp of the town's bus station was officially opened in January 2010. A temporary Tesco store was opened on 28 February 2011 while the new Tesco Extra was under construction. The old [[Tesco]] closed its doors on 27 February 2011 and the [[Tesco Extra]] store opened on 24 October 2011.\n\nIt was revealed in September 2011 that Marks and Spencer have asked for planning permission for a new store in two of the four new units, on which building work will commence in October 2012. The other two units will be occupied by [[Costa Coffee]] and [[Sports Direct]]. This second phase of the centre's expansion plans is being built next to [[Superdrug]], in East Walk (opposite the Tesco Extra store). The public toilets next to the Superdrug store will be demolished and re-built on West Walk.\n\nJ. D. Wetherspoons public house and restaurant opened in the summer of 2012, on the corner of South Walk/South Parade, occupying several units, including the former Motorworld store.\n\nIn September 2014, it was finally announced that Yate would get a new cinema. The cinema would be operated by Cineworld and would be part of a further expansion to the Yate Shopping Centre, which was also to include seven restaurants. The extension was built on and behind the current overflow carpark on Link Road, on the other side from the Tesco Extra store, and was called 'Yate Riverside'. Construction began in early 2015 and the cinema opened in spring 2016.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Yate.kingsgate.park.arp.jpg|thumb|Kingsgate Park]]\nThe town has a skatepark at Peghill. Yate Common on Westerleigh Road is used for dog walking, nature watching, kite flying, circuses and fairs.\n\nThe common has a stretch of unused [[dual carriageway]] ({{Coord|51.532282|-2.433879}}), known as the \"road to nowhere\", which has been used for filming in TV programmes such as ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.<ref>[http://www.southglos.gov.uk/NR/exeres/091ef4b1-5f57-4045-b02a-88976d918fb3 South Gloucestershire council hires out many venues for filming / training purposes]</ref> This was part a scheme to create a bypass from Rodford Way in South Yate to Nibley.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The scheme was only partially completed in 1974, the year when Yate became a part of Avon. Completion of the road would have entailed building a bridge over the railway, but finance for this was never made available.\n\nThe town has several parks and areas of open space. The largest of these is Kingsgate Park, which has an adventure playground for children.\n\nThe town is served by a community radio station, [[GLOSS FM]] which broadcasts 365 days a year on its webcasts and twice a year on 87.7&nbsp;MHz FM.\n\nA Cineworld cinema opened in the new riverside shopping centre in April 2016.\n\nThe town benefits from a four appliance firestation, with a retained Crew 24 hours and the further tenders manned on a voluntary basis.\nNext to the firestation is a 6 bay ambulance station with a further 3 ambulances and 2 response cars stabled outside.\n\n==Plans==\nYate and Chipping Sodbury have been earmarked for 5,000 new homes to be built by 2026. While the location of the housing has yet to be decided, the expected areas are to the north of Yate, and towards Chipping Sodbury.\n\n==Local sport==\n\n===Athletics===\nYate and District Athletic Club<ref>[http://www.yateac.co.uk/ Yate and District Athletic Club official website]</ref> is a track-and-field club based at Yate Outdoor Sports Centre.

Yate developed from a village into a sizable town from the 1960s onwards partly as an over-spill or [[commuter town]] for the city of Bristol. Although not a [[Planned community|new town]] in the official sense, Yate took on many of the characteristics of one.\n\nAt the 2011 [[UK census|census]] the population was 21,603. The smaller town of [[Chipping Sodbury]] (population 5,045) is contiguous with Yate to the east. In addition, a large southern section of the built-up area spills over into the parish of [[Dodington, Gloucestershire|Dodington]] (population 8,206), and so the total population of Yate's urban area is now approaching 35,000.\n\nThe town is the birthplace of [[Harry Potter]] author [[J.K. Rowling]], who lived in Yate between 1965 and 1969.\n\n==Schools==\nYate has two secondary schools, eight infant/junior schools and one special needs school.\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* Brimsham Green School\n* Yate Academy (formerly King Edmunds School)\n\n===Primary schools===\n* North Road School \n* Abbotswood School\n* Tyndale School\n* St Mary's School\n* St Paul's School\n* The Ridge\n* Wellesley School\n* Woodlands School\n*Rodford School\n\n===Special school===\n* Culverhill School\n* [https://www.sgse.org.uk/ South Gloucestershire Sports and Education]\n\n==Location==\nYate is located in [[South Gloucestershire]], which itself is in the [[South West of England]]. The town is to the north-east of Bristol city centre, which is about 11 miles away by road. A couple of miles to the south of Yate is the [[M4 motorway|M4]], which serves Yate from junctions 18 and 19. The [[South Wales Main Line]], a branch of the [[Great Western Main Line]] runs along the south of Yate. This line does not have a station in Yate. The [[Cross Country Route|Cross Country route]] from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] and the north runs through the west of Yate. [[Yate railway station]] is situated on this line. Apart from [[Chipping Sodbury]] to the east, Yate is surrounded by countryside and is situated to the south-west of [[the Cotswolds]]. The A432 is the main road to serve Yate and runs through the centre of the town.\n\nThe Yate-Chipping Sodbury conurbation is near the centre of the South Gloucestershire district. It is situated between suburban Bristol to the southwest and the Cotswold escarpment to the northeast.\n\n==Administration==\n\n=== National ===\nYate is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|the UK Parliament]] by the constituency of [[Thornbury and Yate (UK Parliament constituency)|Thornbury and Yate]].\n[[File:Aerial of Yate, South Gloucestershire, England 24May17 arp.jpg|thumb|Central Yate from an aircraft (2017), including the Sports Centre, shopping centre, [[Yate Academy]] and the Parish Church]]\n\n===County===\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Gloucestershire]] until 1974 it then became part of the district of [[Northavon]] within the newly formed [[county of Avon]]. In 1996, Avon was abolished, and the area became part of the unitary authority of [[South Gloucestershire]] and rejoined the [[ceremonial county]] of Gloucestershire.\n\n===Local===\nYate Town Council provides local services, which are displayed on their website.<ref>[http://www.yatetowncouncil.gov.uk/ Yate Town Council official website]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yate coat of arms.jpg|left|thumb|Coat of arms of Yate]]\nThe first mention of Yate is the existence of a religious house in about AD 770; Yate is also mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086. The name is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''giete'' or ''gete'', meaning 'a gateway into a forest area'.<ref>[http://www.englishtowns.net/yate/ English Towns Website]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] and well into [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], most of this part of south Gloucestershire was covered with forest. Through the centuries the land was cleared for farming.\n\nThe town's parish church, St Mary's,<ref>[http://www.acny.org.uk/venue.php?V=11803 St Mary, Yate] Diocese of Bristol</ref>\ndates from Norman times. It was altered during the 15th century and was extensively restored in 1970. St Mary's Primary School,<ref>[http://www.stmarysyate.co.uk/ St.Marys School, Yate official website]</ref> situated outside the churchyard walls, was built on the site of a former [[poorhouse]].\n\nIt was the opening of the railway station in 1844, as part of [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]], that established Yate, with Station Road becoming the central thoroughfare. The cattle and produce markets were held around this road, and businesses were established there. [[Yate railway station]] was closed by the [[Beeching cuts]] in January 1965, but was reopened in May 1989; the [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]]-built engine shed is preserved nearby.\n\nIn the 1960s Yate was designated as a development area and the building boom began. The creation of a new town included a large retail shopping area, sports and leisure development together with public buildings.\n\nWhen a secondary school was built in the late 1970s, it was supposed to be called Brinsham Green School, after Brinsham Lane at nearby Yate Rocks. Owing to a spelling error, however, it was in fact called [[Brimsham Green School]].\n\nThe town further expanded in the 1990s and 2000s with the construction of housing at North Yate. This housing estate continued to use the corrupted name of Brimsham. To locals the area is known as Brimsham Park.\n\n===Yate railway yard===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], a railway transfer yard was constructed for the [[United States Army]], probably as part of [[Operation Bolero]] to assist the buildup of troops and stores before [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. Two large storage sheds survived on the site until 2008.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the site was taken over by the [[Royal Navy]] and became known as the Sea Transport Stores Depot. It was occupied by the [[Highways Agency]] until the sheds were demolished for development. <br> [[Oxford Archaeology]]<ref>[http://www.oau-oxford.com/ Oxford Archaeology] Official Website</ref> has been commissioned to undertake an investigation as to the military significance of this site. The opinion of Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society has also been sought.<ref>[http://www.b-i-a-s.org.uk Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society (BIAS) official website]</ref>\n\nBanksy is believed to be Robin Gunningham, born on 28 July 1973 in Yate, 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from Bristol.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railway===\n{{Main|Yate railway station}}\nYate railway station serves the town. The railway station is located on the main [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] line between [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] and [[Cam & Dursley railway station|Cam & Dursley]], and is operated by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]].\n\n===Buses===\nBus services within the Yate area are mainly provided by [[First West of England]]. Other operators who provide bus services to/from Yate include Andybus, Severnside Transport and [[South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach]]. \n \nRegular bus services link Yate with Bristol city centre. There are also buses from Yate running to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cribbs Causeway]], [[Malmesbury]], [[Tetbury]] and [[Westonbirt Arboretum]]. Additionally, buses link Yate to a number of other towns/villages within South Gloucestershire including Badminton, [[Charfield]], Chipping Sodbury, [[Downend, South Gloucestershire|Downend]], [[Emersons Green]], [[Filton]], Fishponds, [[Frenchay]], [[Iron Acton]], Kingswood, [[Pucklechurch]], [[Mangotsfield]], [[Old Sodbury]], Staple Hill, Thornbury, [[Tormarton]], [[Westerleigh]], Wick, Winterbourne and [[Wotton-under-Edge]]. \n<!--WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A TIMETABLE. THIS INFO WILL RAPIDLY GO OUT OF DATE AND WHO WILL KEEP IT ACCURATE? SO COMMENTED OUT.....The majority of bus routes in the area operate Monday to Saturday only. On Sundays and bank holidays, the only bus routes serving Yate are the services to Bristol and Cribbs Causeway which operate to a reduced frequency with the first journeys being later and the final journeys being earlier than the rest of the week.-->\n\nBuses in Yate pick up and set down at Yate Bus Station which is at Yate Shopping Centre. A number of bus services also pass Yate railway station.\n\n==Design==\nMajor growth in Yate started in the early 1920s with the construction of the Moorlands Road estates behind Station Road, close to the [[Parnall]] aeroplane factory. In the 1950s the Ridge housing estate was developed. The area between these estates was still being mined for [[celestine (mineral)|celestine]] and therefore could not be built on until the mineral had been extracted.\n\nIn the 1960s the area around Stanshawes was exhausted of celestine and the housing boom started with the major construction taking place in the south. Much of this development was planned using the [[Radburn model]], a design that created a vehicle-free environment by the use of green spaces and linking paths at the front of the houses. This model was used until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the planners reverted to traditional street design methods for the development of the remainder of North Yate, Brinsham Park and the Newmans factory site.\n\n==Twin town==\nYate is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Bad Salzdetfurth]] in Germany .<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southglos.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/|title=Town twinning|date=2018-12-12|website=South Gloucestershire Council|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nBefore the Second World War, Yate had an aircraft manufacturing industry ([[Parnall]]) with a grass aerodrome.<ref>[http://www.chew76.fsnet.co.uk/parnall/parnall.html History of Parnall Aircraft].</ref> During the Second World War, Parnall specialised in making [[gun turret]]s. A number of people were killed in raids by the [[Luftwaffe]] on the factory in February and March 1941.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/97/a3604097.shtml The Bombing of Parnall's Aircraft Factory of Yate] BBC WW2 People's War</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, the Parnall factory turned to the manufacture of domestic goods and was famous for its washing machines. In 1958 Parnall merged with Radiation Ltd to become known as Jackson, producing the Jackson range of cookers. Through mergers and acquisitions, Jacksons is now part of [[Indesit]] and the Jackson name is no longer used.\n\nNewman's of Bristol had a large factory on Station Road, from 1932 until the 1980s, in its heyday in the 1960s, employing over 1,500 people.\n\nYate has had three natural products associated with it: [[limestone]] to the east, celestine or spar near the centre of the town and [[coal]] to the west.\n\nThe need for limestone increased with the growth of roads, while the demand for coal grew with the diminishing supply of timber. Celestine, the major [[strontium]] mineral, was first dug in the late 1880s and was initially used for the refining of [[sugar beet]]. At one time Yate's celestine accounted for 95 per cent of the world's production.<ref>Ian S. Bishop, Around Yate and the Sodburys (Nottingham: Adlard Print and Reprographics Ltd, 2010), 1.</ref> It colours flames red, and so was important for pyrotechnics such as fireworks, military and signal flares and tracer bullets. The last commercial excavation of celestine from the Yate area was for use during the [[Vietnam War]]. The mining company, Bristol Mineral and Land Co, closed in 1994.\n\n==Shopping==\n[[File:Yate.shopping.centre.arp.jpg|thumb|Yate shopping centre has over 100 shops]]\nConstruction of a pedestrianised shopping centre of around a hundred shops began in the early-to-mid-1960s.<ref>[http://www.yateshoppingcentre.co.uk/ Yate Shopping centre]</ref> The shopping centre was opened by [[Patricia Phoenix]], (who played [[Elsie Tanner]] in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Coronation Street]]''), [[Mary Rand]] (athlete) and [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]] (comedian). As with the most British net towns, modern art was included in the design: in the case of Yate, this was in the form of the Four Seasons sculpture, and a graceful and dramatic spire-shaped sculpture, which could be seen for miles, mounted high above the centre on the roof of one of the shops. This sculpture existed until the early 1990s when it was removed during the revamping of the centre, which included the erection of glass roofs over the walkways. An extension to East Walk was constructed at the start of the 1980s, and this included the construction of a new Tesco store, with the old store in South Walk turned into a Tesco Home and Wear store. An extension to West Walk was constructed in the early 1990s.\n\nYate shopping centre housed a single screen cinema until the early 1980s. It was closed and replaced with Spirals nightclub. The club closed in the 2000s and was replaced with Rileys pool club and then by Waves, another club. Waves closed in 2012. A youth centre called Armadillo opened in 2011.\n\nShops in the centre include [[Tesco]], [[Boots Group|Boots]] [[Dispensing chemist|chemist]], [[Halfords]] Metro, [[Iceland (supermarket)]], Argos, [[Superdrug]] and the Entertainer. Eating places in the centre include [[McDonald's]], Boswells and Wetherspoons.\n\nDuring the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, the shopping centre hosted Yate's annual festival. On opening day a celebrity launched the festival by releasing balloons and stayed to sign autographs. Celebrities have included Carole Lee Scott, in character as [[Grotbags]] (from [[Rod Hull]] and [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]'s enemy), [[Timmy Mallett]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Ross Kemp]] (''[[EastEnders]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]), Ken Morley (''[[Coronation Street]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Reg Holdsworth), [[David Neilson]] (''Coronation Street''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Roy Cropper]]), [[Beverley Callard]] (''Coronation Street''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Liz McDonald]]), [[Bob Carolgees]] and Spit the Dog, and the [[Milky Bar Kid]]. The festival also brought along a number of news presenters from [[HTV West]] including Bruce Hockin, Richard Wyatt and [[Peter Rowell]].\n\nOn 19 November 2009, a large crowd packed into the shopping centre to see [[Peter Andre]] switch on the town's Christmas lights and sing his single \"Unconditional\".\n\nOn 15 November 2012, [[Steps (group)|Steps]] plus a finalist (still to be announced) from the 2012 series of the [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]] were due to switch on the town centre's Christmas lights.\n\nIn December 2006, the owners of the shopping centre (Dominion Corporate Trustees) announced plans to enlarge and modernise it. In Phase 1 one of the main changes has been the replacement of the existing small Tesco with a large Tesco Extra. To replace lost shopping centre parking following the enlargement, the store is on stilts, with parking beneath. It opened on 24 October 2011.\n\nLocated near the shopping centre are [[Lidl]], [[Morrisons]] and [[B&Q]]. There are two [[Tesco Express]] stores in Yate: one on Station Road and one in Brimsham Park. The B&Q was built in the mid-to-late 1980s, along with two small housing estates, on the site of the Newman's electric motor factory which had been demolished in the mid-1980s. There is also a [[Screwfix]] branch located on one of the trading estates.\n\nThe shopping centre also has a [[Jobcentre Plus]], [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], library, leisure centre, over-50s caf\u00e9 and a health centre.\n\nIn 2008, construction of a new health centre began on the site of the old one, costing around \u00a312&nbsp;million. The new West Gate Health Centre (formerly the West Walk Health Centre) was officially opened on 8 March 2010.\n\nIn August 2009, plans were agreed for [[Tesco]] to pull down their store and replace it with a more modern store, known as a [[Tesco Extra]]. The plans include four more shop units, moving the bus station and a revamped entrance to East Walk. The revamp of the town's bus station was officially opened in January 2010. A temporary Tesco store was opened on 28 February 2011 while the new Tesco Extra was under construction. The old [[Tesco]] closed its doors on 27 February 2011 and the [[Tesco Extra]] store opened on 24 October 2011.\n\nIt was revealed in September 2011 that Marks and Spencer have asked for planning permission for a new store in two of the four new units, on which building work will commence in October 2012. The other two units will be occupied by [[Costa Coffee]] and [[Sports Direct]]. This second phase of the centre's expansion plans is being built next to [[Superdrug]], in East Walk (opposite the Tesco Extra store). The public toilets next to the Superdrug store will be demolished and re-built on West Walk.\n\nJ. D. Wetherspoons public house and restaurant opened in the summer of 2012, on the corner of South Walk/South Parade, occupying several units, including the former Motorworld store.\n\nIn September 2014, it was finally announced that Yate would get a new cinema. The cinema would be operated by Cineworld and would be part of a further expansion to the Yate Shopping Centre, which was also to include seven restaurants. The extension was built on and behind the current overflow carpark on Link Road, on the other side from the Tesco Extra store, and was called 'Yate Riverside'. Construction began in early 2015 and the cinema opened in spring 2016.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Yate.kingsgate.park.arp.jpg|thumb|Kingsgate Park]]\nThe town has a skatepark at Peghill. Yate Common on Westerleigh Road is used for dog walking, nature watching, kite flying, circuses and fairs.\n\nThe common has a stretch of unused [[dual carriageway]] ({{Coord|51.532282|-2.433879}}), known as the \"road to nowhere\", which has been used for filming in TV programmes such as ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.<ref>[http://www.southglos.gov.uk/NR/exeres/091ef4b1-5f57-4045-b02a-88976d918fb3 South Gloucestershire council hires out many venues for filming / training purposes]</ref> This was part a scheme to create a bypass from Rodford Way in South Yate to Nibley.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The scheme was only partially completed in 1974, the year when Yate became a part of Avon. Completion of the road would have entailed building a bridge over the railway, but finance for this was never made available.\n\nThe town has several parks and areas of open space. The largest of these is Kingsgate Park, which has an adventure playground for children.\n\nThe town is served by a community radio station, [[GLOSS FM]] which broadcasts 365 days a year on its webcasts and twice a year on 87.7&nbsp;MHz FM.\n\nA Cineworld cinema opened in the new riverside shopping centre in April 2016.\n\nThe town benefits from a four appliance firestation, with a retained Crew 24 hours and the further tenders manned on a voluntary basis.\nNext to the firestation is a 6 bay ambulance station with a further 3 ambulances and 2 response cars stabled outside.\n\n==Plans==\nYate and Chipping Sodbury have been earmarked for 5,000 new homes to be built by 2026. While the location of the housing has yet to be decided, the expected areas are to the north of Yate, and towards Chipping Sodbury.\n\n==Local sport==\n\n===Athletics===\nYate and District Athletic Club<ref>[http://www.yateac.co.uk/ Yate and District Athletic Club official website]</ref> is a track-and-field club based at Yate Outdoor Sports Centre.

The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.
