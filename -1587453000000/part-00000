They can be re-elected, but cannot serve more than three consecutive terms. Around eighty percent of congressmen are district representatives, representing a particular geographical area. The 18th Congress has 243<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/members/?v=region|title=HOUSE MEMBERS by REGION|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress of the Philippines - House of Representatives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]], each composed of about 250,000 people. There are also [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party-list representatives]] elected through the party-list system who constitute not more than twenty percent of the total number of representatives.\n\nAside from needing its agreement to every bill in order to be sent for the [[President of the Philippines|President]]'s signature to become law, the House of Representatives has power to impeach certain officials and all [[money bill]]s must originate from the lower house.\n\nThe House of Representatives is headed by the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]], currently [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] of [[Legislative district of Pateros\u2013Taguig|Taguig-Pateros]]. The Speaker of the House is the third in the [[Philippine presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], after the Vice President and Senate President. The official headquarters of the House of Representatives is at the ''[[Batasang Pambansa Complex|Batasang Pambansa]]'' ({{literal translation|''national legislature''}}) located in the [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]] in [[Quezon City]] in [[Metro Manila]]. The building is often simply called ''Batasan'' and the word has also become a [[metonym]] to refer to the House of Representatives.\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of Philippines}}\n[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|left|thumbnail|Joint session of the Philippine Legislature, Manila. November 15, 1916]]\n[[File:Philippine Legislature before 1924.jpg|left|thumbnail|Philippine legislature before 1924]]\n\n[[File:Philippine House of Representatives party-control.png|thumb|260px|Party control of the lower house. Notice the one-party dominance of the [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalistas]] from 1907 to 1941, the two-party system with the emergence of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 1946, the return of one-party dominance by the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan|KBL]] from 1978 to 1984, and the multiparty system from 1987 to the present.]]\n[[File:Philippine House of Representatives party-control seat totals.png|thumb|260px|Same as above, but in cumulative seat totals, instead of percentages.]]\n\n===Philippine Assembly===\n{{Main|Philippine Assembly}}\n\nAt the beginning of [[United States|American]] colonial rule, from March 16, 1900, the sole national [[legislative body]] was the [[Philippine Commission]] with all members appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  Headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] the body exercised all legislative authority given to it by the President and the [[United States Congress]] until October 1907 when it was joined by the Philippine Assembly.  [[William Howard Taft]] was chosen to be the first American civilian Governor-General and the first leader of this Philippine Commission, which subsequently became known as the Taft Commission.\n\nThe [[Philippine Bill of 1902]], a basic law, or [[organic act]], of the [[Insular Government]], mandated that once certain conditions were met a [[bicameral]], or two-chamber, [[Philippine Legislature]] would be created with the previously existing, all-appointed Philippine Commission as the [[upper house]] and the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the [[lower house]].  This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in October 1907.  Under the leadership of Speaker [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] and Floor Leader [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the Rules of the [[59th United States Congress]] was substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature. Osme\u00f1a and Quezon led the [[Nacionalista Party]], with a platform of independence from the United States, into successive electoral victories against the [[Progresista Party]] and later the [[Democrata Party]], which first advocated United States statehood, then opposed immediate independence.\n\nIt is this body, founded as the Philippine Assembly, that would continue in one form or another, and with a few different names, up until the present day.\n\n===Jones Act of 1916===\n{{Main|Jones Law (Philippines)}}\n\nIn 1916, the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act]], officially the Philippine Autonomy Act, changed the legislative system.  The Philippine Commission was abolished and a new fully elected, bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] was established. The Nacionalistas continued their electoral dominance at this point, although they were split into two factions led by Osme\u00f1a and Quezon; the two reconciled in 1924, and controlled the Assembly via a virtual [[dominant-party system]].\n\n===Commonwealth and the Third Republic===\n{{Main|National Assembly of the Philippines}}\n\nThe legislative system was changed again in 1935.  The 1935 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] established a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]]. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was adopted.\n\nUpon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic. The \"Liberal bloc\" of the Nacionalistas permanently split from their ranks, creating the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. These two will contest all of the elections in what appeared to be a [[two-party system]]. The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient enough number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that the president will have control of the House of Representatives.\n\n===Martial Law===\n{{Main|Batasang Pambansa}}\nThis set up continued until President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared martial law and abolished Congress. He would rule by decree even after the 1973 Constitution abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral ''Batasang Pambansa'' parliamentary system of government, as parliamentary election would not occur in [[1978 Philippine parliamentary election|1978]]. Marcos' [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL; New Society Movement) won all of the seats except those from the [[Central Visayas]] ushering in an era of KBL dominance, which will continue until the [[People Power Revolution]] overthrew Marcos in 1986.\n\n===1987 Constitution===\nThe 1987 Constitution restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines. One deviation from the previous setup was the introduction of the mid-term election; however, the dynamics of the House of Representatives resumed its pre-1972 state, with the party of the president controlling the chamber, although political pluralism ensued that prevented the restoration of the old Nacionalista-Liberal two-party system. Instead, a [[multi-party system]] evolved.\n\n[[Corazon Aquino]] who nominally had no party, supported the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of the Democratic Filipinos). With the victory of [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in the [[1992 Philippine presidential election|1992 presidential election]], many representatives defected to his [[Lakas-NUCD]] party; the same would happen with [[Joseph Estrada]]'s victory in [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998]], but he lost support when he was ousted after the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]] that brought his vice president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to power. This also meant the restoration of Lakas-NUCD as the top party in the chamber. The same would happen when [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno Aquino]] [[2010 Philippine presidential election|won in 2010]], which returned the Liberals into power.\n\nThe presiding officer is the [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Unlike the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the Speaker usually serves the entire term of Congress, although there had been instances when the Speaker left office due to conflict with the president: examples include [[Jose de Venecia Jr.]]'s resignation as speaker in 2008 when his son [[Joey de Venecia]] exposed alleged corrupt practices by First Gentleman [[Mike Arroyo]], and [[Manny Villar]]'s ouster occurred after he allowed the impeachment of President Estrada in 2000.\n\n==Officers==\nThe members of the House of Representatives who are also its officers are also ''[[ex officio]]'' members of all of the [[List of Philippine House of Representatives committees|committees]] and have a vote.\n\n===Speaker===\n{{main|Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThe Speaker is the head of the House of Representatives. He presides over the session; decides on all questions of order, subject to appeal by any member; signs all acts, resolutions, memorials, writs, warrants and subpoenas issued by or upon order of the House; appoints, suspends, dismisses or disciplines House personnel; and exercise administrative functions.\n\nThe speaker is elected by majority of all the members of the house, including vacant seats. The speaker is traditionally elected at the convening of each Congress. Before a speaker is elected, the House's sergeant-at-arms sits as the \"Presiding Officer\" until a speaker is elected. Compared to the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the unseating of an incumbent speaker is rarer.\n\n{{As of|2019|July|post=,}} the incumbent speaker is [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] ([[Nacionalista Party]]) of [[Legislative district of Taguig-Pateros|Taguig City-Pateros]].\n\n===Deputy Speakers===\n{{main|Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThere was a position of speaker ''pro tempore'' for congresses prior the reorganization of the officers of the House of Representatives during the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]] in 1995. The speaker ''pro tempore'' was the next highest position in the House after the speaker.\n\nThe position was replaced by deputy speakers in 1995. Originally, there was one Deputy Speaker for each [[island groups of the Philippines|island group]] of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Then, in 2001 during the [[12th Congress of the Philippines|12th Congress]], a Deputy Speaker \"at large\" was created. In the next Congress, another \"at large\" deputy speakership was created, along with a Deputy Speaker for women. In the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]] starting in 2010, all six deputy speakers are \"at large\".\n\nThe deputy speakers perform the speaker's role when the speaker is absent. Currently in the 16th Congress, the deputy speakers represent the chamber at-large.\n\nThe Deputy Speakers are:\n*[[Paolo Duterte]] ([[Legislative districts of Davao City#1st District|Davao City\u20131st]], [[Hugpong ng Pagbabago]])\n*Ferdinand L.

The secretary general presides over the chamber at the first legislative session after an election, and is elected by a majority of the members.\n\nAs of 22 July 2019, Atty. Jose Luis Montales is the Secretary General of the House of Representatives.\n\n===Sergeant-at-Arms===\nThe Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the maintenance of order in the House of Representatives, among other things. Like the Secretary General, the Sergeant-at-Arms is elected by a majority of the members.\n\nAs of 22 July 2019, Retired Police Deputy Director General Ramon Apolinario is the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Membership ==\nThere are two types of congressmen: those who represent geographic districts, and those who represent certain sectors. The [[first-past-the-post]] (simple plurality voting) method is used to determine who represents each of the 238 geographic districts. The sectoral representatives are elected via the party-list system. The sectoral representatives should always comprise 20% of the seats.\n\nOriginally set at 200 in the ordinance of the constitution, the number of districts has grown to 238. All of the new districts are via created via piecemeal redistricting of the then existing 200 districts, and via the creation of new provinces and cities. The constitution gave Congress to nationally redistrict the country after the release of every census, but this has not been done. The newest congressional district in the country is Cebu's 7th district, via the passage of Republic Act No. 10684.\n\nThe original 200 districts meant that there should have been 50 party-list representatives. However, the constitution did not give the specifics on how party-list congressmen should have been elected. This led to presidents appointing sectoral representatives, which were then approved by the Commission on Appointments; only a handful of sectoral representatives were seated in this way. The first party-list election was in 1998; with the 2% election threshold, a 3-seat cap and tens of parties participating, this led to only about a fraction of the party-list seats being distributed. Eventually, there had been several Supreme Court decisions changing the way the winning seats are distributed, ensuring that all party-list seats are filled up.\n\nAs there are 243 congressional districts, there are 60 party-list representatives, for a total of 303 congressmen.\n\n=== District representation ===\n{{main|Legislative districts of the Philippines}}\nEighty percent of representatives shall come from congressional districts, with each district returning one representative. Although each district should have a population of at least 250,000 people, all [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] have at least one legislative district, regardless of population, whose residents vote for their own congressman; several [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] have representation of their own, independent of provinces, although they should have at least a population of 250,000. For provinces that have more than one legislative district, the provincial districts are identical to the corresponding legislative district, with the exclusion of cities that do not vote for provincial officials.\n\nThe representatives from the districts comprise at most 80% of the members of the House; therefore, for a party to have a majority of seats in the House, the party needs to win at least 60% of the district seats. No party since the approval of the 1987 constitution has been able to win a majority of seats, hence coalitions are not uncommon.\n\n==== Legislative districts in provinces ====\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Legislative district of Abra|Abra]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte|Agusan del Norte]] (2){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Butuan]] remains part of Agusan del Norte's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Agusan del Sur|Agusan del Sur]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Aklan|Aklan]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Albay|Albay]] (3)\n* [[Legislative district of Antique|Antique]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Apayao|Apayao]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Aurora|Aurora]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Basilan|Basilan]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bataan|Bataan]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Batanes|Batanes]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Batangas|Batangas]] (6){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Batangas City|Batangas]] and [[Lipa, Batangas|Lipa]] are officially known as the 5th and 6th Districts of Batangas, respectively.}} \n* [[Legislative district of Benguet|Benguet]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Biliran|Biliran]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bohol|Bohol]] (3)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bukidnon|Bukidnon]] (4)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|Bulacan]] (4){{efn|group=provinces|The component city of [[San Jose del Monte]] is represented separately from Bulacan, but remains as part of the province's 1st District for the purpose of electing [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cagayan|Cagayan]] (3)\n* [[Legislative district of Camarines Norte|Camarines Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Camarines Sur|Camarines Sur]] (5){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] remains part of Camarines Sur's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Camiguin|Camiguin]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Capiz|Capiz]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Catanduanes|Catanduanes]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Cavite|Cavite]] (8){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Bacoor]], [[Dasmari\u00f1as]], [[General Trias, Cavite|General Trias]] and [[Imus]] are officially known as the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 3rd Districts of Cavite, respectively.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cebu|Cebu]] (7){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Mandaue]] remains part of Cebu's congressional representation until 2022.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cotabato|Cotabato]] (3)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao de Oro|Davao de Oro]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao del Norte|Davao del Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Davao Occidental|Davao Occidental]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao Oriental|Davao Oriental]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur|Davao del Sur]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Dinagat Islands|Dinagat Islands]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Eastern Samar|Eastern Samar]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Guimaras|Guimaras]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Ifugao|Ifugao]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Ilocos Norte|Ilocos Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Ilocos Sur|Ilocos Sur]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Iloilo|Iloilo]] (5)\n* [[Legislative districts of Isabela|Isabela]] (6){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Santiago (Philippine city)|Santiago]] remains part of Isabela's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Kalinga|Kalinga]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of La Union|La Union]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Laguna|Laguna]] (4){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Bi\u00f1an]] and [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] are represented separately from Laguna, but remains as part of the province's 1st and 2nd Districts, respectively, for the purpose of electing [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members.

representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThe party-list system is the name designated for party-list representation. Under the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the electorate can vote for certain party-list organizations in order to give voice to significant minorities of society that would otherwise not be adequately represented through geographical district. From 1987\u20131998, party-list representatives were appointed by the President.\n\nSince 1998, each voter votes for a single party-list organization. Organizations that garner at least 2% of the total number of votes are awarded one representative for every 2% up to a maximum of three representatives. Thus, there can be at most 50 party-list representatives in Congress, though usually no more than 20 are elected because many organizations do not reach the required 2% minimum number of votes.\n\nAfter the [[2007 Philippine House of Representatives elections|2007 election]], in a controversial decision, the Supreme Court ordered the COMELEC to change how it allocates the party-list seats. Under the new formula only one party will have the maximum 3 seats. It based its decision on a formula contained in the ''VFP vs. COMELEC'' decision. In 2009, in the ''BANAT vs. COMELEC'' decision, it was changed anew in which parties with less than 2% of the vote were given seats to fulfill the 20% quota as set forth in the constitution.\n\nAside from determining which party won and allocating the number of seats won per party, another point of contention was whether the nominees should be a member of the marginalized group they are supposed to represent; in the ''Ang Bagong Bayani vs. COMELEC'' decision, the Supreme Court not only ruled that the nominees should be a member of the marginalized sector, but it also disallowed major political parties from participating in the party-list election. However, on the ''BANAT'' decision, the court ruled hat since the law didn't specify who belongs to a marginalized sector, the court allowed anyone to be a nominee as long as the nominee as a member of the ''party'' (not necessarily the marginalized group the party is supposed to represent).\n\n==Redistricting==\n[[File:Philippine congressional districts population.png|thumb|Population of each congressional district in the Philippines.

Therefore, apportionment often can be influenced by political motivations. Incumbent representatives who are not permitted by law to serve after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that their allies be able to run, while \"switching offices\" with them. Likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.\n\nSince 1987, the creation of some new congressional districts have been met with controversy, especially due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some of these new congressional districts are tied to the creation of a new province, because such an act necessarily entails the creation of a new congressional district.\n* '''Creation of [[Davao Occidental]], 2013:''' The rival Cagas and Bautista clans dominate politics in the province of [[Davao del Sur]]; their members have been elected as congressional representatives for the [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#1st District|first]] and [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#2nd District|second districts]] of the province since 1987.

Once a bill is approved by the House of Representatives on third reading, the bill is passed to the Senate, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house.

The building was damaged beyond repair and Congress convened at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Quezon Memorial Book|date=1952|publisher=Quezon Memorial Committee}}</ref> (modern-day S. H. Loyola) Street, Manila until the Legislative Building can be occupied again in 1949. Congress stayed at the Legislative Building, by now called the Congress Building, until President Marcos shut Congress and ruled by decree starting in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings_ancestral |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Ancestral Quarters |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\nMarcos then oversaw the construction of the new home of parliament at [[Quezon City]], which convened in 1978. The parliament, called the Batasang Pambansa continued to sit there until the passage of the [[Constitution of the Philippines#\"Freedom Constitution\" (1986)|1986 Freedom Constitution]]. The House of Representatives inherited the Batasang Pambansa Complex in 1987.\n\n===Batasang Pambansa Complex===\nThe Batasang Pambansa Complex, now officially called the House of Representatives Building Complex, is at the National Government Center, Constitution Hills, Quezon City. Accessible via [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]], the complex consists of four buildings. The Main Building hosts the session hall; the North and South wings, inaugurated in December 1977, are attached to it. The newest building, the Ramon Mitra, Jr. Building, was completed in 2001. It houses the Legislative Library, the Committee offices, the Reference and Research Bureau, and the Conference Rooms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Present Legislative Building |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\n== Current composition ==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|18th Congress of the Philippines}}{{further|List of Philippine House of Representatives committees}}\nThe members of the House of Representatives, aside from being grouped into political parties, are also grouped into the \"majority bloc\", \"minority bloc\" and \"independents\" (different from the independent in the sense that they are not affiliated into a political party). Originally, members who voted for the winning Speaker belong to the majority and members who voted for the opponent are the minority. The majority and minority bloc are to elect amongst themselves a floor leader. While members are allowed to switch blocs, they must do so in writing. Also, the bloc where they intend to transfer shall accept their application through writing. When the bloc the member ought to transfer refuses to accept the transferring member, or a member does not want to be a member of either bloc, that member becomes an independent member. A member that transfers to a new bloc forfeits one's committee chairmanships and memberships, until the bloc the member transfers to elects the member to committees.\n\nThe membership in each committee should be in proportion to the size of each bloc, with each bloc deciding who amongst them who will go to each committee, upon a motion by the floor leader concerned to the House of Representatives in plenary. The Speaker, Deputy Speakers, floor leaders, deputy floor leaders and the chairperson of the Committee on Accounts can vote in committees; the committee chairperson can only vote to break a tie.\n\nTo ensure that the representatives each get their pork barrel, most of them will join the majority bloc, or even to the president's party, as basis of [[patronage politics]] (known as the [[Padrino System]] locally); thus, the House of Representatives always aligns itself with the party of the sitting president.\n\nThe majority bloc sits at the right side of the speaker, facing the House of Representatives.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" wikitable sortable style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n====District representatives====\n! width=\"120px\"| [[Province of the

They can be re-elected, but cannot serve more than three consecutive terms. Around eighty percent of congressmen are district representatives, representing a particular geographical area. The 18th Congress has 243<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/members/?v=region|title=HOUSE MEMBERS by REGION|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress of the Philippines - House of Representatives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]], each composed of about 250,000 people. There are also [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party-list representatives]] elected through the party-list system who constitute not more than twenty percent of the total number of representatives.\n\nAside from needing its agreement to every bill in order to be sent for the [[President of the Philippines|President]]'s signature to become law, the House of Representatives has power to impeach certain officials and all [[money bill]]s must originate from the lower house.\n\nThe House of Representatives is headed by the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]], currently [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] of [[Legislative district of Pateros\u2013Taguig|Taguig-Pateros]]. The Speaker of the House is the third in the [[Philippine presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], after the Vice President and Senate President. The official headquarters of the House of Representatives is at the ''[[Batasang Pambansa Complex|Batasang Pambansa]]'' ({{literal translation|''national legislature''}}) located in the [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]] in [[Quezon City]] in [[Metro Manila]]. The building is often simply called ''Batasan'' and the word has also become a [[metonym]] to refer to the House of Representatives.\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of Philippines}}\n[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|left|thumbnail|Joint session of the Philippine Legislature, Manila. November 15, 1916]]\n[[File:Philippine Legislature before 1924.jpg|left|thumbnail|Philippine legislature before 1924]]\n\n[[File:Philippine House of Representatives party-control.png|thumb|260px|Party control of the lower house. Notice the one-party dominance of the [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalistas]] from 1907 to 1941, the two-party system with the emergence of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 1946, the return of one-party dominance by the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan|KBL]] from 1978 to 1984, and the multiparty system from 1987 to the present.]]\n[[File:Philippine House of Representatives party-control seat totals.png|thumb|260px|Same as above, but in cumulative seat totals, instead of percentages.]]\n\n===Philippine Assembly===\n{{Main|Philippine Assembly}}\n\nAt the beginning of [[United States|American]] colonial rule, from March 16, 1900, the sole national [[legislative body]] was the [[Philippine Commission]] with all members appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  Headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] the body exercised all legislative authority given to it by the President and the [[United States Congress]] until October 1907 when it was joined by the Philippine Assembly.  [[William Howard Taft]] was chosen to be the first American civilian Governor-General and the first leader of this Philippine Commission, which subsequently became known as the Taft Commission.\n\nThe [[Philippine Bill of 1902]], a basic law, or [[organic act]], of the [[Insular Government]], mandated that once certain conditions were met a [[bicameral]], or two-chamber, [[Philippine Legislature]] would be created with the previously existing, all-appointed Philippine Commission as the [[upper house]] and the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the [[lower house]].  This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in October 1907.  Under the leadership of Speaker [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] and Floor Leader [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the Rules of the [[59th United States Congress]] was substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature. Osme\u00f1a and Quezon led the [[Nacionalista Party]], with a platform of independence from the United States, into successive electoral victories against the [[Progresista Party]] and later the [[Democrata Party]], which first advocated United States statehood, then opposed immediate independence.\n\nIt is this body, founded as the Philippine Assembly, that would continue in one form or another, and with a few different names, up until the present day.\n\n===Jones Act of 1916===\n{{Main|Jones Law (Philippines)}}\n\nIn 1916, the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act]], officially the Philippine Autonomy Act, changed the legislative system.  The Philippine Commission was abolished and a new fully elected, bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] was established. The Nacionalistas continued their electoral dominance at this point, although they were split into two factions led by Osme\u00f1a and Quezon; the two reconciled in 1924, and controlled the Assembly via a virtual [[dominant-party system]].\n\n===Commonwealth and the Third Republic===\n{{Main|National Assembly of the Philippines}}\n\nThe legislative system was changed again in 1935.  The 1935 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] established a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]]. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was adopted.\n\nUpon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic. The \"Liberal bloc\" of the Nacionalistas permanently split from their ranks, creating the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. These two will contest all of the elections in what appeared to be a [[two-party system]]. The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient enough number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that the president will have control of the House of Representatives.\n\n===Martial Law===\n{{Main|Batasang Pambansa}}\nThis set up continued until President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared martial law and abolished Congress. He would rule by decree even after the 1973 Constitution abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral ''Batasang Pambansa'' parliamentary system of government, as parliamentary election would not occur in [[1978 Philippine parliamentary election|1978]]. Marcos' [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL; New Society Movement) won all of the seats except those from the [[Central Visayas]] ushering in an era of KBL dominance, which will continue until the [[People Power Revolution]] overthrew Marcos in 1986.\n\n===1987 Constitution===\nThe 1987 Constitution restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines. One deviation from the previous setup was the introduction of the mid-term election; however, the dynamics of the House of Representatives resumed its pre-1972 state, with the party of the president controlling the chamber, although political pluralism ensued that prevented the restoration of the old Nacionalista-Liberal two-party system. Instead, a [[multi-party system]] evolved.\n\n[[Corazon Aquino]] who nominally had no party, supported the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of the Democratic Filipinos). With the victory of [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in the [[1992 Philippine presidential election|1992 presidential election]], many representatives defected to his [[Lakas-NUCD]] party; the same would happen with [[Joseph Estrada]]'s victory in [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998]], but he lost support when he was ousted after the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]] that brought his vice president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to power. This also meant the restoration of Lakas-NUCD as the top party in the chamber. The same would happen when [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno Aquino]] [[2010 Philippine presidential election|won in 2010]], which returned the Liberals into power.\n\nThe presiding officer is the [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Unlike the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the Speaker usually serves the entire term of Congress, although there had been instances when the Speaker left office due to conflict with the president: examples include [[Jose de Venecia Jr.]]'s resignation as speaker in 2008 when his son [[Joey de Venecia]] exposed alleged corrupt practices by First Gentleman [[Mike Arroyo]], and [[Manny Villar]]'s ouster occurred after he allowed the impeachment of President Estrada in 2000.\n\n==Officers==\nThe members of the House of Representatives who are also its officers are also ''[[ex officio]]'' members of all of the [[List of Philippine House of Representatives committees|committees]] and have a vote.\n\n===Speaker===\n{{main|Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThe Speaker is the head of the House of Representatives. He presides over the session; decides on all questions of order, subject to appeal by any member; signs all acts, resolutions, memorials, writs, warrants and subpoenas issued by or upon order of the House; appoints, suspends, dismisses or disciplines House personnel; and exercise administrative functions.\n\nThe speaker is elected by majority of all the members of the house, including vacant seats. The speaker is traditionally elected at the convening of each Congress. Before a speaker is elected, the House's sergeant-at-arms sits as the \"Presiding Officer\" until a speaker is elected. Compared to the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the unseating of an incumbent speaker is rarer.\n\n{{As of|2019|July|post=,}} the incumbent speaker is [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] ([[Nacionalista Party]]) of [[Legislative district of Taguig-Pateros|Taguig City-Pateros]].\n\n===Deputy Speakers===\n{{main|Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThere was a position of speaker ''pro tempore'' for congresses prior the reorganization of the officers of the House of Representatives during the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]] in 1995. The speaker ''pro tempore'' was the next highest position in the House after the speaker.\n\nThe position was replaced by deputy speakers in 1995. Originally, there was one Deputy Speaker for each [[island groups of the Philippines|island group]] of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Then, in 2001 during the [[12th Congress of the Philippines|12th Congress]], a Deputy Speaker \"at large\" was created. In the next Congress, another \"at large\" deputy speakership was created, along with a Deputy Speaker for women. In the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]] starting in 2010, all six deputy speakers are \"at large\".\n\nThe deputy speakers perform the speaker's role when the speaker is absent. Currently in the 16th Congress, the deputy speakers represent the chamber at-large.\n\nThe Deputy Speakers are:\n*[[Paolo Duterte]] ([[Legislative districts of Davao City#1st District|Davao City\u20131st]], [[Hugpong ng Pagbabago]])\n*Ferdinand L.

The Majority Leader is also concurrently the Chairman of the Committee on Rules. The majority leader is elected in a party caucus of the ruling majority party.\n\nThe incumbent majority floor leader is [[Martin Romualdez|Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez]] ([[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|Lakas-CMD]]) of [[Leyte]]'s [[Legislative districts of Leyte|First district]].\n\n===Minority Floor Leader===\n{{main|Minority Floor Leader of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThe minority leader is the spokesman of the minority party in the House and is an ''[[ex-officio]]'' member of all standing Committees. The minority leader is elected in party caucus of all Members of the House in the minority party, although by tradition, the losing candidate for speaker is named the minority leader.\n\nThe incumbent minority floor leader is [[Benny Abante|Bienvinido M. Abante Jr.]] ([[Asenso Manile\u00f1o]]) of [[Manila]]'s [[Legislative districts of Manila#6th District|6th District]].\n\n===Secretary General===\nThe secretary general enforces orders and decisions of the House; keeps the Journal of each session; notes all questions of order, among other things. The secretary general presides over the chamber at the first legislative session after an election, and is elected by a majority of the members.\n\nAs of 22 July 2019, Atty. Jose Luis Montales is the Secretary General of the House of Representatives.\n\n===Sergeant-at-Arms===\nThe Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the maintenance of order in the House of Representatives, among other things. Like the Secretary General, the Sergeant-at-Arms is elected by a majority of the members.\n\nAs of 22 July 2019, Retired Police Deputy Director General Ramon Apolinario is the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Membership ==\nThere are two types of congressmen: those who represent geographic districts, and those who represent certain sectors. The [[first-past-the-post]] (simple plurality voting) method is used to determine who represents each of the 238 geographic districts. The sectoral representatives are elected via the party-list system. The sectoral representatives should always comprise 20% of the seats.\n\nOriginally set at 200 in the ordinance of the constitution, the number of districts has grown to 238. All of the new districts are via created via piecemeal redistricting of the then existing 200 districts, and via the creation of new provinces and cities. The constitution gave Congress to nationally redistrict the country after the release of every census, but this has not been done. The newest congressional district in the country is Cebu's 7th district, via the passage of Republic Act No. 10684.\n\nThe original 200 districts meant that there should have been 50 party-list representatives. However, the constitution did not give the specifics on how party-list congressmen should have been elected. This led to presidents appointing sectoral representatives, which were then approved by the Commission on Appointments; only a handful of sectoral representatives were seated in this way. The first party-list election was in 1998; with the 2% election threshold, a 3-seat cap and tens of parties participating, this led to only about a fraction of the party-list seats being distributed. Eventually, there had been several Supreme Court decisions changing the way the winning seats are distributed, ensuring that all party-list seats are filled up.\n\nAs there are 243 congressional districts, there are 60 party-list representatives, for a total of 303 congressmen.\n\n=== District representation ===\n{{main|Legislative districts of the Philippines}}\nEighty percent of representatives shall come from congressional districts, with each district returning one representative. Although each district should have a population of at least 250,000 people, all [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] have at least one legislative district, regardless of population, whose residents vote for their own congressman; several [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] have representation of their own, independent of provinces, although they should have at least a population of 250,000. For provinces that have more than one legislative district, the provincial districts are identical to the corresponding legislative district, with the exclusion of cities that do not vote for provincial officials.\n\nThe representatives from the districts comprise at most 80% of the members of the House; therefore, for a party to have a majority of seats in the House, the party needs to win at least 60% of the district seats. No party since the approval of the 1987 constitution has been able to win a majority of seats, hence coalitions are not uncommon.\n\n==== Legislative districts in provinces ====\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Legislative district of Abra|Abra]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte|Agusan del Norte]] (2){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Butuan]] remains part of Agusan del Norte's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Agusan del Sur|Agusan del Sur]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Aklan|Aklan]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Albay|Albay]] (3)\n* [[Legislative district of Antique|Antique]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Apayao|Apayao]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Aurora|Aurora]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Basilan|Basilan]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bataan|Bataan]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Batanes|Batanes]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Batangas|Batangas]] (6){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Batangas City|Batangas]] and [[Lipa, Batangas|Lipa]] are officially known as the 5th and 6th Districts of Batangas, respectively.}} \n* [[Legislative district of Benguet|Benguet]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Biliran|Biliran]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bohol|Bohol]] (3)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bukidnon|Bukidnon]] (4)\n* [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|Bulacan]] (4){{efn|group=provinces|The component city of [[San Jose del Monte]] is represented separately from Bulacan, but remains as part of the province's 1st District for the purpose of electing [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cagayan|Cagayan]] (3)\n* [[Legislative district of Camarines Norte|Camarines Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Camarines Sur|Camarines Sur]] (5){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] remains part of Camarines Sur's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Camiguin|Camiguin]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Capiz|Capiz]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Catanduanes|Catanduanes]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Cavite|Cavite]] (8){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Bacoor]], [[Dasmari\u00f1as]], [[General Trias, Cavite|General Trias]] and [[Imus]] are officially known as the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 3rd Districts of Cavite, respectively.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cebu|Cebu]] (7){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Mandaue]] remains part of Cebu's congressional representation until 2022.}}\n* [[Legislative districts of Cotabato|Cotabato]] (3)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao de Oro|Davao de Oro]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao del Norte|Davao del Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative district of Davao Occidental|Davao Occidental]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao Oriental|Davao Oriental]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur|Davao del Sur]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Dinagat Islands|Dinagat Islands]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Eastern Samar|Eastern Samar]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Guimaras|Guimaras]] (1)\n* [[Legislative district of Ifugao|Ifugao]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of Ilocos Norte|Ilocos Norte]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Ilocos Sur|Ilocos Sur]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Iloilo|Iloilo]] (5)\n* [[Legislative districts of Isabela|Isabela]] (6){{efn|group=provinces|The independent city of [[Santiago (Philippine city)|Santiago]] remains part of Isabela's congressional representation.}}\n* [[Legislative district of Kalinga|Kalinga]] (1)\n* [[Legislative districts of La Union|La Union]] (2)\n* [[Legislative districts of Laguna|Laguna]] (4){{efn|group=provinces|The component cities of [[Bi\u00f1an]] and [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] are represented separately from Laguna, but remains as part of the province's 1st and 2nd Districts, respectively, for the purpose of electing [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] members.

representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}\nThe party-list system is the name designated for party-list representation. Under the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the electorate can vote for certain party-list organizations in order to give voice to significant minorities of society that would otherwise not be adequately represented through geographical district. From 1987\u20131998, party-list representatives were appointed by the President.\n\nSince 1998, each voter votes for a single party-list organization. Organizations that garner at least 2% of the total number of votes are awarded one representative for every 2% up to a maximum of three representatives. Thus, there can be at most 50 party-list representatives in Congress, though usually no more than 20 are elected because many organizations do not reach the required 2% minimum number of votes.\n\nAfter the [[2007 Philippine House of Representatives elections|2007 election]], in a controversial decision, the Supreme Court ordered the COMELEC to change how it allocates the party-list seats. Under the new formula only one party will have the maximum 3 seats. It based its decision on a formula contained in the ''VFP vs. COMELEC'' decision. In 2009, in the ''BANAT vs. COMELEC'' decision, it was changed anew in which parties with less than 2% of the vote were given seats to fulfill the 20% quota as set forth in the constitution.\n\nAside from determining which party won and allocating the number of seats won per party, another point of contention was whether the nominees should be a member of the marginalized group they are supposed to represent; in the ''Ang Bagong Bayani vs. COMELEC'' decision, the Supreme Court not only ruled that the nominees should be a member of the marginalized sector, but it also disallowed major political parties from participating in the party-list election. However, on the ''BANAT'' decision, the court ruled hat since the law didn't specify who belongs to a marginalized sector, the court allowed anyone to be a nominee as long as the nominee as a member of the ''party'' (not necessarily the marginalized group the party is supposed to represent).\n\n==Redistricting==\n[[File:Philippine congressional districts population.png|thumb|Population of each congressional district in the Philippines.

Therefore, apportionment often can be influenced by political motivations. Incumbent representatives who are not permitted by law to serve after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that their allies be able to run, while \"switching offices\" with them. Likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.\n\nSince 1987, the creation of some new congressional districts have been met with controversy, especially due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some of these new congressional districts are tied to the creation of a new province, because such an act necessarily entails the creation of a new congressional district.\n* '''Creation of [[Davao Occidental]], 2013:''' The rival Cagas and Bautista clans dominate politics in the province of [[Davao del Sur]]; their members have been elected as congressional representatives for the [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#1st District|first]] and [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#2nd District|second districts]] of the province since 1987.

The last nationwide apportionment act was the ordinance to the 1987 constitution, which was based on the 1980 census.]]\nBecause of the lack of a nationwide reapportionment after the publication of every census since the Constitution was promulgated in 1987, faster-growing provinces and cities have become severely underrepresented. Each legislative district is ideally supposed to encompass a population of 250,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/31/09/rp-popn-calls-350-congress-seats |title= RP pop'n calls for 350 Congress seats |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Powers==\nThe House of Representatives is modeled after the [[United States House of Representatives]]; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the House of Representatives, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the House of Representatives on third reading, the bill is passed to the Senate, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the Senate is different from the one passed by the House of Representatives, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.\n\nJust like most lower houses, [[money bill]]s, originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments, same with bills of local application and private bills. The House of Representatives has the sole power to initiate [[impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment]] proceedings, and may impeach an official by a vote of one-third of its members. Once an official is impeached, the Senate tries that official.\n\n==Seat==\n[[File:Taft Addressing First Philippine Assembly 1907.jpg|thumb|[[William Howard Taft]] addressing the [[1st Philippine Legislature]] at the [[Manila Grand Opera House]] in 1907.]]\n[[File:MansionHouseBaguio.jpg|thumb|The [[2nd Philippine Legislature]] convened at [[The Mansion, Baguio|The Mansion]] in [[Baguio]] in 1921.]]\n\nThe [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]] (National Legislature) at [[Quezon City]] is the seat of the House of Representatives since its restoration in 1987; it took its name from the [[Batasang Pambansa]], the national parliament which convened there from 1978 to 1986.\n\nThe [[Philippine Legislature]] was inaugurated at the [[Manila Grand Opera House]] at 1907, then it conducted business at the [[Ayuntamiento de Manila|Ayuntamiento in Intramuros]]. Governor-General [[Leonard Wood]] summoned the [[2nd Philippine Legislature]] at [[Baguio]] and convened at [[The Mansion, Baguio|The Mansion]] in [[Baguio]] for three weeks. The legislature returned to the Ayutamiento, as the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Legislative Building]] was being constructed; it first convened there on July 26, 1926. The House of Representatives continued to occupy the second floor until 1945 when the area was shelled during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]]. The building was damaged beyond repair and Congress convened at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Quezon Memorial Book|date=1952|publisher=Quezon Memorial Committee}}</ref> (modern-day S. H. Loyola) Street, Manila until the Legislative Building can be occupied again in 1949. Congress stayed at the Legislative Building, by now called the Congress Building, until President Marcos shut Congress and ruled by decree starting in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings_ancestral |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Ancestral Quarters |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\nMarcos then oversaw the construction of the new home of parliament at [[Quezon City]], which convened in 1978. The parliament, called the Batasang Pambansa continued to sit there until the passage of the [[Constitution of the Philippines#\"Freedom Constitution\" (1986)|1986 Freedom Constitution]]. The House of Representatives inherited the Batasang Pambansa Complex in 1987.\n\n===Batasang Pambansa Complex===\nThe Batasang Pambansa Complex, now officially called the House of Representatives Building Complex, is at the National Government Center, Constitution Hills, Quezon City. Accessible via [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]], the complex consists of four buildings. The Main Building hosts the session hall; the North and South wings, inaugurated in December 1977, are attached to it. The newest building, the Ramon Mitra, Jr. Building, was completed in 2001. It houses the Legislative Library, the Committee offices, the Reference and Research Bureau, and the Conference Rooms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Present Legislative Building |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>\n\n== Current composition ==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|18th Congress of the Philippines}}{{further|List of Philippine House of Representatives committees}}\nThe members of the House of Representatives, aside from being grouped into political parties, are also grouped into the \"majority bloc\", \"minority bloc\" and \"independents\" (different from the independent in the sense that they are not affiliated into a political party). Originally, members who voted for the winning Speaker belong to the majority and members who voted for the opponent are the minority. The majority and minority bloc are to elect amongst themselves a floor leader. While members are allowed to switch blocs, they must do so in writing. Also, the bloc where they intend to transfer shall accept their application through writing. When the bloc the member ought to transfer refuses to accept the transferring member, or a member does not want to be a member of either bloc, that member becomes an independent member. A member that transfers to a new bloc forfeits one's committee chairmanships and memberships, until the bloc the member transfers to elects the member to committees.\n\nThe membership in each committee should be in proportion to the size of each bloc, with each bloc deciding who amongst them who will go to each committee, upon a motion by the floor leader concerned to the House of Representatives in plenary. The Speaker, Deputy Speakers, floor leaders, deputy floor leaders and the chairperson of the Committee on Accounts can vote in committees; the committee chairperson can only vote to break a tie.\n\nTo ensure that the representatives each get their pork barrel, most of them will join the majority bloc, or even to the president's party, as basis of [[patronage politics]] (known as the [[Padrino System]] locally); thus, the House of Representatives always aligns itself with the party of the sitting president.\n\nThe majority bloc sits at the right side of the speaker, facing the House of Representatives.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" wikitable sortable style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n====District representatives====\n! width=\"120px\"| [[Province of the

Its operating system, NetWare 6.5 SP7, can run as a [[Paravirtualization|paravirtualized]] [[Hardware virtualization#Paravirtualization|guest]] inside the [[Xen]] [[hypervisor]].

Compulsory education includes six years of [[primary education]], typically starting at age six or seven, followed by three years of junior secondary education (junior middle school). Some provinces may have five years of primary school, but four years for junior middle school. After junior middle school, there are three years of senior middle school, which then completes [[secondary education]].\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Education reported an increase of 1.5611 million students entering into compulsory education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.moe.gov.cn/documents/reports/201910/t20191022_404775.html|title=Overview of educational achievements in China in 2018|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2019|website=Ministry of Education - The People's Republic of China|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1985, the government abolished tax-funded [[higher education]], requiring university applicants to compete for [[scholarship]]s based on academic ability.

Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more evident than in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986\u201390), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981\u201385). In 1986, 16.8 percent of the [[state budget]] was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intra-party realignments, official policy has alternated between [[Ideology|ideological]] imperatives and practical efforts to further national education, though the two have often been incompatible. {{how|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|reason=This is a bold claim to make without a citation.|date=March 2020}} The [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360) and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (1962\u201365) sought to end deeply rooted [[academic elitism]], to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of [[scholar]]s and [[intellectual]]s to disdain [[manual labor]]. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of [[social equality]] was an overriding priority.\n\n[[Image:Beijing-Mean-Value-Theorem-3733.jpg|thumb|A [[mean value theorem]] equation is displayed on a bridge in [[Beijing]].]]\nThe post-[[Mao Zedong]] [[Chinese Communist Party]] leadership views education as the foundation of the [[Four Modernizations]]. In the early 1980s, [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] education became an important focus of [[education policy]]. By 1986, training skilled personnel and expanding scientific and technical knowledge had been assigned the highest priority. Although the [[humanities]] were considered important, vocational and technical skills were considered paramount for meeting China's [[modernization]] goals. The reorientation of educational priorities paralleled [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s strategy for economic development. Emphasis also was placed on the further training of the already-educated elite, who would carry on the modernization program in the coming decades. A renewed emphasis on modern science and technology led to the adoption of an outward-looking policy that encouraged learning and borrowing from abroad for advanced training in a wide range of scientific fields, beginning in 1976.\n\nBeginning at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, intellectuals were encouraged to pursue [[research]] in support of the Four Modernizations and, as long as they complied with the party's \"[[Four Cardinal Principles]]\" they were given relatively free rein. However, when the party and the government determined that the structures of the four cardinal principles had been stretched beyond tolerable limits, they did not hesitate to restrict intellectual expression.\n\n[[Chinese literature|Literature]] and the [[Chinese art|arts]] also experienced a great revival in the late 1970s and 1980s. Traditional forms flourished once again, and many new kinds of literature and cultural expression were introduced from abroad.\n\nAs of 2015, the government-operated primary and lower secondary (junior high) schools in China have 28.8 million students.<ref name=HornbyReuterspointWest>Hornby, Lucy ([[Reuters]]). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=0 International Schools in China Point Students to the West] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722210045/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=0 |date=July 22, 2016 }}\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6bY5fQVia?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=1 Archive]).

Families must supplement money provided to the school by the government with tuition fees, which means that some children have much less. However, parents place a very high value on education and make great personal sacrifices to send their children to school and university. Illiteracy in the young and mid-aged population has fallen from over 80 percent down to five percent. The system trained some 60 million mid- or high-level professionals and near 400 million laborers to the junior or senior high school level. Today, 250 million Chinese get three levels of school education, (elementary, junior and senior high school) doubling the rate of increase in the rest of the world during the same period. Net elementary school enrollment has reached 98.9 percent, and the gross enrollment rate in junior high schools 94.1 percent.\n\nChina's educational horizons are expanding. In the 1980s, the [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] was virtually unknown but by 2004 there were 47,000 MBAs, trained at 62 MBA schools. Many people also apply for international professional qualifications, such as [[Master of Business Administration|EMBA]] and [[Master of Accountancy|MPA]]; close to 10,000 MPA students are enrolled in 47 schools of higher learning, including [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The education market has rocketed, with training and testing for professional qualifications, such as computer and foreign languages, thriving. [[Continuing education]] is the trend, once in one's life schooling has become [[lifelong learning]].\n\nInternational cooperation and education exchanges increase every year. China has more students studying abroad than any other country; since 1979, there have been 697,000 Chinese students studying in 103 countries and regions, of whom 185,000 have returned after finishing their studies. The number of foreign students studying in China has increased rapidly; in 2004, over 110,000 students from 178 countries were studying at China's universities.\n\nInvestment in education has increased in recent years; the proportion of the overall budget allocated to education has been increased by one percentage point every year since 1998. According to a [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] program, the government will set up an educational finance system in line with the [[public finance]] system, strengthen the responsibility of governments at all levels in educational investment, and ensure that their financial allocation for educational expenditure grows faster than their regular revenue. The program also set out the government's aim that educational investment should account for four percent of GDP in a relatively short period of time.\n\nFor non-compulsory education, China adopts a shared-cost mechanism, charging tuition at a certain percentage of the cost. Meanwhile, to ensure that students from low-income families have access to higher education, the government has initiated effective ways of assistance, with policies and measures as scholarships, work-study programs, subsidies for students with special economic difficulties, tuition reduction or exemption and state stipends.\n\nThe government has committed itself to markedly raising educational levels generally, as evidenced in a Ministry of Education program; by 2020, of every 100,000 people, 13,500 will have had a junior college education or above and some 31,000 will have had senior high school schooling; rates for illiteracy and semi-literacy rate will fall below three percent, and average schooling duration across the population will increase from today's eight years to nearly 11.\n\nIn the 2009 test of the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the best results in mathematics, science and reading.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon | title=In PISA Test, Top Scores From Shanghai Stun Experts | date=7 December 2010 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722210058/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html?_r=1 | archive-date=July 22, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"WSJ-4739574\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_PISA1206_20101207.html |title=2009 Program for International Student Assessment Scores |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=7 December 2010 |publisher=[[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |oclc=781541372 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-access=subscription |others=Source: National Center for Education Statistics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521033958/http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_PISA1206_20101207.html |archivedate=21 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The OECD also found that even in some of the very poor rural areas the performance is close to the OECD average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2010/12/new-data-shows-shanghais-rapid-rise-as-a-world-class-education-centre.html|title=New data shows Shanghai's rapid rise as a world-class education centre|publisher=Key Trends in Globalisation|author=John Ross|access-date=December 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063710/http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2010/12/new-data-shows-shanghais-rapid-rise-as-a-world-class-education-centre.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, controversy has surrounded the high scores achieved by the Chinese students due to the unusual spread of the numerical data, with suggestions that schools were 'gaming' students for the exams.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/on-those-stunning-shanghai-test-scores/67654/|title=On Those 'Stunning' Shanghai Test Scores|magazine=The Atlantic|author=James Fallows|date=|access-date=March 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221050732/http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/on-those-stunning-shanghai-test-scores/67654/|archive-date=December 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> While averages across the breadth of other countries are reported, China's rankings are taken from only a few select districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/china-cheats-the-pisa-exams/ |title=China 'Cheats' the PISA Exams |last1=Kubo |first1=Angela Erika |date=6 December 2013 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=6 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206032429/http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/china-cheats-the-pisa-exams/ |archive-date=December 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Education policy==\n{{See also|Education policy}}\nDeng Xiaoping's far-ranging educational reform policy, which involved all levels of the education system, aimed to narrow the gap between China and other developing countries. Thus, modernizing education was critical to modernizing China, which included; devolution of educational management from the central to the local level as the means chosen to improve the education system. Centralized authority was not abandoned, however, as evidenced by the creation of the State Education Commission. Academically, the goals of reform were to enhance and universalize elementary and junior middle school education; to increase the number of schools and qualified teachers, and to develop vocational and technical education. A uniform standard for [[curriculum|curricula]], textbooks, examinations, and teacher qualifications (especially at the middle-school level) was established, and considerable autonomy and variations in and among the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities were allowed.<ref>Teach In China, [http://www.teachinchina.cn/in-2018-china-gets-opportunity-to-teaching-english-in-abroad-existing-all-over-the-world/ In 2018, China Gets Opportunity to Teaching English In Abroad Existing All Over the World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318143719/http://www.teachinchina.cn/in-2018-china-gets-opportunity-to-teaching-english-in-abroad-existing-all-over-the-world/ |date=March 18, 2018 }}</ref> Further, the system of enrolment and job assignment in higher education was changed, and excessive government control over colleges and universities was reduced.

People's congresses at various local levels were, within certain guidelines and according to local conditions, to decide the steps, methods, and deadlines for implementing nine-year compulsory education in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the central authorities. The program sought to bring rural areas, which had four to six years of compulsory schooling, into line with their urban counterparts. Education departments were exhorted to train millions of skilled workers for all trades and professions and to offer guidelines, curricula, and methods to comply with the reform program and modernization needs.\n\n[[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Provincial-level]] authorities were to develop plans, enact decrees and rules, distribute funds to counties, and administer directly a few key [[secondary school]]s. County authorities were to distribute funds to each township government, which was to make up for any deficiencies. County authorities were to supervise education and teaching and to manage their own senior middle schools, teachers' schools, teachers' in-service training schools, agricultural vocational schools, and exemplary primary and junior middle schools. The remaining schools were to be managed separately by the county and township authorities.\n\nThe compulsory education law divided China into three categories: cities and economically developed areas in coastal provinces and a small number of developed areas in the hinterland; towns and villages with medium development; and economically backward areas.\n\nBy November 1985 the first category - the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990 cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, and a small number of developed interior areas (approximately 25 percent of China's population) and areas where junior middle schools were already popularized were targeted to have universal junior-middle-school education. Education planners had envisioned that by the mid-1990s all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or vocational education and that 5 percent of the people in these areas would have a college education - building a solid intellectual foundation for China. Further, the planners expected that secondary education and university entrants would have increased by the year 2000.\n\nThe second category targeted under the 9-year compulsory education law consisted of towns and villages with medium-level development (around 50 percent of China's population), where [[universal education]] was expected to reach the junior-middle-school level by 1995. Technical and higher education was projected to develop at the same rate.\n\nThe third category, economically backward (rural) areas (around 25 percent of China's population ) were to popularize [[basic education]] without a timetable and at various levels according to local economic development, though the state would try to support educational development. The state also would assist education in minority nationality areas. In the past, rural areas, which lacked a standardized and universal primary education system, had produced generations of illiterates; only 60 percent of their primary school graduates had met established standards.\n\nAs a further example of the government's commitment to nine-year compulsory education, in January 1986 the State Council drafted a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] passed at the Fourteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress that made it illegal for any organization or individual to employ youths before they had completed their nine years of schooling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/china/65.htm|title=China - THE EDUCATION SYSTEM|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The bill also authorized free education and subsidies for students whose families had financial difficulties.\n\nTuition-free primary education is, despite compulsory education laws, still a target rather than a realized goal throughout China. As many families have difficulty paying school fees, some children are forced to leave school earlier than the nine-year goal.\n\nThe 9-year System is called \"Nine Years - One Policy\", or \"\u4e5d\u5e74\u4e00\u8d2f\u5236\" in Chinese. It usually refers to the educational integration of the elementary school and the middle school. After graduating from elementary school, graduates can directly enter into the junior middle school. The grades in schools that implement the 9-year System are usually called Grade 1, Grade 2, and so on through Grade 9.\n\nMain features of the 9-year System:\n# Continuity. Students finish education from the elementary school to the middle school.\n# The principle of proximity. Students enter into the nearby school instead of middle school entrance examination.\n# Unity. Schools that carry out the 9-year System practice unified management in school administration, teaching and education.\n\n===Basic education===\nChina's basic education involves pre-school, nine-year [[compulsory education]] from [[elementary school|elementary]] to [[junior high school]], standard senior high school education, special education for disabled children, and education for illiterate people.\n\nChina has over 200 million elementary and high school students, who, together with pre-school children, account for one sixth of the total population. For this reason, the Central Government has prioritized basic education as a key field of infrastructure construction and educational development.\n\nIn recent years, senior high school education has developed steadily. In 2004 enrollment was 8.215 million, 2.3 times that of 1988. Gross national enrollment in senior high schools has reached 43.8 percent, still lower than that of other developed countries.\n\nThe government has created a special fund to improve conditions in China's elementary and high schools, for new construction, expansion and the re-building of run-down structures. Per-capita educational expenditure for elementary and high school students has grown greatly, teaching and research equipment, books and documents being updated and renewed every year.\n\nGovernment's aim for the development of China's basic education system is to approach or attain the level of moderately [[developed countries]] by 2010.\n\nGraduates of China's primary and secondary schools test highly in both basic skills and [[critical thinking]] skills;<ref name=\"NYT73016\">{{cite news|author1=Javier C.

Because educational resources were scarce, selected (\"key\") institutions \u2013 usually those with records of past educational accomplishment \u2013 were given priority in the assignment of teachers, equipment, and funds. They also were allowed to recruit the best students for special training to compete for admission to top schools at the next level. Key schools constituted only a small percentage of all regular senior middle schools and funneled the best students into the best secondary schools, largely on the basis of entrance scores. In 1980 the greatest resources were allocated to the key schools that would produce the greatest number of college entrants.\n\nIn early 1987, efforts had begun to develop the key school from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] into a vehicle for diffusing improved curricula, materials, and teaching practices in local schools. Moreover, the appropriateness of a key school's role in the nine-year basic education plan was questioned by some officials because key schools favored urban areas and the children of more affluent and better educated parents. [[Changchun]], [[Shenyang]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], and other cities, and education departments in [[Shanghai]] and [[Tianjin]] were moving to establish a student recommendation system and eliminate key schools. In 1986 the Shanghai Educational Bureau abolished the key junior-middle-school system to ensure \"an overall level of education.\" Despite the effort to abolish the \"Key Schools\" system, the practice still exists today under other names, and education inequality is still being widely criticized by some government officials and scholars.\n\n===Training schools===\n[[Training schools in China|Training schools]], also called Training Centers, are a type of [[private school|private education]] offered by private companies that help students in China, typically 3\u201312 years old, improve their performance in academic subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[mathematics|math]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Training schools can range anywhere from a one-room operation with only one teacher, to very large corporations with hundreds of thousands of students.\n\n==Primary education==\n===Primary schools===\nThe institution of primary education in a country as vast as China has been an impressive accomplishment. In contrast to the 20 percent enrollment rate before 1949, in 1985 about 96 percent of primary school age children were enrolled in approximately 832,300 primary schools. This enrollment figure compared favorably with the recorded figures of the late 1960s and early 1970s when enrollment standards were more egalitarian. In 1985, the [[World Bank]] estimated that enrollments in primary schools would decrease from 136 million in 1983 to 95 million in the late 1990s and that the decreased enrollment would reduce the number of teachers needed. Qualified teachers, however, would continue to be in demand.\n\nUnder the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, primary schools were to be tuition-free and reasonably located for the convenience of children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without the weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.\n\nChildren usually entered primary school at seven years of age for six days a week, which after regulatory changes in 1995 and 1997 were changed to five and a half and five days, respectively. The two-semester school year consisted of 9.5 months, and began on September 1 and March 1, with a summer vacation in July and August and a winter vacation in January and February. Urban primary schools typically divided the school week into twenty-four to twenty-seven classes of forty-five minutes each, but in the rural areas, the norm was half-day schooling, more flexible schedules, and itinerant teachers. Most primary schools had a five-year course, except in such cities as [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], and later other major cities, which had reintroduced six-year primary schools and accepted children at six and one-half years rather than seven.\n\nThe primary-school curriculum consisted of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], [[physical education]], [[music]], [[drawing]], and elementary instruction in [[nature]], [[history]], and [[geography]], combined with practical work experiences around the school compound. General knowledge of politics and moral training, which stressed the love of the motherland, love of the political party, and love of the people (and previously love of Chairman Mao), was another part of the curriculum. A foreign language, often [[English language|English]], is introduced in about the [[third grade]]. Chinese and mathematics accounted for about 60 percent of the scheduled class time; [[natural science]] and [[social science]] accounted for about 8 percent. [[Putonghua]] (commonly spoken language) was taught in regular schools and [[pinyin]] romanization in lower grades and kindergarten. The Ministry of Education required that all primary schools offer courses on [[morality]] and [[ethics]]. Beginning in the fourth grade, students usually had to perform productive labor two weeks per semester to relate classwork with production experience in workshops or on farms and relate it to academic study. Most schools had after-hour activities at least one day per week to involve students in recreation and community service.\n\nBy 1980 the percentage of students enrolled in primary schools were high, but the schools reported high [[dropping out|dropout]] rates and regional enrollment gaps (most enrollees were concentrated in the cities). Only one in four counties had universal primary education. On average, 10 percent of the students dropped out between each grade. During the 1979\u201383 period, the government acknowledged the \"9-6-3\" rule, that is, that nine of ten children began primary school, six completed it, and three graduated with good performance. This meant that only about 60 percent of primary students actually completed their five-year program of study and graduated, and only about 30 percent were regarded as having primary-level competence. Statistics in the mid-1980s showed that more rural girls than boys dropped out of school.\n\nWithin the framework of the ''Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education'' and the general trend toward vocational and technical skills, attempts were made to accommodate and correct the gap between urban and rural education. Urban and key schools almost invariably operated on a six-day full-time schedule to prepare students for further education and high-level jobs. Rural schools generally operated on a flexible schedule geared to the needs of the agricultural seasons and sought to prepare students for adult life and manual labor in lower-skilled jobs. They also offered a more limited curriculum, often only [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], and [[morality|morals]]. To promote attendance and allow the class schedule and academic year to be completed, agricultural seasons were taken into account. School holidays were moved, school days shortened, and full-time, half-time, and spare-time classes offered in the slack agricultural seasons. Sometimes itinerant teachers were hired for mountain villages and served one village in the morning, another village in the afternoon.\n\nRural parents were generally well aware that their children had limited opportunities to further their education. Some parents saw little use in having their children attend even primary school, especially after the establishment of the agricultural [[responsibility system]]. Under that system, parents preferred that their children work to increase family income - and withdrew them from school - for both long and short periods of time.\n\n===Preschool education===\n[[Preschool education]], which began at age three, was another target of education reform in 1985. Preschool facilities were to be established in buildings made available by public enterprises, [[production team (China)|production teams]], [[municipal authorities]], local groups, and families. The government announced that it depended on individual organizations to sponsor their own preschool education and that preschool education was to become a part of the welfare services of various government organizations, institutes, and state- and collectively operated enterprises. Costs for preschool education varied according to services rendered. Officials also called for more preschool teachers with more appropriate training.\n\n===Special education===\nThe 1985 National Conference on Education also recognized the importance of [[special education]], in the form of programs for [[gifted children]] and for slow learners. Gifted children were allowed to skip grades. Slow learners were encouraged to reach minimum standards, although those who did not maintain the pace seldom reached the next stage. For the most part, children with severe learning problems and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories. The China Welfare Fund, established in 1984, received state funding and had the right to solicit donations within China and from abroad, but special education has remained a low government priority.\n\nToday, China has 1,540 schools for special education, with 375,000 students; more than 1,000 vocational training institutes for disabled people, nearly 3,000 standard vocational training and education institutes that also admit disabled people; more than 1,700 training organizations for rehabilitating hearing-impaired children, with over 100,000 trained and in-training children. In 2004, 4,112 disabled students entered ordinary schools of higher learning. Of disabled children receiving special education, 63.6 percent of total recruitment numbers and 66.2 percent of enrollment were in ordinary schools or special classes thereof.\n\n==Secondary education==\n===History===\n[[File:5878-Linxia-High-School-admission-results-posted-outside-the-gate.jpg|thumb|Lists of newly admitted students - complete with their home communities, test scores, and any [[affirmative action|extra points]] they derived due to their [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnicity]] or [[One child policy|family size]] - posted outside of [[Linxia High School]]]]\nSecondary education in China has a complicated history. In the early 1960s, education planners followed a policy called \"walking on two legs,\" which established both regular academic schools and separate technical schools for vocational training. The rapid expansion of secondary education during the Cultural Revolution created serious problems; because resources were spread too thinly, educational quality declined. Further, this expansion was limited to regular secondary schools; technical schools were closed during the Cultural Revolution because they were viewed as an attempt to provide inferior education to children of worker and peasant families.\n\nIn the late 1970s, government and party representatives criticized what they termed the \"unitary\" approach of the 1960s, arguing that it ignored the need for two kinds of graduates: those with an academic education (college preparatory) and those with specialized technical education (vocational). Beginning in 1976 with the renewed emphasis on technical training, technical schools reopened, and their enrollments increased.\n\nIn the drive to spread vocational and technical education, regular secondary-school enrollments fell. By 1986 universal secondary education was part of the nine-year compulsory education law that made primary education (six years) and junior-middle-school education (three years) mandatory. The desire to consolidate existing schools and to improve the quality of key middle schools was, however, under the education reform, more important than expanding enrollment.\n\n===Junior secondary===\nJunior secondary education is more commonly known as (junior) middle school education, it consists the last three years of nine years compulsory education. Students who live in rural areas are often boarded into townships to receive their education.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation|last = Woodman|first = Dan|publisher = Sage|year = 2015|isbn = 9781446259054|location = Los Angeles|pages = 156|last2 = Wyn|first2 = Johanna}}</ref>\n\n===Senior secondary===\n[[File:SS Frontgate.JPG|220px|thumb| [[Guangdong Experimental High School]], one of the key high schools based in [[Guangzhou]], China. ]]\nSenior secondary education often refers to three years of [[high school]] (or called senior middle school) education, as from grade 10 to grade 12. Normally, students who have finished six years of primary education will continue three more years of academic study in middle schools as regulated by the [[Education in China#Compulsory education law|Compulsory education law]] at the age of twelve. This, however, is not compulsory for senior secondary education, where junior graduates may choose to continue a three-year academic education in academic high schools, which will eventually lead to university or to switch to a vocational course in vocational high schools.\n\nGenerally, high school years usually have two [[semester]]s, starting in September and February. In some rural areas, the operation may be subject to agricultural cycles. The number of lessons offered by a school every week is very subjective and largely depends on the school's resources. In addition to normal lessons, periods for private study and extracurricular activity are provided as well. The academic curriculum consists of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], [[Geography]], [[History]], [[Ideology]] & [[Political Science]], [[Music]], [[Fine Art]]s, [[Physical Education|PE]], [[Technology]], [[Computing]], etc. Some schools may also offer vocational subjects. Generally speaking, [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], and [[English language|English]] are considered as three main subjects as they will definitely be examined in [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|Gaokao]]. In most provinces, students also need to be examined in either natural sciences, which incorporate [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]], or social sciences, which incorporate [[Geography]], [[History]], and [[Ideology]] & [[Political Science]].\n\nIn China, a senior high school graduate will be considered as an educated person, although the majority of graduates will go on to universities or vocational colleges. Given that the competition for limited university places is extremely intense, most high schools are evaluated by their academic performance in [[Gaokao]] by parents and students.\n\n====Admissions and Zhongkao====\n{{main|Senior High School Entrance Examination}}\n'''Zhongkao''' (\u4e2d\u8003), the [[Senior High School Entrance Examination]], is the academic examination held annually in China to distinguish junior graduates. Generally speaking, students will be tested in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Political Science]] and [[Physical education|PE]]. However, the scoring system may change, and vary between different areas.\n\nAdmission for senior high schools, especially selective high schools, is somewhat similar to the one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.\n\nThere are other official rules of admission in certain top high schools. If a prestigious senior high school wants to admit 800 students a year, the admissions office ranks students\u2019 scores from highest to lowest and then selects their first 700 students. The other 100 positions are provided to the students who do not meet the required standard, but still want to study at that school. These prospects need to pay extra school fees. A student can't perform badly in Zhongkao, if their scores are close to the required standard, they could still study in that top school if they can afford the expenses. Those who study in that high school must place a maximum of two points below the standard requirement. Usually, 0.5 points is a standard. For instance, if a student is two points below the standard requirement, they pay four times as much as the student who gets 0.5 points below the standard requirement. The admissions of the 100 students who are required to pay the school fees usually do not get the same admission letters as normal students receive, but they can still study and live with normal students in the same high school, with the same teacher.\n\n====Vocational and technical schools====\nThe \"Law on Vocational Education\" was issued in 1996. [[Vocational education]] embraces higher vocational schools, secondary skill schools, vestibule schools, vocational high schools, job-finding centers and other adult skills and social training institutes. To enable vocational education to better accommodate the demands of economic re-structuring and urbanization, in recent years the government has remodeled vocational education, oriented towards obtaining employment and focusing on two major vocational education projects to meet society's ever more acute demand for high quality, skilled workers. These are cultivating skilled workers urgently needed in modern manufacturing and service industries; and training rural laborers moving to urban areas. To accelerate vocational education in western areas, the Central Government has used government bonds to build 186 vocational education centers in impoverished western area counties.\n\nBoth regular and vocational secondary schools sought to serve modernization needs. A number of technical and \"skilled-worker\" training schools reopened after the Cultural Revolution, and an effort was made to provide exposure to vocational subjects in general secondary schools (by offering courses in the industry, services, business, and agriculture). By 1985 there were almost 3 million vocational and technical students.\n\nUnder the educational reform tenets, [[polytechnic college]]s were to give priority to admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.\n\nAlthough enrollment in technical schools of various kinds had not yet increased enough to compensate for decreasing enrollments in regular senior middle schools, the proportion of vocational and technical students to total senior-middle-school students increased from about 5 percent in 1978 to almost 36 percent in 1985, although development was uneven. Further, to encourage greater numbers of junior-middle-school graduates to enter technical schools, vocational and technical school graduates were given priority in job assignments, while other job seekers had to take technical tests.\n\nIn 1987 there were four kinds of secondary vocational and technical schools:\n\n1. Technical schools, which offered a four-year, post-junior middle course and two- to three-year post-senior middle training in such fields as [[commerce]], [[Chinese law|legal work]], [[fine arts]], and [[forestry]];\n\n2. Workers' training schools, which accepted students whose senior-middle-school education consisted of two years of training in such trades as carpentry and welding;\n\n3. Vocational technical schools, which accepted either junior-or senior-middle-school students for one- to three-year courses in [[cooking]], [[tailoring]], [[photography]], and other services; and\n\n4. Agricultural middle schools, which offered basic subjects and [[agricultural science]].\n\nThese technical schools had several hundred different programs. Their narrow [[Academic specialization|specializations]] had advantages in that they offered in-depth training, reducing the need for on-the-job training and thereby lowering [[learning]] time and costs. Moreover, students were more motivated to study if there were links between training and future jobs. Much of the training could be done at existing [[Business|enterprises]], where staff and equipment was available at little additional cost.\n\nThere were some disadvantages to this system, however. Under the [[Four Modernizations]], technically trained generalists were needed more than highly specialized [[technician]]s. Also, highly specialized equipment and staff were underused, and there was an overall shortage of specialized facilities to conduct training. In addition, large expenses were incurred in providing the necessary facilities and staff, and the trend in some government technical agencies was toward more general technical and vocational education.\n\nFurther, the dropout rate continued to have a negative effect on the labor pool as upper-secondary-school technical students dropped out and as the percentage of lower-secondary-school graduates entering the labor market without job training increased. [[wikt:occupation|Occupational]] rigidity and the geographic im[[population mobility|mobility]] of the population, particularly in rural areas, further limited educational choices.\n\nAlthough there were 668,000 new polytechnic school enrollments in 1985, the Seventh Five-Year Plan called for annual increases of 2 million mid-level skilled workers and 400,000 senior technicians, indicating that enrollment levels were still far from sufficient. To improve the situation, in July 1986 officials from the State Education Commission, State Planning Commission, and Ministry of Labor and Personnel convened a national conference on developing China's technical and vocational education. It was decided that technical and vocational education in rural areas should accommodate local conditions and be conducted on a short-term basis. Where conditions permitted, the emphasis would be placed on organizing technical schools and short-term training classes. To alleviate the shortage of teachers, vocational and technical teachers' colleges were to be reformed and other colleges and universities were to be mobilized for assistance. The State Council decided to improve training for workers who had passed technical examinations (as opposed to unskilled workers) was intended to reinforce the development of vocational and technical schools.\n\nExpanding and improving secondary vocational education has long been an objective of China's educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation's expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained workforce, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, a pot of money for secondary schools, an allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education. Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over vocational secondary education which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public's perception is that these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China's modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question the policy that pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.\n\n==International education==\n[[File:ShanghaiAmericanSchoolPuxi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shanghai American School]] Puxi Campus]]\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group > Home|publisher=|access-date=January 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130003317/http://www.iscresearch.com/|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> listed China as having 481 international schools.<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group > Information > ISC News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\"<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\"/> This definition is used by publications including ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|work=The Economist|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215730/http://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> There were 177,400 students enrolled in international schools in 2014.<ref name=Geboominginternational>Ge, Celine. \"[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1855932/chinas-booming-international-school-business-untouched China's booming international school business untouched by slowdown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918032348/http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1855932/chinas-booming-international-school-business-untouched |date=September 18, 2015 }}.\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.

[[Postgraduate education]] is the fastest growing sector, with 24.1 percent more students recruited and 25.9 percent more [[researchers]] than the year before. This enrollment growth indicates that China has entered the stage of popular education. The [[UNESCO]] world higher education report of June 2003 pointed out that the student population of China's schools of higher learning had doubled in a very short time, and was the world's largest.\n\nParticular attention has been paid to improving systems in recent reforms. Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., [[automation]], [[nuclear power]], [[energy resources]], [[oceanography]], [[nuclear physics]], [[computer science]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[polymer physics]], [[radiochemistry]], [[physical chemistry]] and [[biophysics]]. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools of higher learning into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher learning has produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards. More than 30 universities have received help from a special national fund to support their attainment of the world elite class.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2003, enrollment in higher education increased from 1.6 million to 3.82 million. In 2004, the total enrollment in ordinary schools of higher learning was 4.473 million, 651,000 more than in 2003. Schools of higher learning and research institutes enrolled 326,000 postgraduate students, 57,000 more than the previous year. In 2010 China is expecting 6.3 million students to graduate from College or University, with 63% likely to enter the workforce.<ref>The China Perspective [http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinatoproduce63millioncollegegraduatesin20106518/index.html China to Produce 6.3 Million College Graduates in 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104103309/http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinatoproduce63millioncollegegraduatesin20106518/index.html |date=November 4, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe contribution to China's economic construction and social development made by research in the higher education sector is becoming ever more evident. By strengthening cooperation among their production, teaching and research, schools of higher learning are speeding up the process in turning sci-tech research results into products, giving rise to many new and hi-tech enterprises and important [[innovation]]s. Forty-three national university sci-tech parks have been started or approved, some of which have become important bases for commercializing research.\n\n===Background===\nThe quality of [[Higher education]] in modern China has changed at various times, reflecting shifts in the political policies implemented by the central government. Following the founding of the PRC, in 1949, the Chinese government's educational focus was largely on political \"[[Mind control|re-education]]\". In periods of political upheaval, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], ideology was stressed over professional or technical competence. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1969), tens of thousands of college students joined [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] organizations, which persecuted many university faculty members as \"counter-revolutionaries\" and effectively closed China's universities. When universities reopened in the early 1970s, enrollments were reduced from pre-Cultural Revolution levels, and admission was restricted to individuals who had been recommended by their [[work unit]] (''danwei''), possessed good political credentials, and had distinguished themselves in [[manual labor]]. In the absence of stringent and reasonably objective entrance examinations, political connections became increasingly important in securing the recommendations and political dossiers necessary to qualify for university admission. As a result, the decline in educational quality was profound. [[Deng Xiaoping]] reportedly wrote Mao Zedong in 1975 that university graduates were \"not even capable of reading a book\" in their own fields when they left the university. University faculty and administrators were demoralized by the political aspects of the university system.\n\nEfforts made in 1975 to improve educational quality were unsuccessful. By 1980 it appeared doubtful that the politically oriented admission criteria had accomplished even the purpose of increasing enrollment of workers and peasant children. Successful candidates for university entrance were usually children of cadres and officials who used personal connections that allowed them to \"enter through the back door.\" Students from officials' families would accept the requisite minimum two-year work assignment in the countryside, often in a suburban location that allowed them to remain close to their families. Village cadres, anxious to please the parents/officials, gladly recommended these youths for university placement after the labor requirement had been met. The child of an official family was then on his or her way to a university without having academic ability, a record of political activism, or a distinguished work record.\n\nAfter the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, steps were taken to improve educational quality by establishing order and stability, calling for an end to political contention on university campuses, and expanding university enrollments. This pressure to maintain quality and minimize [[expenditure]]s led to efforts both to run existing institutions more efficiently and to develop other college and university programs. As a result, labor colleges for training agro-technicians and factory-run colleges for providing technical education for workers were established. In addition, eighty-eight institutions and key universities were provided with special funding, top students and faculty members, and other support, and they recruited the most academically qualified students without regard to family background or political activism.\n\n===Modernization goals in the 1980s===\n[[File:VM 5489 Xian Station plaza.jpg|thumb|Representatives of [[Xi'an]] universities ready to welcome new students at booths set up outside of the city's train station throughout the late summer]]\nThe commitment to the [[Four Modernizations]] required great advances in science and technology. Under the [[modernization]] program, higher education was to be the cornerstone for [[training]] and [[research]]. Because modernization depended on a vastly increased and improved capability to train [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s for needed breakthroughs, the renewed concern for higher education and academic quality - and the central role that the sciences were expected to play in the Four Modernizations - highlighted the need for scientific research and training. This concern can be traced to the critical [[personnel]] shortages and qualitative deficiencies in the sciences resulting from the unproductive years of the Cultural Revolution when higher education was shut down. In response to the need for scientific training, the Sixth Plenum of the Twelfth National Party Congress Central Committee, held in September 1986, adopted a resolution on the guiding principles for building a [[socialist]] society that strongly emphasized the importance of [[education]] and [[science]].\n\nReformers realized, however, that the higher education system was far from meeting modernization goals and that additional changes were needed. The Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Institutions of Higher Learning, promulgated by the State Council in 1986, initiated vast changes in administration and adjusted educational opportunity, direction, and content. With the increased independence accorded under the education reform, universities and colleges were able to choose their own teaching plans and curricula; to accept projects from or cooperate with other socialist establishments for scientific research and technical development in setting up \"combines\" involving teaching, scientific research, and production; to suggest appointments and removals of vice presidents and other staff members; to take charge of the distribution of [[Fixed capital|capital]] construction investment and funds allocated by the state; and to be responsible for the development of international exchanges by using their own funds.\n\nThe changes also allowed the universities to accept financial aid from work units and decide how this money was to be used without asking for more money from departments in charge of education. Further, higher education institutions and work units could sign contracts for the training of students.\n\nHigher education institutions also were assigned a greater role in running inter-regional and inter-departmental schools. Within their state-approved [[budget]]s, universities secured more freedom to allocate funds as they saw fit and to use the income from [[tuition]] and technical and advisory services for their own development, including collective welfare and bonuses.\n\nThere also was a renewed interest in television, radio, and correspondence classes (see [[distance learning]] and [[electronic learning]]). Some of the courses, particularly in the college-run factories, were serious, full-time enterprises, with a two- to three-year [[curriculum]].\n\n====Entrance examinations and admission criteria====\n{{main|National Higher Education Entrance Examination}}\n\nNational examinations to select students for higher education (and positions of leadership) were an important part of [[Culture of China|China's culture]], and, traditionally, entrance to a higher education institution is considered prestigious. Although the [[examination system]] for admission to colleges and universities has undergone many changes since the Cultural Revolution, it remains the basis for recruiting academically able students. When higher education institutions were reopened in the early 1970s, candidates for entrance examinations had to be senior-middle-school graduates or the equivalent, generally below twenty-six years of age. Work experience requirements were eliminated, but workers and staff members needed permission from their enterprises to take the examinations.\n\nEach provincial-level unit was assigned a quota of students to be admitted to key universities, the second quota of students for regular universities within that administrative division, and a third quota of students from other provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities who would be admitted to institutions operated at the provincial level. Provincial-level administrative units selected students with outstanding records to take the examinations. Additionally, preselection examinations were organized by the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities for potential students (from three to five times the number of places allotted). These candidates were actively encouraged to take the examination to ensure that a sufficient number of good applicants would be available. [[Professional revolutionaries|Cadres]] with at least two years of work experience were recruited for selected departments in a small number of universities on an experimental basis. Preferential admission treatment (in spite of lower test scores) was given to minority candidates, students from disadvantaged areas, and those who agreed in advance to work in less developed regions after graduation.\n\nIn December 1977, when uniform national examinations were reinstated, 5.7 million students took the examinations, although university placement was available for only the 278,000 applicants with the highest scores. In July 1984, about 1.6 million candidates (30,000 fewer than in 1983) took the entrance examinations for the 430,000 places in China's more than 900 colleges and universities. Of the 1.6 million examinees, more than 1 million took the test for placement in [[science]] and [[engineering]] colleges; 415,000 for places in [[liberal arts]] colleges; 88,000 for placement in [[foreign language]] institutions; and 15,000 for placement in [[sports]] universities and schools. More than 100,000 of the candidates were from national minority groups. A year later, there were approximately 1.8 million students taking the three-day college entrance examination to compete for 560,000 places. Liberal arts candidates were tested on [[politics]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], [[foreign languages]], [[history]], and [[geography]]. Science and engineering candidates were tested on politics, Chinese, mathematics, [[chemistry]], and [[biology]]. Entrance examinations also were given in 1985 for professional and technical schools, which sought to enroll 550,000 new students.\n\nOther [[innovation]]s in enrollment practices, included allowing colleges and universities to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to try an experimental student recommendation system - fixed at 2 percent of the total enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for [[teachers' college]]s - instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.\n\nIn addition to the written examination, university applicants had to pass a physical examination and a political screening. Less than 2 percent of the students who passed the written test were eliminated for reasons of poor health. The number disqualified for political reasons was known, but publicly the party maintained that the number was very small and that it sought to ensure that only the most able students actually entered colleges and universities.\n\nBy 1985 the number of institutions of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]] issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.\n\nIn 1985 state quotas for university places were set, allowing both for students sponsored by institutions and for those paying their own expenses. This policy was a change from the previous system in which all students were enrolled according to guidelines established in Beijing. All students except those at military school or police academy, those who had financial difficulties, and those who were to work under adverse conditions after graduation had to pay for their own tuition, accommodations, and miscellaneous [[expenses]].\n\n====Changes in enrollment and assignment policies====\nThe children enrollment and graduate assignment system also were changed to reflect more closely the personnel needs of [[modernization]]. By 1986 the state was responsible for drafting the enrollment plan, which took into account future personnel demands, the need to recruit students from outlying regions and the needs of trades and professions with adverse working conditions. Moreover, a certain number of graduates to be trained for the [[People's Liberation Army]] were included in the state enrollment plan. In most cases, enrollment in higher education institutions at the employers' request was extended as a supplement to the state student enrollment plan. Employers were to pay a percentage of training fees, and students were to fulfill [[contract]]ual obligations to the employers after graduation. The small number of students who attended colleges and universities at their own expense could be enrolled in addition to those in the state plan.\n\nAccompanying the changes in enrollment practices were reforms (adopted 1986) in the faculty appointment system, which ended the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\" employment system and permitted colleges and universities to decide which [[academic department]]s, which [[academic major]]s, and how many teachers they needed. Teachers in institutions of higher learning were hired on a basis, usually for two to four years at a time. The teaching positions available on basis were [[teaching assistant]], [[lecturer]], [[associate professor]], and [[professor]]. The system was tested in eight major universities in Beijing and Shanghai before it was instituted nationwide at the end of 1985. University presidents headed groups in charge of appointing professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants according to their academic levels and teaching abilities, and a more rational wage system, geared to different job levels, was inaugurated. Universities and colleges with surplus professors and researchers were advised to grant them appropriate academic titles and encourage them to work for their current pay in schools of higher learning where they were needed. The new system was to be extended to schools of all kinds and other education departments within two years.\n\nUnder the 1985 reforms, all graduates were assigned jobs by the state; a central government placement agency told the schools where to send graduates. By 1985 [[Tsinghua University]] and a few other universities were experimenting with a system that allowed graduates to accept job offers or to look for their own positions. For example, of 1,900 Tsinghua University graduates in 1985, 1,200 went on to graduate school, 48 looked for their own jobs, and the remainder were assigned jobs by the school after consultation with the students. The college students and [[postgraduate]]s scheduled to graduate in 1986 were assigned primarily to work in [[forestry]], [[education]], [[textiles]], and the [[armaments]] industry. Graduates still were needed in [[civil engineering]], [[computer science]], and [[finance]].\n\n====Scholarship and loan system====\nIn July 1986 the State Council announced that the [[stipend]] system for [[university]] and [[college]] students would be replaced with a new scholarship and loan system. The new system, to be tested in selected institutions during the 1986\u201387 academic year, was designed to help students who could not cover their own living expenses but who studied hard, obeyed state laws, and observed [[discipline]] codes. Students eligible for financial aid were to apply to the schools and the [[China Industrial and Commercial Bank]] for low-[[interest]] [[loan]]s. Three categories of students eligible for aid were established: top students encouraged to attain all-around [[excellence]]; students specializing in [[education]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[sports]], and [[marine navigation]]; and students willing to work in poor, remote, and border regions or under harsh conditions, such as in [[mining]] and [[engineering]]. In addition, free tuition and board were to be offered at military school, and the graduates were required to join the army for at least five years in relevant positions. For those who worked in an approved rural position after graduation, student's loans would be paid off by his or her employer, such as a school, in a [[lump sum]]. And the money was to be repaid to the employer by the student through five years of [[payroll]] deductions.\n\n====Study Abroad====\nIn addition to loans, another means of raising educational quality, particularly in [[science]], was to send students abroad to study. A large number of Chinese students studied in the [[Soviet Union]] before educational links and other cooperative programs with the Soviet Union were severed in the late 1950s (see [[Sino-Soviet split]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, China continued to send a small number of students abroad, primarily to [[Europe]]an universities. In October 1978 Chinese students began to arrive in the [[United States]]; their numbers accelerated after normalization of relations between the two countries in January 1979, a policy consistent with [[modernization]] needs. Although figures vary, more than 36,000 students, including 7,000 self-supporting students (those who paid their own way, received [[scholarship]]s from host institutions, or received help from relatives and \"foreign friends\"), studied in 14 countries between 1978 and 1984. Of this total, 78 percent were technical personnel sent abroad for [[advanced study]]. As of mid-1986, there were 15,000 Chinese scholars and graduates in American universities, compared with a total of 19,000 scholars sent between 1979 and 1983.\n\nChinese students sent to the United States generally were not typical undergraduates or graduate students but were mid-career scientists, often thirty-five to forty-five years of age, seeking advanced training in their areas of [[Academic specialization|specialization]]. Often they were individuals of exceptional ability who occupied responsible positions in Chinese universities and research institutions. Fewer than 15 percent of the earliest arrivals were degree candidates. Nearly all the visiting scholars were in scientific fields.\n\n===Educational investment===\nMany of the problems that had hindered higher educational development in the past continued in 1987. Funding remained a major problem because [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] study and research and study abroad were expensive. Because education was competing with other [[modernization]] programs, the capital was critically short. Another concern was whether or not the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]] was sufficiently advanced to make efficient use of the highly trained technical personnel it planned to educate. For example, some observers believed that it would be more realistic to train a [[literate]] work force of low-level technicians instead of research scientists. Moreover, it was feared that using an examination to recruit the most able students might advance people who were merely good at taking examinations. Educational reforms also made some people uncomfortable by criticizing the traditional practice of rote memorization and promoting innovative teaching and study methods.\n\nThe prestige associated with higher education caused a demand for it. But many qualified youths were unable to attend colleges and universities because China could not finance enough university places for them. To help meet the demand and to educate a highly trained, specialized work force, China established alternate forms of higher education - such as spare-time, part-time, and radio and television universities.\n\nChina could not afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the education of a few students. Since 1978 China's leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party's principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China's leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to [[siphon]] off more than its share of funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.\n\nFamilies have had to cover for government indifference by making personal investments in their children's education. However, the Chinese economy may not be able to effectively absorb the resulting influx of college graduates, who may need to settle for lower paying jobs, if they can find those.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/in-china-families-bet-it-all-on-a-child-in-college.html|title=In China, Families Bet It All on College for Their Children|date=17 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414043237/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/in-china-families-bet-it-all-on-a-child-in-college.html|archive-date=April 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Reform in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Ant Tribe|label 1=Graduate underemployment in China}}\nIn 1998 the Chinese government proposed to expand the university enrollment of professional and specialized graduates and to develop world-class universities. Restructuring, through consolidations, mergers, and shifts among the authorities which supervise institutions, was aimed at addressing the problems of small size and low efficiency. Higher [[vocational education]] was also restructured, and there was a general tendency there to emphasize elite institutions. This rapid expansion of mass higher education has resulted in not only a strain in teaching resources, but also higher [[unemployment]] rates among graduates. The creation of private universities, not under governmental control, remains slow and its future uncertain. The restructuring of higher education, in the words of one academic \"has created a clearly escalating [[social stratification]] pattern among institutions, stratified by geography, source of funding, administrative unit, as well as by functional category (e.g., comprehensive, law, medical, etc.).\"<ref>Jin Xiao, \"China's Educational Reform in Transition: Is it Transforming?\" Chinese University of Hong Kong, unpublished paper, 2007.</ref> Thus, although recent reform has arguably improved over-all educational quality, they have created new, different issues of [[Equality of opportunity|equity]] and efficiency that will need to be addressed as the century proceeds.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities. The results of this evaluation are used to support the next major planned policy initiative. The last substantial national evaluation of universities, which was undertaken in 1994, resulted in the 'massification' of higher education as well as a renewed emphasis on elite institutions.<ref>Rui Yang, \"Chapter 8.

Since Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University started independent enrollment before College Entrance Examination in 2007, some of the top Chinese colleges began to follow them using a new method to choose students besides a unified examination system. In accordance with university regulations, those colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students. Students can get admitted by taking a specific exam or interview before the College Entrance Examination. In this way, students have more chances to get admitted by the top colleges. In 2010, there were several critical reforms in the education field. In January 31, the education ministry in Guangdong province began to implement parallel voluntary admission in the college entrance recruiting system, which is an efficient way to decrease the risk of getting into a college for the majority of students. In November 20, the education ministry of China cancelled the additional Olympics points in the College Entrance Exam policy. It is fairer for the high school students, and efficiently reduces the heavy academic burdens for students.\nAs the economic development of China, the private school system has been gradually built up. Many private preschools began to use bilingual teaching. Furthermore, some public colleges and universities cooperated with investors to run secondary college by using public running and being sponsored by private enterprises, which promotes the development of education. On the other hand, the Technical and Vocational Education in China has developed rapidly, and become the focus of the whole society.\n\n[[File:Bixi in Harvard University - IMG 8963.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard University|Harvard]] degrees have long been respected in China.

Instead, having a degree of an ordinary Chinese university already can't satisfy the increasingly competitive society.

In the 1960s, the idea of \"lifelong education\" was raised, and began the transition of Chinese education.<ref name=\":2\" /> Adult education begins focusing on the cultivation of social responsibility to develop lifelong education theory.\n\n==Teachers==\nIn 1985, the government designated September 10 as [[Teachers' Day]], the first festival day for any profession and indicative of government efforts to raise the social status and living standards of teachers.\n\nThe government has started the Nationwide Program of Network for Education of Teachers to improve the quality of teaching.{{When|date=March 2020}} It aims to modernize teachers' education through educational information, providing support and services for [[lifelong learning]] through the teachers' education network, TV satellite network, and the Internet and to greatly improve the teaching quality of elementary and high school faculty through large-scale, high-quality and high-efficiency training and continuous education.\n\nAs required by state law, local governments are implementing teacher qualification systems and promoting in-service training for large numbers of school principals, so as to further improve school management standards. Currently, in schools of higher learning, professors and assistant professors account for 9.5 percent and 30 percent respectively. Young and middle-aged teachers predominate; teachers under age 45 account for 79 percent of total faculty, and under age 35 for 46 percent. Teachers in higher education constitute a vital contingent in [[scientific research]], knowledge innovation and sci-tech. Of all academicians in the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], 40.7 percent (280) are in the higher education sector; for the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]] the corresponding figure is 35.3 percent (234).\n\nAmong the most pressing problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified [[teacher]]s, which has led to a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked [[professional training]]. Estimates indicated that in order to meet the goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million new teachers for primary schools, 750,000 new teachers for junior middle schools, and 300,000 new teachers for senior middle schools. Estimates predict, however, that the demand for teachers will drop in the late 1990s because of an anticipated decrease in primary-school [[education|enrollments]].\n\nTo cope with the shortage of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 percent of the time to subject teaching, 6 percent to [[pedagogy]] and [[psychology]], and 10 percent to [[teaching methods]]. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula were devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.\n\nBy 1985 there were more than 1,000 teacher training schools - an indispensable tool in the effort to solve the acute shortage of qualified teachers. These schools, however, were unable to supply the number of teachers needed to attain [[modernization]] goals through 1990. Although a considerable number of students graduated as qualified teachers from institutions of [[Higher Learning]], the relatively low social status and salary levels of teachers hampered recruitment, and not all of the graduates of teachers' colleges became teachers. To attract more teachers, China tried to make teaching a more desirable and respected profession. To this end, the government designated September 10 as [[Teachers' Day]], granted teachers pay raises, and made teachers' colleges tuition free. To further arrest the teacher shortage, in 1986 the central government sent teachers to underdeveloped regions to train local schoolteachers.\n\nBecause urban teachers continued to earn more than their rural counterparts and because academic standards in the countryside had dropped, it remained difficult to recruit teachers for rural areas. Teachers in rural areas also had production responsibilities for their plots of land, which took time from their teaching. Rural primary teachers needed to supplement their pay by farming because most were paid by the relatively poor local communities rather than by the state.\n\n==Adult and online education==\n{{See also|Adult education|Continuing education|Distance education|Lifelong learning}}\nThe participation of big investors in [[online education]] has made it a new hotspot for investment in the education industry. Students of remote and under-developed areas are the biggest beneficiaries of online education, but online universities offer students who failed [[National College Entrance Examination|university entrance examinations]] and working people the chance of lifelong education and learning.\n\nThe Ministry of Education has approved 68 ordinary schools of higher learning and the Central Radio and TV University to pilot modern distance education. By the end of 2003, these schools had established 2,027 off-campus learning centers around China, offering 140 majors in ten disciplines, and had a total enrollment of 1.373 million.\n\nThe gradual spread of broadband technology has also helped online education. The [[China Education and Research Network]] (CERNET), started in 1994, is now China's second largest Internet network, covering all major cities of China. The high-speed connection between it and the China Education Broadband Satellite Net opened in 2000, established a \"space to earth\" transmission platform for modern distance education, and provided an all-round network supporting environment for distance education.\n\nAdult education is both dynamic and diverse. Schools of higher learning for adults include radio and TV, worker, farmer, correspondence and evening universities, management and education colleges; adult secondary schools include vocational, high and skills training schools; worker elementary and farmer elementary schools comprise the adult elementary sector.\n\n===Role in modernization===\nBecause only 4 percent of the nation's secondary education graduates are admitted to universities, China has found it necessary to develop other ways of meeting the demand for education. [[Adult education]] has become increasingly important in helping China meet its [[modernization]] goals. Adult, or \"nonformal,\" education is an alternative form of higher education that encompasses [[radio]], [[television]], and [[correspondence education|correspondence]] universities, spare-time and part-time universities, [[factory]]-run universities for staff and workers, and county-run universities for peasants, many operating primarily during students' off-work hours. These alternative forms of education are economical. They had sought to educate both the \"delayed generation\" - those who lost educational opportunities during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376) - and to raise the cultural, scientific, and general education levels of workers on the job.\n\n===Forms===\nSchools have been established by government departments, businesses, trade unions, academic societies, democratic parties, and other organizations. In 1984 about 70 percent of China's factories and enterprises supported their own part-time classes, which often were referred to as workers' colleges. In Beijing alone, more than ninety adult-education schools with night schools enrolled tens of thousands of students. More than 20,000 of these students graduated annually from evening universities, workers' colleges, television universities, and correspondence schools - more than twice the number graduating from regular colleges and universities. The government spent 200 [[Renminbi|yuan]] (\u00a5) to \u00a5500 per adult education student and at least \u00a51,000 per regular university student. In 1984 approximately 1.3 million students enrolled in television, correspondence, and evening universities, about a 30 percent increase over 1983.\n\nSpare-time education for workers and peasants and [[literacy]] classes for the entire adult population were other components of [[basic education]]. Spare-time education included a very broad range of educational activities at all levels. Most spare-time schools were sponsored by factories and run for their own workers; they provided fairly [[elementary education]], as well as courses to upgrade technical skills. Most were on-the-job training and retraining courses, a normal part of any industrial system. These schools continually received publicity in the [[mass media|domestic media]] as a symbol of [[social justice]], but it was unclear whether they received adequate resources to achieve this end.\n\nChina's educational television system began in 1960 but was suspended during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In 1979 the [[Central Radio and Television University]] was established in Beijing with branches in twenty-eight provincial-level universities. Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the cut-off point for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years' work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal [[wage]]s; expenses for most of their books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours of [[homework]] each evening. The major problem with the system is that there were too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted and financed by the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]]. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. The curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities. The state gave certain allowances to students awaiting jobs during their training period.\n\n===Literacy and language reform===\n[[File:Dajia-shuo-Putonghua-2817.jpg|thumb|The [[Hanyu Pinyin]] Romanization is commonly used as a means of teaching literacy and the standard (\"Putonghua\") pronunciation]]\nThe continuing campaigns to eradicate illiteracy also were a part of [[basic education]]. Chinese government statistics indicated that of a total population of nearly 1.1 billion in 1985, about 230 million people were illiterate or semiliterate. The difficulty of mastering [[written Chinese]] makes raising the [[literacy]] rate particularly difficult. In general, language reform was intended to make writing and the [[Standard Chinese|standard language]] easier to learn, which in turn would foster both literacy and linguistic unity and serve as a foundation for a simpler written language. In 1951 the party issued a directive that inaugurated a three-part plan for language reform. The plan sought to establish universal comprehension of a standardized common language, simplify written characters, and introduce, where possible, romanized forms based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. In 1956 [[Putonghua]] ([[Modern Standard Chinese]]) was introduced as the language of instruction in schools and in the national broadcast media, and by 1977 it was in use throughout China, particularly in the government and party, and in education. Although in 1987 the government continued to endorse the goal of universalizing putonghua, hundreds of regional and local dialects continued to be spoken, complicating interregional communication.\n\nA second language reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes are easier to learn. In 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 [[simplified characters]] most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2011}}, although some people (especially in Hong Kong which is still using traditional Chinese) taught only in simplified characters were cut off from the wealth of [[Chinese literature]] written in [[traditional characters]]. Any idea of replacing the ideographic script with the romanized script was soon abandoned, however by government and education leaders.\n\nThe third area of change involved the proposal to use the [[pinyin]] romanization system more widely. Pinyin (first approved by the [[National People's Congress]] in 1958) was encouraged primarily to facilitate the spread of putonghua in regions where other dialects and languages are spoken. By the mid-1980s, however, the use of pinyin was not as widespread as the use of putonghua.\n\nRetaining literacy was as much a problem as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976. Political disorder may have contributed to the decline, but the basic problem was that the many Chinese ideographs can be mastered only through rote learning and can be often forgotten because of disuse.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n== Information and communications technology (ICT) ==\nIn 2010, the Government of China released its medium and long term national [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in education master plans, which stated explicitly that ICT would have a historic impact on the development of education and called for a strong emphasis on [[Educational technology|ICT in education]]. In order to realize the scientific and orderly development of ICT in education, China has developed a holistic and top-down approach. The Ten Year Development Plan for ICT in Education 2011-2020 was formalized in 2012. It states that by 2020, all adults will have access to quality education resources in an ICT-enabling environment, an ICT support service system for the learning society will take shape, and all regions and schools at all levels will have broadband internet access.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002430/243076e.pdf|title=Leveraging information and communication technologies to achieve the Post-2015 Education goal: report of the International Conference on ICT and Post-2015 Education|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=11\u201312|access-date=May 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215123717/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002430/243076E.pdf|archive-date=December 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn order to considerably enhance Internet coverage and transmission capacity, China has accelerated its drive to upgrade infrastructure, including the China Education and Research Network (CERNet) and China Education Broadband Satellite (CEBSat), which are the two main education networks.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nTo enhance the impact of ICT in education and teaching, China has placed a strong focus on developing quality digital educational resources.

A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities is one of the main culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me.</blockquote> In ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are \"shortchanged\" in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/in-chinese-schools-disabled-get-shortchanged.html?_r=0 |title=In Chinese Schools, Disabled Get Shortchanged |last=Farrar |first=Lara |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209010302/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/in-chinese-schools-disabled-get-shortchanged.html?_r=0 |archive-date=February 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== School uniforms ==\nMany schools in China require the use of a school uniform until college.<ref name=\"UniformDesign2011\">{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Miao|last2=He|first2=Xin|date=2 September 2011|title=Design and Development of Chinese Primary and Secondary New Type School Uniform|journal=Advanced Materials Research|volume=331|pages=679\u2013682|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.331.679|issn=1662-8985}}</ref> Students have uniforms for both sportswear and their daily uniform, both of which will change depending on the season.<ref name=\"UniformDesign2011\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/07/class-acts/|title=Class Act|last=Dawson|first=David|date=17 July 2017|website=The World of Chinese|access-date=October 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030002548/http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/07/class-acts/|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Uniforms can also differ in design depending on the school, making it easy for people to identify which school a student attends.<ref name=\"edu.gog.cn\" /> Proponents of school uniforms argue that the uniforms are a unique form of culture, remove the pressure of students comparing clothing, and allow the faculty and others to identify students and their respective schools.<ref name=\"edu.gog.cn\">{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gog.cn/system/2016/10/13/015161532.shtml|title=\u5b66\u6821\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u6c42\u5b66\u751f\u7a7f\u6821\u670d\uff0c\u539f\u6765\u4f5c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a!|website=edu.gog.cn|access-date=2018-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028225805/http://edu.gog.cn/system/2016/10/13/015161532.shtml|archive-date=October 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In an article for ''[[China Daily]]'', Yuan Can states that while student uniforms were previously regarded as a sign of progress, in current society the uniform's style is seen as more important by many students than a sense of identity and belonging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0430/c98649-8886161.html|title=Evolution of school uniforms in China|last1=Can|first1=Yuan|date=|website=People's Daily Online|accessdate=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115193931/http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0430/c98649-8886161.html|archive-date=November 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Rural education==\n{{see also|Rural boarding schools in China|Hukou system}}\nReflecting the fact that most of China's population lives in the countryside, 95.2 percent of all elementary schools, 87.6 percent of junior high schools and 71.5 percent of senior high schools are in rural areas, with 160 million students at the compulsory education stage. The 1995-2000 \"National Project of Compulsory Education in Impoverished Areas\" involved the allocation of 3.9 billion special funds from the central finance and 10 billion yuan raised by local governments to improve schooling conditions in impoverished areas. In 2004, various special funds allocated by the central finance for compulsory education in rural areas reached 10 billion yuan, a 72.4 percent increase on the 2003 figure of 5.8 billion.\n\nThe [[China Agricultural Broadcast and Television School]] has nearly 3,000 branch schools and a teaching and administrative staff of 46,000. Using radio, television, satellite, network, audio and video materials, it has trained over 100 million people in applicable agricultural technologies and over 8 million persons for work in rural areas. After 20 years in development, it is the world's largest [[distance learning]] organ for rural education.\n\nIn a Ministry of Education program covering the next five years {{Clarify timeframe|date=March 2020}}, the government will implement measures to realize its aims of nine-year compulsory education in China's western region and the basic elimination of young and middle-aged illiteracy and the popularization of high level, high quality nine-year compulsory education in the east and central rural areas.

Providing an alternative, private entrepreneurs established since the 1990s semi-official private schools that offered schooling to migrant children for lower fees. However, this system contributed to the segregation between urban and migrant children. Furthermore, these schools often have a poor teaching quality, provide only school certificates of limited value and sometimes even do not comply with safety regulations.<ref>Goodburn, C (2009): Learning from Migrant Education: A case study of the schooling of rural migrant children in Beijing.

Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more evident than in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986\u201390), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981\u201385). In 1986, 16.8 percent of the [[state budget]] was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intra-party realignments, official policy has alternated between [[Ideology|ideological]] imperatives and practical efforts to further national education, though the two have often been incompatible. {{how|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|reason=This is a bold claim to make without a citation.|date=March 2020}} The [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360) and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (1962\u201365) sought to end deeply rooted [[academic elitism]], to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of [[scholar]]s and [[intellectual]]s to disdain [[manual labor]]. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of [[social equality]] was an overriding priority.\n\n[[Image:Beijing-Mean-Value-Theorem-3733.jpg|thumb|A [[mean value theorem]] equation is displayed on a bridge in [[Beijing]].]]\nThe post-[[Mao Zedong]] [[Chinese Communist Party]] leadership views education as the foundation of the [[Four Modernizations]]. In the early 1980s, [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] education became an important focus of [[education policy]]. By 1986, training skilled personnel and expanding scientific and technical knowledge had been assigned the highest priority. Although the [[humanities]] were considered important, vocational and technical skills were considered paramount for meeting China's [[modernization]] goals. The reorientation of educational priorities paralleled [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s strategy for economic development. Emphasis also was placed on the further training of the already-educated elite, who would carry on the modernization program in the coming decades. A renewed emphasis on modern science and technology led to the adoption of an outward-looking policy that encouraged learning and borrowing from abroad for advanced training in a wide range of scientific fields, beginning in 1976.\n\nBeginning at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, intellectuals were encouraged to pursue [[research]] in support of the Four Modernizations and, as long as they complied with the party's \"[[Four Cardinal Principles]]\" they were given relatively free rein. However, when the party and the government determined that the structures of the four cardinal principles had been stretched beyond tolerable limits, they did not hesitate to restrict intellectual expression.\n\n[[Chinese literature|Literature]] and the [[Chinese art|arts]] also experienced a great revival in the late 1970s and 1980s. Traditional forms flourished once again, and many new kinds of literature and cultural expression were introduced from abroad.\n\nAs of 2015, the government-operated primary and lower secondary (junior high) schools in China have 28.8 million students.<ref name=HornbyReuterspointWest>Hornby, Lucy ([[Reuters]]). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=0 International Schools in China Point Students to the West] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722210045/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=0 |date=July 22, 2016 }}\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6bY5fQVia?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/international-schools-in-china-point-students-to-the-west.html?_r=1 Archive]).

By 1999, primary school education had become generalized in 90% of China, and mandatory nine-year compulsory education now effectively covered 85% of the population.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Xiaohuan\n|last=Su\n|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e\n|year=2002\n|isbn=978-7-80113-993-1\n|title=Education in China: reforms and innovations\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4w8OZEy00aYC&pg=PA37\n|access-date=February 19, 2016\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317215416/https://books.google.com/books?id=4w8OZEy00aYC&pg=PA37\n|archive-date=March 17, 2017\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\nWhile the central and provincial governments provide some funding for education, this varies from province to province, and funding in the rural areas is notably lower than in major urban municipalities. Families must supplement money provided to the school by the government with tuition fees, which means that some children have much less. However, parents place a very high value on education and make great personal sacrifices to send their children to school and university. Illiteracy in the young and mid-aged population has fallen from over 80 percent down to five percent. The system trained some 60 million mid- or high-level professionals and near 400 million laborers to the junior or senior high school level. Today, 250 million Chinese get three levels of school education, (elementary, junior and senior high school) doubling the rate of increase in the rest of the world during the same period. Net elementary school enrollment has reached 98.9 percent, and the gross enrollment rate in junior high schools 94.1 percent.\n\nChina's educational horizons are expanding. In the 1980s, the [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] was virtually unknown but by 2004 there were 47,000 MBAs, trained at 62 MBA schools. Many people also apply for international professional qualifications, such as [[Master of Business Administration|EMBA]] and [[Master of Accountancy|MPA]]; close to 10,000 MPA students are enrolled in 47 schools of higher learning, including [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The education market has rocketed, with training and testing for professional qualifications, such as computer and foreign languages, thriving. [[Continuing education]] is the trend, once in one's life schooling has become [[lifelong learning]].\n\nInternational cooperation and education exchanges increase every year. China has more students studying abroad than any other country; since 1979, there have been 697,000 Chinese students studying in 103 countries and regions, of whom 185,000 have returned after finishing their studies. The number of foreign students studying in China has increased rapidly; in 2004, over 110,000 students from 178 countries were studying at China's universities.\n\nInvestment in education has increased in recent years; the proportion of the overall budget allocated to education has been increased by one percentage point every year since 1998. According to a [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] program, the government will set up an educational finance system in line with the [[public finance]] system, strengthen the responsibility of governments at all levels in educational investment, and ensure that their financial allocation for educational expenditure grows faster than their regular revenue. The program also set out the government's aim that educational investment should account for four percent of GDP in a relatively short period of time.\n\nFor non-compulsory education, China adopts a shared-cost mechanism, charging tuition at a certain percentage of the cost. Meanwhile, to ensure that students from low-income families have access to higher education, the government has initiated effective ways of assistance, with policies and measures as scholarships, work-study programs, subsidies for students with special economic difficulties, tuition reduction or exemption and state stipends.\n\nThe government has committed itself to markedly raising educational levels generally, as evidenced in a Ministry of Education program; by 2020, of every 100,000 people, 13,500 will have had a junior college education or above and some 31,000 will have had senior high school schooling; rates for illiteracy and semi-literacy rate will fall below three percent, and average schooling duration across the population will increase from today's eight years to nearly 11.\n\nIn the 2009 test of the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the best results in mathematics, science and reading.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon | title=In PISA Test, Top Scores From Shanghai Stun Experts | date=7 December 2010 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722210058/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html?_r=1 | archive-date=July 22, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"WSJ-4739574\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_PISA1206_20101207.html |title=2009 Program for International Student Assessment Scores |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=7 December 2010 |publisher=[[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |oclc=781541372 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-access=subscription |others=Source: National Center for Education Statistics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521033958/http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_PISA1206_20101207.html |archivedate=21 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The OECD also found that even in some of the very poor rural areas the performance is close to the OECD average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2010/12/new-data-shows-shanghais-rapid-rise-as-a-world-class-education-centre.html|title=New data shows Shanghai's rapid rise as a world-class education centre|publisher=Key Trends in Globalisation|author=John Ross|access-date=December 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063710/http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2010/12/new-data-shows-shanghais-rapid-rise-as-a-world-class-education-centre.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, controversy has surrounded the high scores achieved by the Chinese students due to the unusual spread of the numerical data, with suggestions that schools were 'gaming' students for the exams.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/on-those-stunning-shanghai-test-scores/67654/|title=On Those 'Stunning' Shanghai Test Scores|magazine=The Atlantic|author=James Fallows|date=|access-date=March 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221050732/http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/on-those-stunning-shanghai-test-scores/67654/|archive-date=December 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> While averages across the breadth of other countries are reported, China's rankings are taken from only a few select districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/china-cheats-the-pisa-exams/ |title=China 'Cheats' the PISA Exams |last1=Kubo |first1=Angela Erika |date=6 December 2013 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=6 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206032429/http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/china-cheats-the-pisa-exams/ |archive-date=December 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Education policy==\n{{See also|Education policy}}\nDeng Xiaoping's far-ranging educational reform policy, which involved all levels of the education system, aimed to narrow the gap between China and other developing countries. Thus, modernizing education was critical to modernizing China, which included; devolution of educational management from the central to the local level as the means chosen to improve the education system. Centralized authority was not abandoned, however, as evidenced by the creation of the State Education Commission. Academically, the goals of reform were to enhance and universalize elementary and junior middle school education; to increase the number of schools and qualified teachers, and to develop vocational and technical education. A uniform standard for [[curriculum|curricula]], textbooks, examinations, and teacher qualifications (especially at the middle-school level) was established, and considerable autonomy and variations in and among the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities were allowed.<ref>Teach In China, [http://www.teachinchina.cn/in-2018-china-gets-opportunity-to-teaching-english-in-abroad-existing-all-over-the-world/ In 2018, China Gets Opportunity to Teaching English In Abroad Existing All Over the World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318143719/http://www.teachinchina.cn/in-2018-china-gets-opportunity-to-teaching-english-in-abroad-existing-all-over-the-world/ |date=March 18, 2018 }}</ref> Further, the system of enrolment and job assignment in higher education was changed, and excessive government control over colleges and universities was reduced.

People's congresses at various local levels were, within certain guidelines and according to local conditions, to decide the steps, methods, and deadlines for implementing nine-year compulsory education in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the central authorities. The program sought to bring rural areas, which had four to six years of compulsory schooling, into line with their urban counterparts. Education departments were exhorted to train millions of skilled workers for all trades and professions and to offer guidelines, curricula, and methods to comply with the reform program and modernization needs.\n\n[[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Provincial-level]] authorities were to develop plans, enact decrees and rules, distribute funds to counties, and administer directly a few key [[secondary school]]s. County authorities were to distribute funds to each township government, which was to make up for any deficiencies. County authorities were to supervise education and teaching and to manage their own senior middle schools, teachers' schools, teachers' in-service training schools, agricultural vocational schools, and exemplary primary and junior middle schools. The remaining schools were to be managed separately by the county and township authorities.\n\nThe compulsory education law divided China into three categories: cities and economically developed areas in coastal provinces and a small number of developed areas in the hinterland; towns and villages with medium development; and economically backward areas.\n\nBy November 1985 the first category - the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990 cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, and a small number of developed interior areas (approximately 25 percent of China's population) and areas where junior middle schools were already popularized were targeted to have universal junior-middle-school education. Education planners had envisioned that by the mid-1990s all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or vocational education and that 5 percent of the people in these areas would have a college education - building a solid intellectual foundation for China. Further, the planners expected that secondary education and university entrants would have increased by the year 2000.\n\nThe second category targeted under the 9-year compulsory education law consisted of towns and villages with medium-level development (around 50 percent of China's population), where [[universal education]] was expected to reach the junior-middle-school level by 1995. Technical and higher education was projected to develop at the same rate.\n\nThe third category, economically backward (rural) areas (around 25 percent of China's population ) were to popularize [[basic education]] without a timetable and at various levels according to local economic development, though the state would try to support educational development. The state also would assist education in minority nationality areas. In the past, rural areas, which lacked a standardized and universal primary education system, had produced generations of illiterates; only 60 percent of their primary school graduates had met established standards.\n\nAs a further example of the government's commitment to nine-year compulsory education, in January 1986 the State Council drafted a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] passed at the Fourteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress that made it illegal for any organization or individual to employ youths before they had completed their nine years of schooling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/china/65.htm|title=China - THE EDUCATION SYSTEM|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The bill also authorized free education and subsidies for students whose families had financial difficulties.\n\nTuition-free primary education is, despite compulsory education laws, still a target rather than a realized goal throughout China. As many families have difficulty paying school fees, some children are forced to leave school earlier than the nine-year goal.\n\nThe 9-year System is called \"Nine Years - One Policy\", or \"\u4e5d\u5e74\u4e00\u8d2f\u5236\" in Chinese. It usually refers to the educational integration of the elementary school and the middle school. After graduating from elementary school, graduates can directly enter into the junior middle school. The grades in schools that implement the 9-year System are usually called Grade 1, Grade 2, and so on through Grade 9.\n\nMain features of the 9-year System:\n# Continuity. Students finish education from the elementary school to the middle school.\n# The principle of proximity. Students enter into the nearby school instead of middle school entrance examination.\n# Unity. Schools that carry out the 9-year System practice unified management in school administration, teaching and education.\n\n===Basic education===\nChina's basic education involves pre-school, nine-year [[compulsory education]] from [[elementary school|elementary]] to [[junior high school]], standard senior high school education, special education for disabled children, and education for illiterate people.\n\nChina has over 200 million elementary and high school students, who, together with pre-school children, account for one sixth of the total population. For this reason, the Central Government has prioritized basic education as a key field of infrastructure construction and educational development.\n\nIn recent years, senior high school education has developed steadily. In 2004 enrollment was 8.215 million, 2.3 times that of 1988. Gross national enrollment in senior high schools has reached 43.8 percent, still lower than that of other developed countries.\n\nThe government has created a special fund to improve conditions in China's elementary and high schools, for new construction, expansion and the re-building of run-down structures. Per-capita educational expenditure for elementary and high school students has grown greatly, teaching and research equipment, books and documents being updated and renewed every year.\n\nGovernment's aim for the development of China's basic education system is to approach or attain the level of moderately [[developed countries]] by 2010.\n\nGraduates of China's primary and secondary schools test highly in both basic skills and [[critical thinking]] skills;<ref name=\"NYT73016\">{{cite news|author1=Javier C.

Because educational resources were scarce, selected (\"key\") institutions \u2013 usually those with records of past educational accomplishment \u2013 were given priority in the assignment of teachers, equipment, and funds. They also were allowed to recruit the best students for special training to compete for admission to top schools at the next level. Key schools constituted only a small percentage of all regular senior middle schools and funneled the best students into the best secondary schools, largely on the basis of entrance scores. In 1980 the greatest resources were allocated to the key schools that would produce the greatest number of college entrants.\n\nIn early 1987, efforts had begun to develop the key school from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] into a vehicle for diffusing improved curricula, materials, and teaching practices in local schools. Moreover, the appropriateness of a key school's role in the nine-year basic education plan was questioned by some officials because key schools favored urban areas and the children of more affluent and better educated parents. [[Changchun]], [[Shenyang]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], and other cities, and education departments in [[Shanghai]] and [[Tianjin]] were moving to establish a student recommendation system and eliminate key schools. In 1986 the Shanghai Educational Bureau abolished the key junior-middle-school system to ensure \"an overall level of education.\" Despite the effort to abolish the \"Key Schools\" system, the practice still exists today under other names, and education inequality is still being widely criticized by some government officials and scholars.\n\n===Training schools===\n[[Training schools in China|Training schools]], also called Training Centers, are a type of [[private school|private education]] offered by private companies that help students in China, typically 3\u201312 years old, improve their performance in academic subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[mathematics|math]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Training schools can range anywhere from a one-room operation with only one teacher, to very large corporations with hundreds of thousands of students.\n\n==Primary education==\n===Primary schools===\nThe institution of primary education in a country as vast as China has been an impressive accomplishment. In contrast to the 20 percent enrollment rate before 1949, in 1985 about 96 percent of primary school age children were enrolled in approximately 832,300 primary schools. This enrollment figure compared favorably with the recorded figures of the late 1960s and early 1970s when enrollment standards were more egalitarian. In 1985 the [[World Bank]] estimated that enrollments in primary schools would decrease from 136 million in 1983 to 95 million in the late 1990s and that the decreased enrollment would reduce the number of teachers needed. Qualified teachers, however, would continue to be in demand.\n\nUnder the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, primary schools were to be tuition-free and reasonably located for the convenience of children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without the weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.\n\nChildren usually entered primary school at seven years of age for six days a week, which after regulatory changes in 1995 and 1997 were changed to five and a half and five days, respectively. The two-semester school year consisted of 9.5 months, and began on September 1 and March 1, with a summer vacation in July and August and a winter vacation in January and February. Urban primary schools typically divided the school week into twenty-four to twenty-seven classes of forty-five minutes each, but in the rural areas, the norm was half-day schooling, more flexible schedules, and itinerant teachers. Most primary schools had a five-year course, except in such cities as [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], and later other major cities, which had reintroduced six-year primary schools and accepted children at six and one-half years rather than seven.\n\nThe primary-school curriculum consisted of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], [[physical education]], [[music]], [[drawing]], and elementary instruction in [[nature]], [[history]], and [[geography]], combined with practical work experiences around the school compound. General knowledge of politics and moral training, which stressed the love of the motherland, love of the party, and love of the people (and previously love of Chairman Mao), was another part of the curriculum. A foreign language, often [[English language|English]], is introduced in about the [[third grade]]. Chinese and mathematics accounted for about 60 percent of the scheduled class time; [[natural science]] and [[social science]] accounted for about 8 percent. [[Putonghua]] (commonly spoken language) was taught in regular schools and [[pinyin]] romanization in lower grades and kindergarten. The Ministry of Education required that all primary schools offer courses on [[morality]] and [[ethics]]. Beginning in the fourth grade, students usually had to perform productive labor two weeks per semester to relate classwork with production experience in workshops or on farms and relate it to academic study. Most schools had after-hour activities at least one day per week to involve students in recreation and community service.\n\nBy 1980 the percentage of students enrolled in primary schools were high, but the schools reported high [[dropping out|dropout]] rates and regional enrollment gaps (most enrollees were concentrated in the cities). Only one in four counties had universal primary education. On average, 10 percent of the students dropped out between each grade. During the 1979\u201383 period, the government acknowledged the \"9-6-3\" rule, that is, that nine of ten children began primary school, six completed it, and three graduated with good performance. This meant that only about 60 percent of primary students actually completed their five-year program of study and graduated, and only about 30 percent were regarded as having primary-level competence. Statistics in the mid-1980s showed that more rural girls than boys dropped out of school.\n\nWithin the framework of the ''Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education'' and the general trend toward vocational and technical skills, attempts were made to accommodate and correct the gap between urban and rural education. Urban and key schools almost invariably operated on a six-day full-time schedule to prepare students for further education and high-level jobs. Rural schools generally operated on a flexible schedule geared to the needs of the agricultural seasons and sought to prepare students for adult life and manual labor in lower-skilled jobs. They also offered a more limited curriculum, often only [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], and [[morality|morals]]. To promote attendance and allow the class schedule and academic year to be completed, agricultural seasons were taken into account. School holidays were moved, school days shortened, and full-time, half-time, and spare-time classes offered in the slack agricultural seasons. Sometimes itinerant teachers were hired for mountain villages and served one village in the morning, another village in the afternoon.\n\nRural parents were generally well aware that their children had limited opportunities to further their education. Some parents saw little use in having their children attend even primary school, especially after the establishment of the agricultural [[responsibility system]]. Under that system, parents preferred that their children work to increase family income - and withdrew them from school - for both long and short periods of time.\n\n===Preschool education===\n[[Preschool education]], which began at age three, was another target of education reform in 1985. Preschool facilities were to be established in buildings made available by public enterprises, [[production team (China)|production teams]], [[municipal authorities]], local groups, and families. The government announced that it depended on individual organizations to sponsor their own preschool education and that preschool education was to become a part of the welfare services of various government organizations, institutes, and state- and collectively operated enterprises. Costs for preschool education varied according to services rendered. Officials also called for more preschool teachers with more appropriate training.\n\n===Special education===\nThe 1985 National Conference on Education also recognized the importance of [[special education]], in the form of programs for [[gifted children]] and for slow learners. Gifted children were allowed to skip grades. Slow learners were encouraged to reach minimum standards, although those who did not maintain the pace seldom reached the next stage. For the most part, children with severe learning problems and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories. The China Welfare Fund, established in 1984, received state funding and had the right to solicit donations within China and from abroad, but special education has remained a low government priority.\n\nToday, China has 1,540 schools for special education, with 375,000 students; more than 1,000 vocational training institutes for disabled people, nearly 3,000 standard vocational training and education institutes that also admit disabled people; more than 1,700 training organizations for rehabilitating hearing-impaired children, with over 100,000 trained and in-training children. In 2004, 4,112 disabled students entered ordinary schools of higher learning. Of disabled children receiving special education, 63.6 percent of total recruitment numbers and 66.2 percent of enrollment were in ordinary schools or special classes thereof.\n\n==Secondary education==\n===History===\n[[File:5878-Linxia-High-School-admission-results-posted-outside-the-gate.jpg|thumb|Lists of newly admitted students - complete with their home communities, test scores, and any [[affirmative action|extra points]] they derived due to their [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnicity]] or [[One child policy|family size]] - posted outside of [[Linxia High School]]]]\nSecondary education in China has a complicated history. In the early 1960s, education planners followed a policy called \"walking on two legs,\" which established both regular academic schools and separate technical schools for vocational training. The rapid expansion of secondary education during the Cultural Revolution created serious problems; because resources were spread too thinly, educational quality declined. Further, this expansion was limited to regular secondary schools; technical schools were closed during the Cultural Revolution because they were viewed as an attempt to provide inferior education to children of worker and peasant families.\n\nIn the late 1970s, government and party representatives criticized what they termed the \"unitary\" approach of the 1960s, arguing that it ignored the need for two kinds of graduates: those with an academic education (college preparatory) and those with specialized technical education (vocational). Beginning in 1976 with the renewed emphasis on technical training, technical schools reopened, and their enrollments increased.\n\nIn the drive to spread vocational and technical education, regular secondary-school enrollments fell. By 1986 universal secondary education was part of the nine-year compulsory education law that made primary education (six years) and junior-middle-school education (three years) mandatory. The desire to consolidate existing schools and to improve the quality of key middle schools was, however, under the education reform, more important than expanding enrollment.\n\n===Junior secondary===\nJunior secondary education is more commonly known as (junior) middle school education, it consists the last three years of nine years compulsory education. Students who live in rural areas are often boarded into townships to receive their education.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation|last = Woodman|first = Dan|publisher = Sage|year = 2015|isbn = 9781446259054|location = Los Angeles|pages = 156|last2 = Wyn|first2 = Johanna}}</ref>\n\n===Senior secondary===\n[[File:SS Frontgate.JPG|220px|thumb| [[Guangdong Experimental High School]], one of the key high schools based in [[Guangzhou]], China. ]]\nSenior secondary education often refers to three years of [[high school]] (or called senior middle school) education, as from grade 10 to grade 12. Normally, students who have finished six years of primary education will continue three more years of academic study in middle schools as regulated by the [[Education in China#Compulsory education law|Compulsory education law]] at the age of twelve. This, however, is not compulsory for senior secondary education, where junior graduates may choose to continue a three-year academic education in academic high schools, which will eventually lead to university or to switch to a vocational course in vocational high schools.\n\nGenerally, high school years usually have two [[semester]]s, starting in September and February. In some rural areas, the operation may be subject to agricultural cycles. The number of lessons offered by a school every week is very subjective and largely depends on the school's resources. In addition to normal lessons, periods for private study and extracurricular activity are provided as well. The academic curriculum consists of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], [[Geography]], [[History]], [[Ideology]] & [[Political Science]], [[Music]], [[Fine Art]]s, [[Physical Education|PE]], [[Technology]], [[Computing]], etc. Some schools may also offer vocational subjects. Generally speaking, [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], and [[English language|English]] are considered as three main subjects as they will definitely be examined in [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|Gaokao]]. In most provinces, students also need to be examined in either natural sciences, which incorporate [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]], or social sciences, which incorporate [[Geography]], [[History]], and [[Ideology]] & [[Political Science]].\n\nIn China, a senior high school graduate will be considered as an educated person, although the majority of graduates will go on to universities or vocational colleges. Given that the competition for limited university places is extremely intense, most high schools are evaluated by their academic performance in [[Gaokao]] by parents and students.\n\n====Admissions and Zhongkao====\n{{main|Senior High School Entrance Examination}}\n'''Zhongkao''' (\u4e2d\u8003), the [[Senior High School Entrance Examination]], is the academic examination held annually in China to distinguish junior graduates. Generally speaking, students will be tested in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Political Science]] and [[Physical education|PE]]. However, the scoring system may change, and vary between different areas.\n\nAdmission for senior high schools, especially selective high schools, is somewhat similar to the one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.\n\nThere are other official rules of admission in certain top high schools. If a prestigious senior high school wants to admit 800 students a year, the admissions office ranks students\u2019 scores from highest to lowest and then selects their first 700 students. The other 100 positions are provided to the students who do not meet the required standard, but still want to study at that school. These prospects need to pay extra school fees. A student can't perform badly in Zhongkao, if their scores are close to the required standard, they could still study in that top school if they can afford the expenses. Those who study in that high school must place a maximum of two points below the standard requirement. Usually, 0.5 points is a standard. For instance, if a student is two points below the standard requirement, they pay four times as much as the student who gets 0.5 points below the standard requirement. The admissions of the 100 students who are required to pay the school fees usually do not get the same admission letters as normal students receive, but they can still study and live with normal students in the same high school, with the same teacher.\n\n====Vocational and technical schools====\nThe \"Law on Vocational Education\" was issued in 1996. [[Vocational education]] embraces higher vocational schools, secondary skill schools, vestibule schools, vocational high schools, job-finding centers and other adult skills and social training institutes. To enable vocational education to better accommodate the demands of economic re-structuring and urbanization, in recent years the government has remodeled vocational education, oriented towards obtaining employment and focusing on two major vocational education projects to meet society's ever more acute demand for high quality, skilled workers. These are cultivating skilled workers urgently needed in modern manufacturing and service industries; and training rural laborers moving to urban areas. To accelerate vocational education in western areas, the Central Government has used government bonds to build 186 vocational education centers in impoverished western area counties.\n\nBoth regular and vocational secondary schools sought to serve modernization needs. A number of technical and \"skilled-worker\" training schools reopened after the Cultural Revolution, and an effort was made to provide exposure to vocational subjects in general secondary schools (by offering courses in the industry, services, business, and agriculture). By 1985 there were almost 3 million vocational and technical students.\n\nUnder the educational reform tenets, [[polytechnic college]]s were to give priority to admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.\n\nAlthough enrollment in technical schools of various kinds had not yet increased enough to compensate for decreasing enrollments in regular senior middle schools, the proportion of vocational and technical students to total senior-middle-school students increased from about 5 percent in 1978 to almost 36 percent in 1985, although development was uneven. Further, to encourage greater numbers of junior-middle-school graduates to enter technical schools, vocational and technical school graduates were given priority in job assignments, while other job seekers had to take technical tests.\n\nIn 1987 there were four kinds of secondary vocational and technical schools:\n\n1. Technical schools, which offered a four-year, post-junior middle course and two- to three-year post-senior middle training in such fields as [[commerce]], [[Chinese law|legal work]], [[fine arts]], and [[forestry]];\n\n2. Workers' training schools, which accepted students whose senior-middle-school education consisted of two years of training in such trades as carpentry and welding;\n\n3. Vocational technical schools, which accepted either junior-or senior-middle-school students for one- to three-year courses in [[cooking]], [[tailoring]], [[photography]], and other services; and\n\n4. Agricultural middle schools, which offered basic subjects and [[agricultural science]].\n\nThese technical schools had several hundred different programs. Their narrow [[Academic specialization|specializations]] had advantages in that they offered in-depth training, reducing the need for on-the-job training and thereby lowering [[learning]] time and costs. Moreover, students were more motivated to study if there were links between training and future jobs. Much of the training could be done at existing [[Business|enterprises]], where staff and equipment was available at little additional cost.\n\nThere were some disadvantages to this system, however. Under the [[Four Modernizations]], technically trained generalists were needed more than highly specialized [[technician]]s. Also, highly specialized equipment and staff were underused, and there was an overall shortage of specialized facilities to conduct training. In addition, large expenses were incurred in providing the necessary facilities and staff, and the trend in some government technical agencies was toward more general technical and vocational education.\n\nFurther, the dropout rate continued to have a negative effect on the labor pool as upper-secondary-school technical students dropped out and as the percentage of lower-secondary-school graduates entering the labor market without job training increased. [[wikt:occupation|Occupational]] rigidity and the geographic im[[population mobility|mobility]] of the population, particularly in rural areas, further limited educational choices.\n\nAlthough there were 668,000 new polytechnic school enrollments in 1985, the Seventh Five-Year Plan called for annual increases of 2 million mid-level skilled workers and 400,000 senior technicians, indicating that enrollment levels were still far from sufficient. To improve the situation, in July 1986 officials from the State Education Commission, State Planning Commission, and Ministry of Labor and Personnel convened a national conference on developing China's technical and vocational education. It was decided that technical and vocational education in rural areas should accommodate local conditions and be conducted on a short-term basis. Where conditions permitted, the emphasis would be placed on organizing technical schools and short-term training classes. To alleviate the shortage of teachers, vocational and technical teachers' colleges were to be reformed and other colleges and universities were to be mobilized for assistance. The State Council decided to improve training for workers who had passed technical examinations (as opposed to unskilled workers) was intended to reinforce the development of vocational and technical schools.\n\nExpanding and improving secondary vocational education has long been an objective of China's educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation's expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained workforce, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, a pot of money for secondary schools, an allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education. Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over vocational secondary education which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public's perception is that these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China's modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question the policy that pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.\n\n==International education==\n[[File:ShanghaiAmericanSchoolPuxi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shanghai American School]] Puxi Campus]]\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group > Home|publisher=|access-date=January 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130003317/http://www.iscresearch.com/|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> listed China as having 481 international schools.<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group > Information > ISC News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\"<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\"/> This definition is used by publications including ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|work=The Economist|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215730/http://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> There were 177,400 students enrolled in international schools in 2014.<ref name=Geboominginternational>Ge, Celine. \"[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1855932/chinas-booming-international-school-business-untouched China's booming international school business untouched by slowdown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918032348/http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1855932/chinas-booming-international-school-business-untouched |date=September 18, 2015 }}.\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.

[[Postgraduate education]] is the fastest growing sector, with 24.1 percent more students recruited and 25.9 percent more [[researchers]] than the year before. This enrollment growth indicates that China has entered the stage of popular education. The [[UNESCO]] world higher education report of June 2003 pointed out that the student population of China's schools of higher learning had doubled in a very short time, and was the world's largest.\n\nParticular attention has been paid to improving systems in recent reforms. Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., [[automation]], [[nuclear power]], [[energy resources]], [[oceanography]], [[nuclear physics]], [[computer science]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[polymer physics]], [[radiochemistry]], [[physical chemistry]] and [[biophysics]]. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools of higher learning into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher learning has produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards. More than 30 universities have received help from a special national fund to support their attainment of the world elite class.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2003, enrollment in higher education increased from 1.6 million to 3.82 million. In 2004, the total enrollment in ordinary schools of higher learning was 4.473 million, 651,000 more than in 2003. Schools of higher learning and research institutes enrolled 326,000 postgraduate students, 57,000 more than the previous year. In 2010 China is expecting 6.3 million students to graduate from College or University, with 63% likely to enter the workforce.<ref>The China Perspective [http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinatoproduce63millioncollegegraduatesin20106518/index.html China to Produce 6.3 Million College Graduates in 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104103309/http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinatoproduce63millioncollegegraduatesin20106518/index.html |date=November 4, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe contribution to China's economic construction and social development made by research in the higher education sector is becoming ever more evident. By strengthening cooperation among their production, teaching and research, schools of higher learning are speeding up the process in turning sci-tech research results into products, giving rise to many new and hi-tech enterprises and important [[innovation]]s. Forty-three national university sci-tech parks have been started or approved, some of which have become important bases for commercializing research.\n\n===Background===\nThe quality of [[Higher education]] in modern China has changed at various times, reflecting shifts in the political policies implemented by the central government. Following the founding of the PRC, in 1949, the Chinese government's educational focus was largely on political \"[[Mind control|re-education]]\". In periods of political upheaval, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], ideology was stressed over professional or technical competence. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1969), tens of thousands of college students joined [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] organizations, which persecuted many university faculty members as \"counter-revolutionaries\" and effectively closed China's universities. When universities reopened in the early 1970s, enrollments were reduced from pre-Cultural Revolution levels, and admission was restricted to individuals who had been recommended by their [[work unit]] (''danwei''), possessed good political credentials, and had distinguished themselves in [[manual labor]]. In the absence of stringent and reasonably objective entrance examinations, political connections became increasingly important in securing the recommendations and political dossiers necessary to qualify for university admission. As a result, the decline in educational quality was profound. [[Deng Xiaoping]] reportedly wrote Mao Zedong in 1975 that university graduates were \"not even capable of reading a book\" in their own fields when they left the university. University faculty and administrators were demoralized by the political aspects of the university system.\n\nEfforts made in 1975 to improve educational quality were unsuccessful. By 1980 it appeared doubtful that the politically oriented admission criteria had accomplished even the purpose of increasing enrollment of workers and peasant children. Successful candidates for university entrance were usually children of cadres and officials who used personal connections that allowed them to \"enter through the back door.\" Students from officials' families would accept the requisite minimum two-year work assignment in the countryside, often in a suburban location that allowed them to remain close to their families. Village cadres, anxious to please the parents/officials, gladly recommended these youths for university placement after the labor requirement had been met. The child of an official family was then on his or her way to a university without having academic ability, a record of political activism, or a distinguished work record.\n\nAfter the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, steps were taken to improve educational quality by establishing order and stability, calling for an end to political contention on university campuses, and expanding university enrollments. This pressure to maintain quality and minimize [[expenditure]]s led to efforts both to run existing institutions more efficiently and to develop other college and university programs. As a result, labor colleges for training agro-technicians and factory-run colleges for providing technical education for workers were established. In addition, eighty-eight institutions and key universities were provided with special funding, top students and faculty members, and other support, and they recruited the most academically qualified students without regard to family background or political activism.\n\n===Modernization goals in the 1980s===\n[[File:VM 5489 Xian Station plaza.jpg|thumb|Representatives of [[Xi'an]] universities ready to welcome new students at booths set up outside of the city's train station throughout the late summer]]\nThe commitment to the [[Four Modernizations]] required great advances in science and technology. Under the [[modernization]] program, higher education was to be the cornerstone for [[training]] and [[research]]. Because modernization depended on a vastly increased and improved capability to train [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s for needed breakthroughs, the renewed concern for higher education and academic quality - and the central role that the sciences were expected to play in the Four Modernizations - highlighted the need for scientific research and training. This concern can be traced to the critical [[personnel]] shortages and qualitative deficiencies in the sciences resulting from the unproductive years of the Cultural Revolution when higher education was shut down. In response to the need for scientific training, the Sixth Plenum of the Twelfth National Party Congress Central Committee, held in September 1986, adopted a resolution on the guiding principles for building a [[socialist]] society that strongly emphasized the importance of [[education]] and [[science]].\n\nReformers realized, however, that the higher education system was far from meeting modernization goals and that additional changes were needed. The Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Institutions of Higher Learning, promulgated by the State Council in 1986, initiated vast changes in administration and adjusted educational opportunity, direction, and content. With the increased independence accorded under the education reform, universities and colleges were able to choose their own teaching plans and curricula; to accept projects from or cooperate with other socialist establishments for scientific research and technical development in setting up \"combines\" involving teaching, scientific research, and production; to suggest appointments and removals of vice presidents and other staff members; to take charge of the distribution of [[Fixed capital|capital]] construction investment and funds allocated by the state; and to be responsible for the development of international exchanges by using their own funds.\n\nThe changes also allowed the universities to accept financial aid from work units and decide how this money was to be used without asking for more money from departments in charge of education. Further, higher education institutions and work units could sign contracts for the training of students.\n\nHigher education institutions also were assigned a greater role in running inter-regional and inter-departmental schools. Within their state-approved [[budget]]s, universities secured more freedom to allocate funds as they saw fit and to use the income from [[tuition]] and technical and advisory services for their own development, including collective welfare and bonuses.\n\nThere also was a renewed interest in television, radio, and correspondence classes (see [[distance learning]] and [[electronic learning]]). Some of the courses, particularly in the college-run factories, were serious, full-time enterprises, with a two- to three-year [[curriculum]].\n\n====Entrance examinations and admission criteria====\n{{main|National Higher Education Entrance Examination}}\n\nNational examinations to select students for higher education (and positions of leadership) were an important part of [[Culture of China|China's culture]], and, traditionally, entrance to a higher education institution is considered prestigious. Although the [[examination system]] for admission to colleges and universities has undergone many changes since the Cultural Revolution, it remains the basis for recruiting academically able students. When higher education institutions were reopened in the early 1970s, candidates for entrance examinations had to be senior-middle-school graduates or the equivalent, generally below twenty-six years of age. Work experience requirements were eliminated, but workers and staff members needed permission from their enterprises to take the examinations.\n\nEach provincial-level unit was assigned a quota of students to be admitted to key universities, the second quota of students for regular universities within that administrative division, and a third quota of students from other provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities who would be admitted to institutions operated at the provincial level. Provincial-level administrative units selected students with outstanding records to take the examinations. Additionally, preselection examinations were organized by the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities for potential students (from three to five times the number of places allotted). These candidates were actively encouraged to take the examination to ensure that a sufficient number of good applicants would be available. [[Professional revolutionaries|Cadres]] with at least two years of work experience were recruited for selected departments in a small number of universities on an experimental basis. Preferential admission treatment (in spite of lower test scores) was given to minority candidates, students from disadvantaged areas, and those who agreed in advance to work in less developed regions after graduation.\n\nIn December 1977, when uniform national examinations were reinstated, 5.7 million students took the examinations, although university placement was available for only the 278,000 applicants with the highest scores. In July 1984, about 1.6 million candidates (30,000 fewer than in 1983) took the entrance examinations for the 430,000 places in China's more than 900 colleges and universities. Of the 1.6 million examinees, more than 1 million took the test for placement in [[science]] and [[engineering]] colleges; 415,000 for places in [[liberal arts]] colleges; 88,000 for placement in [[foreign language]] institutions; and 15,000 for placement in [[sports]] universities and schools. More than 100,000 of the candidates were from national minority groups. A year later, there were approximately 1.8 million students taking the three-day college entrance examination to compete for 560,000 places. Liberal arts candidates were tested on [[politics]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[mathematics]], [[foreign languages]], [[history]], and [[geography]]. Science and engineering candidates were tested on politics, Chinese, mathematics, [[chemistry]], and [[biology]]. Entrance examinations also were given in 1985 for professional and technical schools, which sought to enroll 550,000 new students.\n\nOther [[innovation]]s in enrollment practices, included allowing colleges and universities to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to try an experimental student recommendation system - fixed at 2 percent of the total enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for [[teachers' college]]s - instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.\n\nIn addition to the written examination, university applicants had to pass a physical examination and a political screening. Less than 2 percent of the students who passed the written test were eliminated for reasons of poor health. The number disqualified for political reasons was known, but publicly the party maintained that the number was very small and that it sought to ensure that only the most able students actually entered colleges and universities.\n\nBy 1985 the number of institutions of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]] issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.\n\nIn 1985 state quotas for university places were set, allowing both for students sponsored by institutions and for those paying their own expenses. This policy was a change from the previous system in which all students were enrolled according to guidelines established in Beijing. All students except those at military school or police academy, those who had financial difficulties, and those who were to work under adverse conditions after graduation had to pay for their own tuition, accommodations, and miscellaneous [[expenses]].\n\n====Changes in enrollment and assignment policies====\nThe children enrollment and graduate assignment system also were changed to reflect more closely the personnel needs of [[modernization]]. By 1986 the state was responsible for drafting the enrollment plan, which took into account future personnel demands, the need to recruit students from outlying regions and the needs of trades and professions with adverse working conditions. Moreover, a certain number of graduates to be trained for the [[People's Liberation Army]] were included in the state enrollment plan. In most cases, enrollment in higher education institutions at the employers' request was extended as a supplement to the state student enrollment plan. Employers were to pay a percentage of training fees, and students were to fulfill [[contract]]ual obligations to the employers after graduation. The small number of students who attended colleges and universities at their own expense could be enrolled in addition to those in the state plan.\n\nAccompanying the changes in enrollment practices were reforms (adopted 1986) in the faculty appointment system, which ended the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\" employment system and permitted colleges and universities to decide which [[academic department]]s, which [[academic major]]s, and how many teachers they needed. Teachers in institutions of higher learning were hired on a basis, usually for two to four years at a time. The teaching positions available on basis were [[teaching assistant]], [[lecturer]], [[associate professor]], and [[professor]]. The system was tested in eight major universities in Beijing and Shanghai before it was instituted nationwide at the end of 1985. University presidents headed groups in charge of appointing professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants according to their academic levels and teaching abilities, and a more rational wage system, geared to different job levels, was inaugurated. Universities and colleges with surplus professors and researchers were advised to grant them appropriate academic titles and encourage them to work for their current pay in schools of higher learning where they were needed. The new system was to be extended to schools of all kinds and other education departments within two years.\n\nUnder the 1985 reforms, all graduates were assigned jobs by the state; a central government placement agency told the schools where to send graduates. By 1985 [[Tsinghua University]] and a few other universities were experimenting with a system that allowed graduates to accept job offers or to look for their own positions. For example, of 1,900 Tsinghua University graduates in 1985, 1,200 went on to graduate school, 48 looked for their own jobs, and the remainder were assigned jobs by the school after consultation with the students. The college students and [[postgraduate]]s scheduled to graduate in 1986 were assigned primarily to work in [[forestry]], [[education]], [[textiles]], and the [[armaments]] industry. Graduates still were needed in [[civil engineering]], [[computer science]], and [[finance]].\n\n====Scholarship and loan system====\nIn July 1986 the State Council announced that the [[stipend]] system for [[university]] and [[college]] students would be replaced with a new scholarship and loan system. The new system, to be tested in selected institutions during the 1986\u201387 academic year, was designed to help students who could not cover their own living expenses but who studied hard, obeyed state laws, and observed [[discipline]] codes. Students eligible for financial aid were to apply to the schools and the [[China Industrial and Commercial Bank]] for low-[[interest]] [[loan]]s. Three categories of students eligible for aid were established: top students encouraged to attain all-around [[excellence]]; students specializing in [[education]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[sports]], and [[marine navigation]]; and students willing to work in poor, remote, and border regions or under harsh conditions, such as in [[mining]] and [[engineering]]. In addition, free tuition and board were to be offered at military school, and the graduates were required to join the army for at least five years in relevant positions. For those who worked in an approved rural position after graduation, student's loans would be paid off by his or her employer, such as a school, in a [[lump sum]]. And the money was to be repaid to the employer by the student through five years of [[payroll]] deductions.\n\n====Study Abroad====\nIn addition to loans, another means of raising educational quality, particularly in [[science]], was to send students abroad to study. A large number of Chinese students studied in the [[Soviet Union]] before educational links and other cooperative programs with the Soviet Union were severed in the late 1950s (see [[Sino-Soviet split]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, China continued to send a small number of students abroad, primarily to [[Europe]]an universities. In October 1978 Chinese students began to arrive in the [[United States]]; their numbers accelerated after normalization of relations between the two countries in January 1979, a policy consistent with [[modernization]] needs. Although figures vary, more than 36,000 students, including 7,000 self-supporting students (those who paid their own way, received [[scholarship]]s from host institutions, or received help from relatives and \"foreign friends\"), studied in 14 countries between 1978 and 1984. Of this total, 78 percent were technical personnel sent abroad for [[advanced study]]. As of mid-1986, there were 15,000 Chinese scholars and graduates in American universities, compared with a total of 19,000 scholars sent between 1979 and 1983.\n\nChinese students sent to the United States generally were not typical undergraduates or graduate students but were mid-career scientists, often thirty-five to forty-five years of age, seeking advanced training in their areas of [[Academic specialization|specialization]]. Often they were individuals of exceptional ability who occupied responsible positions in Chinese universities and research institutions. Fewer than 15 percent of the earliest arrivals were degree candidates. Nearly all the visiting scholars were in scientific fields.\n\n===Educational investment===\nMany of the problems that had hindered higher educational development in the past continued in 1987. Funding remained a major problem because [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] study and research and study abroad were expensive. Because education was competing with other [[modernization]] programs, the capital was critically short. Another concern was whether or not the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]] was sufficiently advanced to make efficient use of the highly trained technical personnel it planned to educate. For example, some observers believed that it would be more realistic to train a [[literate]] work force of low-level technicians instead of research scientists. Moreover, it was feared that using an examination to recruit the most able students might advance people who were merely good at taking examinations. Educational reforms also made some people uncomfortable by criticizing the traditional practice of rote memorization and promoting innovative teaching and study methods.\n\nThe prestige associated with higher education caused a demand for it. But many qualified youths were unable to attend colleges and universities because China could not finance enough university places for them. To help meet the demand and to educate a highly trained, specialized work force, China established alternate forms of higher education - such as spare-time, part-time, and radio and television universities.\n\nChina could not afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the education of a few students. Since 1978 China's leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party's principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China's leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to [[siphon]] off more than its share of funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.\n\nFamilies have had to cover for government indifference by making personal investments in their children's education. However, the Chinese economy may not be able to effectively absorb the resulting influx of college graduates, who may need to settle for lower paying jobs, if they can find those.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/in-china-families-bet-it-all-on-a-child-in-college.html|title=In China, Families Bet It All on College for Their Children|date=17 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414043237/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/in-china-families-bet-it-all-on-a-child-in-college.html|archive-date=April 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Reform in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Ant Tribe|label 1=Graduate underemployment in China}}\nIn 1998 the Chinese government proposed to expand the university enrollment of professional and specialized graduates and to develop world-class universities. Restructuring, through consolidations, mergers, and shifts among the authorities which supervise institutions, was aimed at addressing the problems of small size and low efficiency. Higher [[vocational education]] was also restructured, and there was a general tendency there to emphasize elite institutions. This rapid expansion of mass higher education has resulted in not only a strain in teaching resources, but also higher [[unemployment]] rates among graduates. The creation of private universities, not under governmental control, remains slow and its future uncertain. The restructuring of higher education, in the words of one academic \"has created a clearly escalating [[social stratification]] pattern among institutions, stratified by geography, source of funding, administrative unit, as well as by functional category (e.g., comprehensive, law, medical, etc.).\"<ref>Jin Xiao, \"China's Educational Reform in Transition: Is it Transforming?\" Chinese University of Hong Kong, unpublished paper, 2007.</ref> Thus, although recent reform has arguably improved over-all educational quality, they have created new, different issues of [[Equality of opportunity|equity]] and efficiency that will need to be addressed as the century proceeds.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities. The results of this evaluation are used to support the next major planned policy initiative. The last substantial national evaluation of universities, which was undertaken in 1994, resulted in the 'massification' of higher education as well as a renewed emphasis on elite institutions.<ref>Rui Yang, \"Chapter 8.

Since Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University started independent enrollment before College Entrance Examination in 2007, some of the top Chinese colleges began to follow them using a new method to choose students besides a unified examination system. In accordance with university regulations, those colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students. Students can get admitted by taking a specific exam or interview before the College Entrance Examination. In this way, students have more chances to get admitted by the top colleges. In 2010, there were several critical reforms in the education field. In January 31, the education ministry in Guangdong province began to implement parallel voluntary admission in the college entrance recruiting system, which is an efficient way to decrease the risk of getting into a college for the majority of students. In November 20, the education ministry of China cancelled the additional Olympics points in the College Entrance Exam policy. It is fairer for the high school students, and efficiently reduces the heavy academic burdens for students.\nAs the economic development of China, the private school system has been gradually built up. Many private preschools began to use bilingual teaching. Furthermore, some public colleges and universities cooperated with investors to run secondary college by using public running and being sponsored by private enterprises, which promotes the development of education. On the other hand, the Technical and Vocational Education in China has developed rapidly, and become the focus of the whole society.\n\n[[File:Bixi in Harvard University - IMG 8963.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard University|Harvard]] degrees have long been respected in China.

Instead, having a degree of an ordinary Chinese university already can't satisfy the increasingly competitive society.

Currently, in schools of higher learning, professors and assistant professors account for 9.5 percent and 30 percent respectively. Young and middle-aged teachers predominate; teachers under age 45 account for 79 percent of total faculty, and under age 35 for 46 percent. Teachers in higher education constitute a vital contingent in [[scientific research]], knowledge innovation and sci-tech. Of all academicians in the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], 40.7 percent (280) are in the higher education sector; for the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]] the corresponding figure is 35.3 percent (234).\n\nAmong the most pressing problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified [[teacher]]s, which has led to a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked [[professional training]]. Estimates indicated that in order to meet the goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million new teachers for primary schools, 750,000 new teachers for junior middle schools, and 300,000 new teachers for senior middle schools. Estimates predict, however, that the demand for teachers will drop in the late 1990s because of an anticipated decrease in primary-school [[education|enrollments]].\n\nTo cope with the shortage of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 percent of the time to subject teaching, 6 percent to [[pedagogy]] and [[psychology]], and 10 percent to [[teaching methods]]. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula were devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.\n\nBy 1985 there were more than 1,000 teacher training schools - an indispensable tool in the effort to solve the acute shortage of qualified teachers. These schools, however, were unable to supply the number of teachers needed to attain [[modernization]] goals through 1990. Although a considerable number of students graduated as qualified teachers from institutions of [[Higher Learning]], the relatively low social status and salary levels of teachers hampered recruitment, and not all of the graduates of teachers' colleges became teachers. To attract more teachers, China tried to make teaching a more desirable and respected profession. To this end, the government designated September 10 as [[Teachers' Day]], granted teachers pay raises, and made teachers' colleges tuition free. To further arrest the teacher shortage, in 1986 the central government sent teachers to underdeveloped regions to train local schoolteachers.\n\nBecause urban teachers continued to earn more than their rural counterparts and because academic standards in the countryside had dropped, it remained difficult to recruit teachers for rural areas. Teachers in rural areas also had production responsibilities for their plots of land, which took time from their teaching. Rural primary teachers needed to supplement their pay by farming because most were paid by the relatively poor local communities rather than by the state.\n\n==Adult and online education==\n{{See also|Adult education|Continuing education|Distance education|Lifelong learning}}\nThe participation of big investors in [[online education]] has made it a new hotspot for investment in the education industry. Students of remote and under-developed areas are the biggest beneficiaries of online education, but online universities offer students who failed [[National College Entrance Examination|university entrance examinations]] and working people the chance of lifelong education and learning.\n\nThe Ministry of Education has approved 68 ordinary schools of higher learning and the Central Radio and TV University to pilot modern distance education. By the end of 2003, these schools had established 2,027 off-campus learning centers around China, offering 140 majors in ten disciplines, and had a total enrollment of 1.373 million.\n\nThe gradual spread of broadband technology has also helped online education. The [[China Education and Research Network]] (CERNET), started in 1994, is now China's second largest Internet network, covering all major cities of China. The high-speed connection between it and the China Education Broadband Satellite Net opened in 2000, established a \"space to earth\" transmission platform for modern distance education, and provided an all-round network supporting environment for distance education.\n\nAdult education is both dynamic and diverse. Schools of higher learning for adults include radio and TV, worker, farmer, correspondence and evening universities, management and education colleges; adult secondary schools include vocational, high and skills training schools; worker elementary and farmer elementary schools comprise the adult elementary sector.\n\n===Role in modernization===\nBecause only 4 percent of the nation's secondary education graduates are admitted to universities, China has found it necessary to develop other ways of meeting the demand for education. [[Adult education]] has become increasingly important in helping China meet its [[modernization]] goals. Adult, or \"nonformal,\" education is an alternative form of higher education that encompasses [[radio]], [[television]], and [[correspondence education|correspondence]] universities, spare-time and part-time universities, [[factory]]-run universities for staff and workers, and county-run universities for peasants, many operating primarily during students' off-work hours. These alternative forms of education are economical. They had sought to educate both the \"delayed generation\" - those who lost educational opportunities during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376) - and to raise the cultural, scientific, and general education levels of workers on the job.\n\n===Forms===\nSchools have been established by government departments, businesses, trade unions, academic societies, democratic parties, and other organizations. In 1984 about 70 percent of China's factories and enterprises supported their own part-time classes, which often were referred to as workers' colleges. In Beijing alone, more than ninety adult-education schools with night schools enrolled tens of thousands of students. More than 20,000 of these students graduated annually from evening universities, workers' colleges, television universities, and correspondence schools - more than twice the number graduating from regular colleges and universities. The government spent 200 [[Renminbi|yuan]] (\u00a5) to \u00a5500 per adult education student and at least \u00a51,000 per regular university student. In 1984 approximately 1.3 million students enrolled in television, correspondence, and evening universities, about a 30 percent increase over 1983.\n\nSpare-time education for workers and peasants and [[literacy]] classes for the entire adult population were other components of [[basic education]]. Spare-time education included a very broad range of educational activities at all levels. Most spare-time schools were sponsored by factories and run for their own workers; they provided fairly [[elementary education]], as well as courses to upgrade technical skills. Most were on-the-job training and retraining courses, a normal part of any industrial system. These schools continually received publicity in the [[mass media|domestic media]] as a symbol of [[social justice]], but it was unclear whether they received adequate resources to achieve this end.\n\nChina's educational television system began in 1960 but was suspended during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In 1979 the [[Central Radio and Television University]] was established in Beijing with branches in twenty-eight provincial-level universities. Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the cut-off point for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years' work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal [[wage]]s; expenses for most of their books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours of [[homework]] each evening. The major problem with the system is that there were too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted and financed by the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]]. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. The curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities. The state gave certain allowances to students awaiting jobs during their training period.\n\n===Literacy and language reform===\n[[File:Dajia-shuo-Putonghua-2817.jpg|thumb|The [[Hanyu Pinyin]] Romanization is commonly used as a means of teaching literacy and the standard (\"Putonghua\") pronunciation]]\nThe continuing campaigns to eradicate illiteracy also were a part of [[basic education]]. Chinese government statistics indicated that of a total population of nearly 1.1 billion in 1985, about 230 million people were illiterate or semiliterate. The difficulty of mastering [[written Chinese]] makes raising the [[literacy]] rate particularly difficult. In general, language reform was intended to make writing and the [[Standard Chinese|standard language]] easier to learn, which in turn would foster both literacy and linguistic unity and serve as a foundation for a simpler written language. In 1951 the party issued a directive that inaugurated a three-part plan for language reform. The plan sought to establish universal comprehension of a standardized common language, simplify written characters, and introduce, where possible, romanized forms based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. In 1956 [[Putonghua]] ([[Modern Standard Chinese]]) was introduced as the language of instruction in schools and in the national broadcast media, and by 1977 it was in use throughout China, particularly in the government and party, and in education. Although in 1987 the government continued to endorse the goal of universalizing putonghua, hundreds of regional and local dialects continued to be spoken, complicating interregional communication.\n\nA second language reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes are easier to learn. In 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 [[simplified characters]] most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2011}}, although some people (especially in Hong Kong which is still using traditional Chinese) taught only in simplified characters were cut off from the wealth of [[Chinese literature]] written in [[traditional characters]]. Any idea of replacing the ideographic script with the romanized script was soon abandoned, however by government and education leaders.\n\nThe third area of change involved the proposal to use the [[pinyin]] romanization system more widely. Pinyin (first approved by the [[National People's Congress]] in 1958) was encouraged primarily to facilitate the spread of putonghua in regions where other dialects and languages are spoken. By the mid-1980s, however, the use of pinyin was not as widespread as the use of putonghua.\n\nRetaining literacy was as much a problem as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976. Political disorder may have contributed to the decline, but the basic problem was that the many Chinese ideographs can be mastered only through rote learning and can be often forgotten because of disuse.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n== Information and communications technology (ICT) ==\nIn 2010, the Government of China released its medium and long term national [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in education master plans, which stated explicitly that ICT would have a historic impact on the development of education and called for a strong emphasis on [[Educational technology|ICT in education]]. In order to realize the scientific and orderly development of ICT in education, China has developed a holistic and top-down approach. The Ten Year Development Plan for ICT in Education 2011-2020 was formalized in 2012. It states that by 2020, all adults will have access to quality education resources in an ICT-enabling environment, an ICT support service system for the learning society will take shape, and all regions and schools at all levels will have broadband internet access.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002430/243076e.pdf|title=Leveraging information and communication technologies to achieve the Post-2015 Education goal: report of the International Conference on ICT and Post-2015 Education|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=11\u201312|access-date=May 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215123717/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002430/243076E.pdf|archive-date=December 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn order to considerably enhance Internet coverage and transmission capacity, China has accelerated its drive to upgrade infrastructure, including the China Education and Research Network (CERNet) and China Education Broadband Satellite (CEBSat), which are the two main education networks.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nTo enhance the impact of ICT in education and teaching, China has placed a strong focus on developing quality digital educational resources.

A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities is one of the main culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me.</blockquote> In ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are \"shortchanged\" in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/in-chinese-schools-disabled-get-shortchanged.html?_r=0 |title=In Chinese Schools, Disabled Get Shortchanged |last=Farrar |first=Lara |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209010302/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/in-chinese-schools-disabled-get-shortchanged.html?_r=0 |archive-date=February 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== School uniforms ==\nMany schools in China require the use of a school uniform until college.<ref name=\"UniformDesign2011\">{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Miao|last2=He|first2=Xin|date=2 September 2011|title=Design and Development of Chinese Primary and Secondary New Type School Uniform|journal=Advanced Materials Research|volume=331|pages=679\u2013682|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.331.679|issn=1662-8985}}</ref> Students have uniforms for both sportswear and their daily uniform, both of which will change depending on the season.<ref name=\"UniformDesign2011\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/07/class-acts/|title=Class Act|last=Dawson|first=David|date=17 July 2017|website=The World of Chinese|access-date=October 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030002548/http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/07/class-acts/|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Uniforms can also differ in design depending on the school, making it easy for people to identify which school a student attends.<ref name=\"edu.gog.cn\" /> Proponents of school uniforms argue that the uniforms are a unique form of culture, remove the pressure of students comparing clothing, and allow the faculty and others to identify students and their respective schools.<ref name=\"edu.gog.cn\">{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gog.cn/system/2016/10/13/015161532.shtml|title=\u5b66\u6821\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u6c42\u5b66\u751f\u7a7f\u6821\u670d\uff0c\u539f\u6765\u4f5c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a!|website=edu.gog.cn|access-date=2018-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028225805/http://edu.gog.cn/system/2016/10/13/015161532.shtml|archive-date=October 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In an article for ''[[China Daily]]'', Yuan Can states that while student uniforms were previously regarded as a sign of progress, in current society the uniform's style is seen as more important by many students than a sense of identity and belonging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0430/c98649-8886161.html|title=Evolution of school uniforms in China|last1=Can|first1=Yuan|date=|website=People's Daily Online|accessdate=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115193931/http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0430/c98649-8886161.html|archive-date=November 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Rural education==\n{{see also|Rural boarding schools in China|Hukou system}}\nReflecting the fact that most of China's population lives in the countryside, 95.2 percent of all elementary schools, 87.6 percent of junior high schools and 71.5 percent of senior high schools are in rural areas, with 160 million students at the compulsory education stage. The 1995-2000 \"National Project of Compulsory Education in Impoverished Areas\" involved the allocation of 3.9 billion special funds from the central finance and 10 billion yuan raised by local governments to improve schooling conditions in impoverished areas. In 2004, various special funds allocated by the central finance for compulsory education in rural areas reached 10 billion yuan, a 72.4 percent increase on the 2003 figure of 5.8 billion.\n\nThe [[China Agricultural Broadcast and Television School]] has nearly 3,000 branch schools and a teaching and administrative staff of 46,000. Using radio, television, satellite, network, audio and video materials, it has trained over 100 million people in applicable agricultural technologies and over 8 million persons for work in rural areas.

Providing an alternative, private entrepreneurs established since the 1990s semi-official private schools that offered schooling to migrant children for lower fees. However, this system contributed to the segregation between urban and migrant children. Furthermore, these schools often have a poor teaching quality, provide only school certificates of limited value and sometimes even do not comply with safety regulations.<ref>Goodburn, C (2009): Learning from Migrant Education: A case study of the schooling of rural migrant children in Beijing.

However, the emphasis of English education only emerged after 1979 when the Cultural Revolution ended, China adopted the Open Door Policy, and the United States and China established strong diplomatic ties. An estimate of the number of English speakers in China is over 200 million and rising, with 50 million secondary school children now studying the language.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Bo\n|last=Qu\n|publisher=Routledge\n|issn=1358-684X\n|title=Changing English: Studies in Culture & Education\n|journal=Changing English\n|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=19&sid=8a6cf0ea-21ad-4a6f-a6bf-c2fe96aa4669%40sessionmgr15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=aph&AN=27625561\n|date=December 2007\n}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn China, most school children are taught their first English lesson at the age of 10. Despite the early learning of English, there is widespread criticism of the teaching and learning of the language. Schools in China are evaluated and financed based on test results. This causes teaching to be geared towards the skills tested. Students focus on rote-memorization (written and oral repetition) as the main learning strategy. These methods, which fit very well with the Chinese way of learning, have been criticized as fundamentally flawed by Western educationalists and linguists.<ref name=\"Qing Ma and Peter Kelly 2009\">{{citation\n|author=Qing Ma and Peter Kelly\n|publisher=Routledge\n|issn=1358-684X\n|title=Overcoming Hurdles to Chinese Students' Learning of English Lexis\n|journal=Changing English\n|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=8a6cf0ea-21ad-4a6f-a6bf-c2fe96aa4669%40sessionmgr15&vid=2&hid=19\n|date=December 2009\n}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nFurthermore, newly learned words are seldom put into use. This arises because everyone in China communicates through Mandarin or a regional Chinese dialect, and English is perceived to be of little use in the country. This has been further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination where 80% of the test is the writing component, 20% is devoted to listening, and speaking is excluded entirely. According to a national survey, only half of the teachers consider that vocabulary should be learned through conversation or communication. A far smaller percentage support activities such as role playing or vocabulary games.<ref name=\"Qing Ma and Peter Kelly 2009\"/>\n\nAccording to research completed by [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2017, less than 1 percent of people in China speak English conversationally.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-english-speaking-countries/ |website=Telegraph |date=9 February 2017 |access-date=3 December 2018 |quote=Around 10 million people - in a total population of 1.3 billion - speak English.
