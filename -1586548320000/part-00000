He played as a [[defensive midfielder]] for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, such as [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], as well as [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. Nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" by former France teammate [[Eric Cantona]], Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a [[France national football team|French]] international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three [[UEFA European Football Championships]] and one [[FIFA World Cup]], captaining his nation to victories in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn addition to winning two [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1991 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] squad that became the first, and so far only, [[Football in France|French]] club to win the [[UEFA Champions League]], a feat which the team achieved in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]]; with the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League]] victory, Deschamps became the [[Captain (association football)|youngest captain]] ever to lead his team to win the title. With [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], as well as three [[Serie A]] titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the [[1999\u20132000 FA Cup]], and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001]], before retiring later that season.

During the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], he helped his former club Juventus win the [[Serie B]] title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the [[2006 Calciopoli Scandal]] the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the [[2009\u201310 Ligue 1|2009\u201310]] season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive [[Troph\u00e9e des Champions]] titles in [[2010 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|2010]] and [[2011 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|2011]]. On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the [[France national football team|French national team]], leading the team to the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and he won the final of [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] beating [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 4\u20132. After France's victory at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Deschamps became the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager; alongside [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] and [[Franz Beckenbauer]], following Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain.<ref name=\"World Cup as a manager and player\">{{cite news |title=Who has won the World Cup as a manager and player? |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/07/15/world-cup-wins-manager-player-zagallo-beckenbauer-deschamps |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Sports Illustrated |date=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Club===\n[[File:Didier Deschamps.jpg|thumb|right|Deschamps in 2000.]]\n\nDeschamps was born in [[Bayonne]] in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] area. After a short passage at rugby in the [[Biarritz Olympique]] club, Deschamps started his football career at an amateur club, [[Aviron Bayonnais (football)|Aviron Bayonnais]] whilst still at school. His potential was spotted by scouts from [[FC Nantes Atlantique|Nantes]], for whom he signed in April 1983. Deschamps made his league debut on 27 September 1985. He transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1989. Deschamps then spent a season on loan with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in 1990, before returning to Marseille. In this second spell with Marseille, Deschamps gained his first honours as a professional player, winning two [[Ligue 1|French league]] titles in 1991 and 1992, and was a member of the first and currently only [[Football in France|French]] side to win the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]], becoming the youngest captain ever to lift the trophy in the process.<ref name=\"candidates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9271406/Early-candidates-in-the-frame-to-take-over-from-Kenny-Dalglish-at-Liverpool.html |title=Early candidates in the frame to take over from Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=Alice Philipson |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Deschamps joined Italian club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], with whom he won three [[Serie A]] titles, one [[Coppa Italia]], two [[Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Supercups]], as well as his second [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League title]], an [[UEFA Super Cup]], and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in 1996; he also reached two more Champions League finals in his next two seasons, and an [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final in 1995]]. After his spell with Juventus, Deschamps spent a season in England with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning the [[FA Cup]], and scoring once against [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-champions-league--chelseas-big-night-is-spoiled-by-sutton-1123414.html|title=Chelsea's big night is spoiled by Sutton|work=The Independent|date=3 November 1999|accessdate=6 November 2009|first=Glenn|last=Moore}}</ref> He finished his playing career in Spain, spending a season with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], helping them to the [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final]], but he remained on the bench as they lost to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He then retired in the middle of 2001, only 32 years old.\n\n===International===\nReceiving his first international call-up from [[Michel Platini]] on 29 April 1989 against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the [[France national football team|French team]] as they failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in both 1990 and 1994, also suffering a first-round elimination at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].\n\nWhen new team coach [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] began to rebuild the team for [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]], he initially selected [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] star [[Eric Cantona]] as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], and [[David Ginola]] being dropped in favour of younger players such as [[Zinedine Zidane]]. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the \"Golden Generation\". He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].\n\nIn 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, a feat emulated and surpassed by the [[Spain national football team]] between 2008-2012. Following the tournament, Deschamps announced his retirement from international football, making his second last appearance in a ceremonial match against a [[FIFA]] XI in August 2000, which resulted in 5\u20131 victory. His final appearance was against [[England national football team|England]]. At the time of his retirement Deschamps held the record for the most appearances for France, though this has since been surpassed by [[Marcel Desailly]], [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Lilian Thuram]]. In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals.\n\nDeschamps was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Style of play==\nIn his position, Deschamps primarily excelled at impeding the opposition's attacking movements as a defensive midfielder, and was capable of subsequently starting up attacking plays and distributing the ball to teammates once he won back possession, leading to him being derisively nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" by former France teammate Eric Cantona, who implied that Deschamps's primary contribution to the national team was to retrieve the ball and pass it forward to \"more talented\" players.<ref name= water-carrier>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/deschamps-the-water-carrier-is-now-monacos-man-of-ideas-71454.html|title=Football: Deschamps: the water carrier is now Monaco's man of ideas|work=The Independent|date=28 February 2004|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=profile>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744844.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Didier Deschamps|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"come Giannichedda non c'e' nessuno\">{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1997/dicembre/04/all_Udinese_come_Giannichedda_non_ga_0_9712048347.shtml|title=all' Udinese come Giannichedda non c' e' nessuno|trans-title=At Udinese there's no-one like Giannichedda|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Meroi Massimo|date=4 December 1997|accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> Deschamps's ability to perform this role was made possible due to his high work-rate, tenacity, stamina, vision, reliable distribution and technique, and his efficacy at pressing and tackling opponents.

Deschamps' first game in charge of Juventus was highly successful since Juventus beat [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]] 8\u20130 in a friendly, but poor results followed as Juventus was knocked out in the [[2006\u201307 Coppa Italia|3rd round of the Coppa Italia]] and then drew 1\u20131 against [[A.C. Rimini 1912|Rimini]] on the first day of the league season. In the following three matches, Juventus beat [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] 2\u20131, [[F.C. Crotone|Crotone]] 3\u20130 and [[Modena F.C.|Modena]] 4\u20130. Deschamps also helped Juventus to win their first competition since being relegated, which was the [[Birra Moretti Cup]] in which Juventus beat [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] 1\u20130 and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. He led Juventus to its return to [[Serie A]], which was confirmed on 19 May 2007 with a 5\u20131 away win at [[A.C. Arezzo|Arezzo]].

In this system, Matuidi proved to be equally effective, in spite of his unorthodox playing role, as he was able to track back and limit the attacking threat of the opposing full-backs on the flank. Moreover, he also often tucked into the centre, in order to help support [[Paul Pogba]] and [[N'Golo Kant\u00e9]] defensively, which also helped minimise the amount of space given to the main playmakers of France's opponents throughout the tournament, and ultimately helped to nullify their impact on the game in midfield. Furthermore, Matuidi's more defensive role on the left flank provided balance within the team, as it in turn gave [[Kylian Mbapp\u00e9]] the licence to attack and run at defences from the right wing.<ref name=\"platform\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018-france-vs-argentina-blaise-matuidi-kylian-mbappe-lionel-messi-a8426281.html |title=World Cup 2018: How Blaise Matuidi laid the platform for Kylian Mbappe to put in the performance of the tournament |publisher=The Independent |author1=Michael Cox |date=2 July 2018 |accessdate=11 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018-france-vs-belgium-analysis-nacer-chadli-exposed-defence-attack-tactics-a8441666.html |title=World Cup 2018: How France exposed Nacer Chadli and turned defence into attack to nullify Belgium\u2019s flair |publisher=The Independent |author1=Michael Cox |date=11 July 2018 |accessdate=11 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.squawka.com/en/news/blaise-matudi-starts-left-wing-as-didier-deschamps-names-odd-side-to-face-peru/1043089#W71VxybS5jwFfELX.97 |title=Blaise Matudi starts left-wing as Didier Deschamps names odd side to face Peru |publisher=www.squawka.com |author1=Steve Jennings |date=21 June 2018 |accessdate=11 July 2018 }}</ref> Following these matches, France became World Cup winners after beating Belgium 1\u20130 in the semi-final<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44692297 |title=France 1-0 Belgium |publisher=BBC Sport |author1=Shamoon Hafez |date=10 June 2018 |accessdate=10 June 2018 }}</ref> and Croatia 4\u20132 in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"McNulty1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44754965|title=France 4\u20132 Croatia|publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2018|access-date=15 July 2018|last=McNulty|first=Phil}}</ref> As such, Deschamps became only the third man after M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, and only the second captain after Beckenbauer to do so.<ref name=\"World Cup as a manager and player\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nDeschamps married his girlfriend Claude Antoinette in 1989.

born 15 October 1968) is a French retired [[Association football|footballer]] who has been manager of the [[France national football team|France national team]] since 2012. He played as a [[defensive midfielder]] for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, such as [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], as well as [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. Nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" by former France teammate [[Eric Cantona]], Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a [[France national football team|French]] international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three [[UEFA European Football Championships]] and one [[FIFA World Cup]], captaining his nation to victories in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn addition to winning two [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1991 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] squad that became the first, and so far only, [[Football in France|French]] club to win the [[UEFA Champions League]], a feat which the team achieved in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]]; with the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League]] victory, Deschamps became the [[Captain (association football)|youngest captain]] ever to lead his team to win the title. With [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], as well as three [[Serie A]] titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the [[1999\u20132000 FA Cup]], and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001]], before retiring later that season. After [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and followed by [[Iker Casillas]], he was only the second captain in the history of football to have lifted the Champions League trophy, the World Cup trophy, and the European Championship trophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/deschamps-and-his-water-carriers |title=World Cup 2018: Didier Deschamps and his water carriers |publisher=www.sportskeeda.com |date=4 July 2018 |accessdate=16 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nAs a manager, Deschamps began his career with [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], and helped the club to win the [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final|Coupe de la Ligue]] in 2003, and reached the [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final]], being named [[Troph\u00e9es UNFP du football|Ligue 1 Manager of the Year]] in 2004. During the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], he helped his former club Juventus win the [[Serie B]] title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the [[2006 Calciopoli Scandal]] the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the [[2009\u201310 Ligue 1|2009\u201310]] season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive [[Troph\u00e9e des Champions]] titles in [[2010 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|2010]] and [[2011 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|2011]]. On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the [[France national football team|French national team]], leading the team to the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and he won the final of [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] beating [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 4\u20132. After France's victory at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Deschamps became the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager; alongside [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]] and [[Franz Beckenbauer]], following Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain.<ref name=\"World Cup as a manager and player\">{{cite news |title=Who has won the World Cup as a manager and player? |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/07/15/world-cup-wins-manager-player-zagallo-beckenbauer-deschamps |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Sports Illustrated |date=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Didier Deschamps.jpg|thumb|right|Deschamps in 2000.]]\n\nDeschamps was born in [[Bayonne]] in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] area. After a short passage at rugby in the [[Biarritz Olympique]] club, Deschamps started his football career at an amateur club, [[Aviron Bayonnais (football)|Aviron Bayonnais]] whilst still at school. His potential was spotted by scouts from [[FC Nantes Atlantique|Nantes]], for whom he signed in April 1983. Deschamps made his league debut on 27 September 1985. He transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1989. Deschamps then spent a season on loan with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in 1990, before returning to Marseille. In this second spell with Marseille, Deschamps gained his first honours as a professional player, winning two [[Ligue 1|French league]] titles in 1991 and 1992, and was a member of the first and currently only [[Football in France|French]] side to win the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]], becoming the youngest captain ever to lift the trophy in the process.<ref name=\"candidates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9271406/Early-candidates-in-the-frame-to-take-over-from-Kenny-Dalglish-at-Liverpool.html |title=Early candidates in the frame to take over from Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=Alice Philipson |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Deschamps joined Italian club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], with whom he won three [[Serie A]] titles, one [[Coppa Italia]], two [[Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Supercups]], as well as his second [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League title]], an [[UEFA Super Cup]], and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in 1996; he also reached two more Champions League finals in his next two seasons, and an [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final in 1995]]. After his spell with Juventus, Deschamps spent a season in England with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning the [[FA Cup]], and scoring once against [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-champions-league--chelseas-big-night-is-spoiled-by-sutton-1123414.html|title=Chelsea's big night is spoiled by Sutton|work=The Independent|date=3 November 1999|accessdate=6 November 2009|first=Glenn|last=Moore}}</ref> He finished his playing career in Spain, spending a season with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], helping them to the [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final]], but he remained on the bench as they lost to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He then retired in the middle of 2001, only 32 years old.\n\n==International career==\nReceiving his first international call-up from [[Michel Platini]] on 29 April 1989 against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the [[France national football team|French team]] as they failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in both 1990 and 1994, also suffering a first-round elimination at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].\n\nWhen new team coach [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] began to rebuild the team for [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]], he initially selected [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] star [[Eric Cantona]] as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], and [[David Ginola]] being dropped in favour of younger players such as [[Zinedine Zidane]]. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the \"Golden Generation\". He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].\n\nIn 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, a feat emulated and surpassed by the [[Spain national football team]] between 2008-2012. Following the tournament, Deschamps announced his retirement from international football, making his second last appearance in a ceremonial match against a [[FIFA]] XI in August 2000, which resulted in 5\u20131 victory. His final appearance was against [[England national football team|England]]. At the time of his retirement Deschamps held the record for the most appearances for France, though this has since been surpassed by [[Marcel Desailly]], [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Lilian Thuram]]. In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals.\n\nDeschamps was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Style of play==\nIn his position, Deschamps primarily excelled at impeding the opposition's attacking movements as a defensive midfielder, and was capable of subsequently starting up attacking plays and distributing the ball to teammates once he won back possession, leading to him being derisively nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" by former France teammate Eric Cantona, who implied that Deschamps's primary contribution to the national team was to retrieve the ball and pass it forward to \"more talented\" players.<ref name= water-carrier>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/deschamps-the-water-carrier-is-now-monacos-man-of-ideas-71454.html|title=Football: Deschamps: the water carrier is now Monaco's man of ideas|work=The Independent|date=28 February 2004|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=profile>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744844.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Didier Deschamps|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"come Giannichedda non c'e' nessuno\">{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1997/dicembre/04/all_Udinese_come_Giannichedda_non_ga_0_9712048347.shtml|title=all' Udinese come Giannichedda non c' e' nessuno|trans-title=At Udinese there's no-one like Giannichedda|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Meroi Massimo|date=4 December 1997|accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> Deschamps's ability to perform this role was made possible due to his high work-rate, tenacity, stamina, vision, reliable distribution and technique, and his efficacy at pressing and tackling opponents.

He was appointed head coach of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in [[France]]'s [[Ligue 1]], leading them to the [[Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue title]] [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final|in 2003]] and to its first [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final|final in 2004]].

Deschamps' first game in charge of Juventus was highly successful since Juventus beat [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]] 8\u20130 in a friendly, but poor results followed as Juventus was knocked out in the [[2006\u201307 Coppa Italia|3rd round of the Coppa Italia]] and then drew 1\u20131 against [[A.C. Rimini 1912|Rimini]] on the first day of the league season. In the following three matches, Juventus beat [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] 2\u20131, [[F.C. Crotone|Crotone]] 3\u20130 and [[Modena F.C.|Modena]] 4\u20130.

Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.\n\nThe majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data, known as attributes, over a low energy link.<ref>Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]</ref> The [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is an exception to this rule, being based on the General Access Profile (GAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Mesh profiles ===\nBluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network.

Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices with low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] have introduced their Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets over the last few years. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company, [[Aislelabs]], reported that peripherals, such as proximity beacons, usually function for 1\u20132 years with a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With the newer chipsets and advances in software, both Android and iOS phones now have negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report \u2013 Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-10|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>) is a [[Personal area network|wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |title=beacons |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074548/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> security, and home entertainment industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref> Compared to [[Bluetooth|Classic Bluetooth]], Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a [[#Radio_interface|similar communication range]].

Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices with low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] have introduced their Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets over the last few years. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company, [[Aislelabs]], reported that peripherals, such as proximity beacons, usually function for 1\u20132 years with a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With the newer chipsets and advances in software, both Android and iOS phones now have negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report \u2013 Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n", "name_user": "Nak2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "More specific introduction to BLE", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy"}

He is recorded by [[Fordun]], in his ''Scotichronicon'', and in ''Extracta ex variis Cronicis Scocie'' as \"Robertus de Lavedir 'the good'\"\n\n==Early mentions==\nThe eldest son of Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass (d. September 1337) by his wife Elizabeth (d. before 1358), he was probably born about 1310 and is described in Rymer's ''Foedera'' (vol.iii, p.&nbsp;1022) as the eldest son of Sir Robert de Lawedre, one of the Scottish Ambassadors in 1323 who had been sent to negotiate peace with England. This Robert ''fils'' was attached to the train as a page.\n\nIn a charter in the ''Calendar of the Laing Charters, A.D. 854 - 1837'' (page  10, number 32) there is a Precept originally written in Norman-French by Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of March, to Sir Robert de Lawedre, younger, (''le fitz'') for heritable [[sasine]] of the reversion of the lands of Whitelaw within the Earldom of Dunbar, plus 10 livres yearly from the mill of Dunbar, and the farms and issues of the granter's said town ('ville') of Dunbar, according to the terms of charters to the grantee. Dated at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], 20 October 1324.\n\n==Career and estates==\n\nIn 1328 he was appointed [[Justiciar]]y of 'that part of Scotland on the North side of the Water of Forth,' his main estate being close to [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] in the province of [[Moray]]. The ''Exchequer Rolls'' record that  \"Roberto de Lawedir de Moravia, knight\", received annual fees from the Exchequer in 1329.  Thirty five years later, on 1 October 1363, in a charter of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] (no.163), King [[David II of Scotland|David II]] confirmed a pension of \u00a320 per annum upon the ageing \"Robert de Lawedre, militi,\" from this post.\n\nLachlan Shaw writes \"the first proprietor of Quarrelwood, of whom we have any distinct account, is Sir Robert Lauder or Lavedre. His father, also Sir Robert, was Justiciary of Lothians, and Ambassador to England in the time of King Robert Bruce, and engaged in similar service for King David Bruce. Both father and son seem to have been present at the [[battle of Halidon Hill]], on 20 July 1333, after which fatal event the younger Sir Robert, being Justiciary of the North, hastened to occupy the Castle of Urquhart on [[Loch Ness]], one of the few fortalices which held out against the power of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] of England. He held the lands of Quarrelwood, Grieshop, Brightmoney, and Kinsteary, which continued to be possessed by his descendants, in the female line, for many generations. He designated himself as 'Robertus de Lavadre, Dominus de Quarrelwood, in Moravia.'

This Robert ''fils'' was attached to the train as a page.\n\nIn a charter in the ''Calendar of the Laing Charters, A.D. 854 - 1837'' (page  10, number 32) there is a Precept originally written in Norman-French by Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of March, to Sir Robert de Lawedre, younger, (''le fitz'') for heritable [[sasine]] of the reversion of the lands of Whitelaw within the Earldom of Dunbar, plus 10 livres yearly from the mill of Dunbar, and the farms and issues of the granter's said town ('ville') of Dunbar, according to the terms of charters to the grantee.

The ''Exchequer Rolls'' record that  \"Roberto de Lawedir de Moravia, knight\", received annual fees from the Exchequer in 1329.  Thirty five years later, on 1 October 1363, in a charter of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] (no.163), King [[David II of Scotland|David II]] confirmed a pension of \u00a320 per annum upon the ageing \"Robert de Lawedre, militi,\" from this post.\n\nLachlan Shaw writes \"the first proprietor of Quarrelwood, of whom we have any distinct account, is Sir Robert Lauder or Lavedre.

Both father and son seem to have been present at the [[battle of Halidon Hill]], on 20 July 1333, after which fatal event the younger Sir Robert, being Justiciary of the North, hastened to occupy the Castle of Urquhart on [[Loch Ness]], one of the few fortalices which held out against the power of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] of England.

Across the world and to varying degrees, cinemas and [[movie theater]]s have been closed, festivals have been cancelled or postponed, and film releases have been moved to future dates or delayed indefinitely.

Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] originally scheduled to be released between March and November were postponed or canceled around the world, with film productions also halted.\n\nThe Chinese film industry had lost {{USD|2 billion}} by March 2020, having closed all its cinemas during the Lunar New Year period that sustains the industry across Asia. The United States saw its lowest box office weekend since 1998 between March 13\u201315.
