Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic \u2014 the French called it \"sabotage\" \u2014 won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 152.</ref><ref>Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|any withdrawal of efficiency]], including the [[slowdown]], the [[strike action|strike]], [[working to rule]], or creative bungling of job assignments.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages&nbsp;196\u2013197.</ref> [[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\" quoting W.D.

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term [[eco-terrorist]] when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the [[monkey wrench]] thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by [[Edward Abbey]] in the novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.\n\nFrom 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or [[Earth Liberation Front]] engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.<ref>[[Earth Liberation Front]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}</ref>  ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front|work=targetofopportunity.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/Bari/TreeSpiking1|title=The Secret History of Tree Spiking \u2013 Part 1|work=iww.org}}</ref>\n\n== As war tactic ==\n[[File:\"WARNING FROM THE FBI\" - NARA - 516039.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] poster from the United States]]\n\nIn war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agent]] or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or [[logistics|logistic]] routes.

A more recent case may be the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment.

Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and [[reprisal]]. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \"human element\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \"human element\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=1\u20132|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\nThere are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \"General Interference with Organizations and Production\":\n\n* When possible, refer all matters to committees for \"further study and consideration\". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never fewer than five\n* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.\n* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\n* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.\n* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw.  Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.\n* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.  Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.\n* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.\n* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on.  See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.\n* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.\n\nFrom the section entitled, \"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \"Act stupid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=28\u201331|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===\nThe United States [[Office of Strategic Services]], later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \"...&nbsp;slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the [[United Nations]] War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|page=2|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== In World War I ===\nOn 30 July 1916, the [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in their fight.\n\nOn 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, [[Kingsland Explosion|set fire to his workbench]] at an ammunition assembly plant near [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages.

Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the [[BBC radio]] or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943.

A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Borrowed into Japanese ===\nIn Japanese, the verb [[Gairaigo#Grammatical function|saboru]] (\u30b5\u30dc\u308b) means to skip school or loaf on the job.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Birth control sabotage]]\n* [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]\n* [[Cichociemni]]\n* [[Colin Gubbins]]\n* [[Direct action]]\n* [[Espionage]]\n* [[Fifth column]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Guerrilla warfare]]\n* [[Industrial espionage]]\n* [[Kedyw]]\n* [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]\n* [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]]\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Setting up to fail]]\n* [[Social undermining]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]]\n* [[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]]\n* [[Terrorism]]\n* ''[[The Mole (TV series)|The Mole]]'', TV series\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[\u00c9mile Pouget]], ''Le sabotage; notes et postface de Gr\u00e9goire Chamayou et Mathieu Triclot'', 1913; Mille et une nuit, 2004; English translation, ''Sabotage'', paperback, 112 pp., University Press of the Pacific, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89875-459-3}}.\n* Pasquinelli, Matteo.

One who engages in sabotage is a ''saboteur''. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions.\n\nAny unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage. Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke, or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage.\n\n{{Anchor|ety}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nA [[Folk etymology|popular but false]] account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that poor workers in France, who wore wooden shoes called {{lang|fr|sabots}}, used to throw them into the machines to disrupt production.<ref name=\"etymonline\"/> This origin story is told in the 1991 movie [[Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country|Star Trek VI]]. This account is not supported by the etymology.<ref name=\"etymonline\"/> Rather, the French source word literally means to \"walk noisily\", as was done by sabot-wearing labourers, who interrupted production by means of labor disputes, not damage.<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sabotage |title=Sabotage  |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nOne of its first appearances in French literature is in the ''Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou mani\u00e8res de parler usit\u00e9es parmi le peuple'' of D'Hautel, edited in 1808.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=D'Hautel |first=Charles-Louis |date=1808 |title=Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou mani\u00e8res de parler usit\u00e9es parmi le peuple |trans-title=Dictionary of slang or ways to speak used by the people |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zT5p4cMNoWgC&pg=Pa325 |language=fr |page=325 |publisher=D'Hautel et Schoell |quote=Saboteur : Sobriquet injurieux qu'on donne \u00e0 un mauvais ouvrier, qui fait tout \u00e0 la h\u00e2te, et malproprement.}}</ref>\n\nThe verb \"saboter\" is also found in 1873\u20131874 in the ''Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise'' of [[\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite book |first=\u00c9mile |last=Littr\u00e9 |title=Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise |trans-title=Dictionary of the French language|publisher=Hachette |date=1873\u20131874 |page=1790 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54066991/f401}}</ref> But it is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of \"deliberately and maliciously destroying property\" or \"working slower\".

Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic \u2014 the French called it \"sabotage\" \u2014 won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 152.</ref><ref>Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|any withdrawal of efficiency]], including the [[slowdown]], the [[strike action|strike]], [[working to rule]], or creative bungling of job assignments.<ref>Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages&nbsp;196\u2013197.</ref> [[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\" quoting W.D.

The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, [[Bechtel]] Corporation.<ref>Rinehart, J.W.

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term [[eco-terrorist]] when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the [[monkey wrench]] thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by [[Edward Abbey]] in the novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.\n\nFrom 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or [[Earth Liberation Front]] engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.<ref>[[Earth Liberation Front]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}</ref>  ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front|work=targetofopportunity.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/Bari/TreeSpiking1|title=The Secret History of Tree Spiking \u2013 Part 1|work=iww.org}}</ref>\n\n== As war tactic ==\n[[File:\"WARNING FROM THE FBI\" - NARA - 516039.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] poster from the United States]]\n\nIn war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agent]] or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or [[logistics|logistic]] routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of [[Black Tom explosion|Black Tom]] and the [[Kingsland Explosion]].

For example, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) is alleged to have [[Siberian pipeline sabotage|sabotaged a Siberian pipeline]] during the [[Cold War]], using information from the [[Farewell Dossier]]. A more recent case may be the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]] by the [[United States]], [[Israel]] or, according to the latest news, even [[Russia]].<ref>Markoff, John, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/science/13stuxnet.html?scp=1&sq=Malware%20Aimed%20At%20Iran%20Hit%20Five%20Sites,%20Report%20Says&st=cse Malware Aimed at Iran Hit Five Sites, Report Says]\", ''[[New York Times]]'', 13 February 2011, p. 15.</ref>\n\nSabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin.

Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and [[reprisal]]. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \"human element\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \"human element\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=1\u20132|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\nThere are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \"General Interference with Organizations and Production\":\n\n* When possible, refer all matters to committees for \"further study and consideration\". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never fewer than five\n* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.\n* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\n* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.\n* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw.  Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.\n* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.  Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.\n* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.\n* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on.  See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.\n* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.\n\nFrom the section entitled, \"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \"Act stupid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=28\u201331|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===\nThe United States [[Office of Strategic Services]], later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \"...&nbsp;slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the [[United Nations]] War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|page=2|date=17 January 1944}}</ref>\n\n=== In World War I ===\nOn 30 July 1916, the [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in their fight.\n\nOn 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, [[Kingsland Explosion|set fire to his workbench]] at an ammunition assembly plant near [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages.

The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool.

The Home Army's sabotage operations [[Operation Wieniec|Operation Garland]] and [[Operation Belt|Operation Ribbon]] are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars \"wagony\", and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the rail roads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports.<ref>[[Home Army#Major operations]]</ref> As for Stalin's proxies, their actions lead to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The [[Gwardia Ludowa]] destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans.\n\nThe [[French Resistance]] ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the [[BBC radio]] or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three times the number of locomotives damaged by Allied air power.<ref name=\"Howard L.

After repeated failures in Allied bombing attempts to hit the factory, a team of French Resistance fighters and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) agents distracted the German guards with a game of soccer while part of their team entered the plant and destroyed machinery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies : Spies, Counterspies, and Saboteurs in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=83}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, the Germans ran a [[false flag]] sabotage infiltration, [[Operation Greif]], which was commanded by [[Waffen-SS]] [[commando]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. German [[commando]]s, wearing [[United States Army uniforms in World War II|US Army uniforms]], carrying [[US Army]] weapons, and using US Army vehicles, penetrated US lines to spread panic and confusion among US troops and to blow up bridges, [[ammunition dump]]s, and fuel stores and to disrupt the lines of communication. Many of the commandos were captured by the Americans. Because they were wearing US uniforms, a number of the Germans were executed as spies, either [[Summary execution|summarily]] or after [[military commissions]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ardennes, 1944: Peiper and Skorzeny |author=Jean-Paul Pallud |date=28 May 1987 |page=15 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-85045-740-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:PalestineRailways-1946-sabotage-JaffaJerusalem-1.jpg|thumb|[[Palestine Railway]]'s K class 2-8-4T steam locomotive and freight train on the Jaffa and Jerusalem line after being sabotaged by [[Jewish]] paramilitary forces in 1946.]]\n\nFrom 1948 to 1960, the Malayan Communists committed numerous effective acts of sabotage against the British Colonial authorities, first targeting railway bridges, then hitting larger targets such as military camps. Most of their efforts were centered around crippling [[Malaysia]]'s colonial economy and involved sabotage against trains, rubber trees, water pipes, and electric lines. The Communist's sabotage efforts were so successful that they caused backlash amongst the Malaysian population, who gradually withdrew support for the Communist movement as their livelihoods became threatened.<ref>{{cite book|last=Report prepared by the Historical Evaluation and Research Organization under contract for the Army Research Office|title=Isolating the Guerrilla: Classic and Basic Case Studies (Volume II)|year=1966|publisher=Historical Evaluation and Research Organization|location=Washington}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1945 to 1948, Jewish groups opposed British control. Though that control was to end according to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The [[Haganah]] focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The [[Stern Gang]] and the [[Irgun]] used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell-shocked Arab railway workers to strike. The [[6th Airborne Division]] was called in to provide security as a means of ending the strike.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== In Vietnam ===\nThe [[Viet Cong]] used swimmer saboteurs often and effectively during the [[Vietnam War]]. Between 1969 and 1970, swimmer saboteurs sunk, destroyed, or damaged 77 assets of the U.S. and its allies. Viet Cong swimmers were poorly equipped but well-trained and resourceful. The swimmers provided a low-cost/low-risk option with high payoff; possible loss to the country for failure compared to the possible gains from a successful mission led to the obvious conclusion the swimmer saboteurs were a good idea.<ref>{{cite book|last=<nowiki>Babyak, E.E., Jr., LtJG, USNM</nowiki>|title=Swimmer Sabotage or The Most Dangerous Mine|publisher=Naval Mine Warfare School|year=1971|isbn=|location=Charleston|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== During the Cold War ===\nOn 1 January 1984, the Cuscatlan bridge over [[Lempa river]] in [[El Salvador]], critical to flow of commercial and military traffic, was destroyed by guerrilla forces using explosives after using mortar fire to \"scatter\" the bridge's guards, causing an estimated $3.7 million in required repairs, and considerably impacting on El Salvadoran business and security.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGeorge II|first=Harvey J.|author2=Christine C.

For example, [[Klaus-Peter Sabotta]] sabotaged German railway lines in the late 1990s in an attempt to extort [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]10 million from the German railway operator [[Deutsche Bahn]]. He is now serving a sentence of [[life imprisonment]]. In 1989, ex-[[Scotland Yard]] detective Rodney Whitchelo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for spiking Heinz baby food products in supermarkets, in an extortion attempt on the food manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/food-scare-scandals-1100385.html|title=Food Scare Scandals|newspaper=The Independent|date=1999-06-16}}</ref>\n\n== As political action ==\n\nThe term political sabotage is sometimes used to define the acts of one political camp to disrupt, harass or damage the reputation of a political opponent, usually during an electoral campaign, such as during [[Watergate]]. [[Smear campaign]]s are a commonly used tactic.  The term could also describe the actions and expenditures of private entities, corporations and organizations against democratically approved or enacted laws, policies and programs.\n\nAfter the Cold War ended, the [[Mitrokhin Archives]] were declassified, which included detailed [[KGB]] plans of [[active measures]] to subvert politics in opposing nations.\n\n=== In a coup d'etat ===\nSabotage is a crucial tool of the successful [[coup d'etat]], which requires control of communications before, during, and after the coup is staged.  Simple sabotage against physical communications platforms using semi-skilled technicians, or even those trained only for this task, could effectively silence the target government of the coup, leaving the [[War of ideas|information battle space]] open to the dominance of the coup's leaders.  To underscore the effectiveness of sabotage, \"A single cooperative technician will be able temporarily to put out of action a [[radio station]] which would otherwise require a full-scale [[assault]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Luttwak|first=Edward|title=Coup d'Etat, a Practical Handbook|year=1968|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=London|isbn=0-674-17547-6|page=119}}</ref>\n\nRailroads, where strategically important to the regime the coup is against, are prime targets for sabotage\u2014if a section of the track is damaged entire portions of the transportation network can be stopped until it is fixed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luttwak|first=Edward|title=Coup d'Etat, a Practical Handbook|year=1968|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=London|isbn=0-674-17547-6|page=128}}</ref>\n\n== Derivative usages ==\n\n=== Sabotage radio ===\nA sabotage radio was a small [[two-way radio]] designed for use by [[resistance movement]]s in World War II, and after the war often used by [[exploration|expeditions]] and similar parties.\n\n=== Cybotage ===\nArquilla and Rondfeldt, in their work entitled ''Networks and Netwars'', differentiate their definition of \"[[netwar]]\" from a list of \"trendy synonyms\", including \"cybotage\", a portmanteau from the words \"sabotage\" and \"[[Internet-related prefixes|cyber]]\".  They dub the practitioners of cybotage \"cyboteurs\" and note while all cybotage is not netwar, some netwar is cybotage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networks and Netwars|year=2001|publisher=RAND|isbn=0-8330-3030-2|editor1=John Arquilla|editor2=David Ronfeldt|pages=[https://archive.org/details/networksnetwars00john/page/5 5\u20137]|url=https://archive.org/details/networksnetwars00john/page/5}}</ref>\n\n=== Counter-sabotage ===\nCounter-sabotage, defined by ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'', is \"counterintelligence designed to detect and counteract sabotage\". The [[United States Department of Defense]] definition, found in the ''Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'', is \"action designed to detect and counteract sabotage. See also [[counterintelligence]]\".\n\n==== In World War II ====\nDuring World War II, British subject [[Eddie Chapman]], trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British.  The German [[Abwehr]] entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company's main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber, but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission's completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Borrowed into Japanese ===\nIn Japanese, the verb [[Gairaigo#Grammatical function|saboru]] (\u30b5\u30dc\u308b) means to skip school or loaf on the job.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Birth control sabotage]]\n* [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]\n* [[Cichociemni]]\n* [[Colin Gubbins]]\n* [[Direct action]]\n* [[Espionage]]\n* [[Fifth column]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Guerrilla warfare]]\n* [[Industrial espionage]]\n* [[Kedyw]]\n* [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]\n* [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]]\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Setting up to fail]]\n* [[Social undermining]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]]\n* [[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]]\n* [[Terrorism]]\n* ''[[The Mole (TV series)|The Mole]]'', TV series\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[\u00c9mile Pouget]], ''Le sabotage; notes et postface de Gr\u00e9goire Chamayou et Mathieu Triclot'', 1913; Mille et une nuit, 2004; English translation, ''Sabotage'', paperback, 112 pp., University Press of the Pacific, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89875-459-3}}.\n* Pasquinelli, Matteo.

The delegation consisted of 91 athletes, all of whom were men, something which had not happened since the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games in Los Angeles]] and which has not happened since. Ironically, the flag bearer, a woman named [[Cristina Hardekopf]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/christina-hardekopf-1.html|title=Christina Hardekopf Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> was a [[Diving (sport)|diver]] but was not included in the delegation as a participating athlete. However, Jorge Somlay, a rower, participated as Argentina\u2019s youngest Olympic competitor at only 13 years old.\n\nThe Olympic team won two medals, one bronze and one silver, and five Olympic diplomas. They placed 27th in total medal count over 83 participating countries.\n\nThe silver medal was one in [[yachting]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=1960 United States Olympic Book|last=|first=|publisher=The United States Olympic Association|year=1961|isbn=|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=193}}</ref> and the bronze in [[boxing]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=1960 United States Olympic Book|last=|first=|publisher=The United States Olympic Association|year=1961|isbn=|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=99}}</ref> giving Argentina half of its medals and 3 out of five of its Olympic Diplomas (something which was usual until the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]).\n\nArgentina\u2019s performance in the games forms part of a period of scarce results, which was affected by scarce support for the Olympic Games by the state as well as other political reasons. Repeating what happened in the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Games]] in [[Melbourne]], Argentina did not win a single gold medal, and the two medals that they did win were far below their average winnings of 4-7 medals in all of the games from 1924-1952.

organized by the [[Argentine Olympic Committee]] ([[:es:Comit\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpico Argentino|Comit\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpico Argentino]]). The delegation consisted of 91 athletes, all of whom were men, something which had not happened since the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games in Los Angeles]] and which has not happened since. Ironically, the flag bearer, a woman named [[Cristina Hardekopf]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/christina-hardekopf-1.html|title=Christina Hardekopf Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> was a [[Diving (sport)|diver]] but was not included in the delegation as a participating athlete. However, Jorge Somlay, a rower, participated as Argentina\u2019s youngest Olympic competitor at only 13 years old.\n\nThe Olympic team won two medals, one bronze and one silver, and five Olympic diplomas. They placed 27th in total medal count over 83 participating countries.\n\nThe silver medal was one in [[yachting]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=1960 United States Olympic Book|last=|first=|publisher=The United States Olympic Association|year=1961|isbn=|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=193}}</ref> and the bronze in [[boxing]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=1960 United States Olympic Book|last=|first=|publisher=The United States Olympic Association|year=1961|isbn=|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=99}}</ref> giving Argentina half of its medals and 3 out of five of its Olympic Diplomas (something which was usual until the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]).\n\nArgentina\u2019s performance in the games forms part of a period of scarce results, which was affected by scarce support for the Olympic Games by the state as well as other political reasons. Repeating what happened in the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Games]] in [[Melbourne]], Argentina did not win a single gold medal, and the two medals that they did win were far below their average winnings of 4-7 medals in all of the games from 1924-1952. In 2004 Argentina\u2019s Olympic success recovered to the levels it had during the 1924-1952 period.\n\n==Medalists==\n{{main|1960 Summer Olympics medal table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

{"title_page": "Interactive voice response", "text_new": "{{Redirect|IVR}}\n\n'''Interactive voice response''' ('''IVR''') is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] tones input via a keypad. In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[[https://www.enjayworld.com/blog/cti-computer-telephony-integration/ computer telephony integration]]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects.

Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center.

In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[https://www.enjayworld.com/blog/cti-computer-telephony-integration/ telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Information and communication technologies for development|date=2019-03-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development&oldid=885920797|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn rural India, it is critical for farmers to obtain information early. Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

{"title_page": "Assassination of Haim Arlosoroff", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2012}}\n[[Haim Arlosoroff]] was assassinated on the night of Friday, June 16, 1933, as the left-wing [[Zionist]] leader was walking with his wife on the beach in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Initially believed to be carried out by his right-wing political enemies, the subsequent court case ended in acquittal for the two accused of the crime. A third man was acquitted early on of advising the two to commit the act. The case has never been definitively solved.\n\n==Political background==\nAt the time of the murder, the two primary opposing [[Zionist]] political parties in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] were the mainstream [[Mapai]], the left-wing Socialist party, and the opposing [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]], the right-wing nationalist party. The rift between the two sects evolved with the end of World War I and the ensuing British colonization of Palestine. Globally represented by the [[World Zionist Organization]] and by the Jewish [[Yishuv]] within domestic Palestine, Mapai, led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], encouraged mass Jewish immigration and continuous settling of the land. Its leadership found it essential to cooperate with the ruling [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. Adhering to a code of practical Zionism, the official position of the Zionist leadership found it vital to develop the physical land in order to stake a claim over it. The Revisionists, led by [[Vladimir (Ze\u2019ev) Jabotinsky]], relied on the principles of political Zionism. They saw it imperative to gain total control over the country before devoting power toward its material improvement. It promoted procurement of independence from the English Mandate as the sole means for reestablishing a Jewish homeland.<ref name=\"Kaplan2005\">{{cite book|first=Eran|last=Kaplan|title=The Jewish radical right: Revisionist Zionism and its ideological legacy|url=https://archive.org/details/jewishradicalrig00kapl|url-access=registration|accessdate=June 26, 2011|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20380-1}} p. 139</ref>\n\nCharging Mapai leaders with prejudices against non-adherents, the dissonance between the two groups sounded louder and more pronounced.<ref>Kaplan 2005, p. 5.</ref> The rift reached a climax when Mapai showed interest in negotiations with the Nazi government over German Jews' expedited immigration to Palestine. These negotiations were spearheaded by Arlosoroff, and he was in Germany regarding this matter the week before his murder. The Revisionists, especially its secret radical branch, [[Brit Habiryonim]], expressed extreme criticism in Mapai's willingness to confer with the Nazi government over German Jews' expedited emigration to Palestine.<ref name=\"Maoz 2000\">{{Cite web|last=Maoz|first=Asher|year=2000|title=Historical Adjudication: Courts of Law, Commissions of Inquiry, and \"Historical Truth\"|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html|publisher=Law and History Review|volume=18|issue=3|accessdate=May 31, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913063847/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html|archive-date=September 13, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==List of characters==\n===Haim Arlosoroff===\nZionist ideologue and activist. Born in 1899 in [[Romny]], [[Russian Empire]], he took pride in his Jewish identity at an early age, despite his family's assimilationist views. A Socialist Zionist, he was a leader in the German branch of [[Hapoel Hatzair]], and edited its print periodical. In 1924, he moved to Palestine; two years later, he was a Jewish Palestinian representative at the [[League of Nations]] conference. In 1930, he helped merge his own Hapoel Hatzair party with the [[Poale Zion]] party, thus forming a new Labor party called Mapai. At the time of his murder, he was the head of the political department of the [[Jewish Agency]] in Palestine. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote several treatises and essays on the topics of socialist Zionism and Jewish presence in Palestine.<ref name=\"Avineri1989\">{{cite book|first=Shlomo|last=Avineri|authorlink=Shlomo Avineri|title=Arlosoroff|year=1989|publisher=Peter Halban Publishers, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-870015-23-3}} pp. 1\u201310.</ref>\n\n===[[Avraham Stavsky]]===\nSuspect number 1, he was believed to have shined a flashlight into the eyes of Arlosoroff seconds before suspect number 2 fatally shot him.

In the fall of 1932, he heard [[Abba Ahimeir]], one of the leaders of the violent faction Brit Habiryonim, speak in Warsaw. When he moved to Palestine in March 1933, Ahimeir took him under his wing.<ref name=\"\u05d8\u05d1\u05ea\u05d41982\">{{cite book|last=Teveth|authorlink=Shabtai Teveth|first=Shabtai|script-title=he:\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7 \u05d0\u05e8\u05dc\u05d5\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1|trans-title=The Arlosoroff Murder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toMNAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=June 26, 2011|year=1982|publisher=Schoken|language=Hebrew}} pp. 10\u201316.</ref>\n\n===[[Ze'ev Rosenblatt]]===\nSuspect number 2, he was believed to have fatally shot Arlosoroff.

Born in 1897 in [[Belorussia|White Russia]], he emigrated to Palestine in 1912. He was first a member of HaPoel Hatzair, Arlosoroff's own Labor Zionist movement. He later became disillusioned, and in 1928 co-formed the rival Fascia-nationalist Revisionist faction with [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]] and [[Dr. Yehoshua Heschel Yaivin]]. He was the editor-in-chief of the party's newspaper, [[Hazit HaAm]]. In 1932, he co-founded Brit Habiryonim, a secret Revisionist branch devoted to taking more violent methods against the British.<ref>Teveth 1982, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\n===Sima Arlosoroff===\nWife of Arlosoroff.

In January 1934, while incarcerated in the Jerusalem Municipal jail on a murder charge, he admitted to the killing of Arlosoroff, with an accomplice.

The most important part was his meeting with [[Nazi]] officials in an effort to negotiate details of German Jews' property transfer to Palestine. While viewed by Mapai as a valuable measure to insure the assets of these Jews, this negotiation was hotly contested by the Revisionists, who believed that under no circumstances should deals be made with the Nazis.\n\nOn the morning of the day of his murder, June 16, Arlosoroff was in [[Jerusalem]] on business. He spent the morning at the offices of the Jewish Agency. Sima was meant to meet him there in the early afternoon, upon which they would return home to [[Tel Aviv]]. Sima was supposed to make plans as to their weekend activity; the couple wanted to get away from the city for a few days. When she arrived at the Agency, Arlosoroff told her that he would return home by himself later in the afternoon.\n\nWhen Arlosoroff came home at 5:15&nbsp;pm, the couple decided to stay in Tel Aviv for that night. At 8:30&nbsp;pm they ate dinner at the beachfront Kaete Dan hotel. At 9:30&nbsp;pm they finished dinner and went for a walk on the beach.\n\nThey walked North, towards the [[Yarkon River]]. According to Sima, at a certain point she felt that they were being followed by two men. Arlosoroff brushed off her worry, and they continued walking. When they got to the end of the shoreline, they turned back. They saw the two men whom Sima had been afraid of earlier, and let them pass by in front of them. Sima was closer to the sea; Arlosoroff was closer to the city.\n\nAt 10&nbsp;pm, the couple approached the two men. The bigger of the two suddenly shone a flashlight in Arlosoroff's face, and asked him for the time. Arlosoroff responded that they had no right to bother them; the man asked again. In the meantime, the smaller man made what was later described by Sima as an \"Oriental gesture\" and took out a gun. The larger man turned off his flashlight. The smaller man aimed the gun at Arlosoroff, and fired. He fell to the ground. The two men ran from the scene as Sima called for help.\n\nThree bystanders who heard her cries rushed Arlosoroff to the hospital. After drifting in and out of consciousness for three hours, he died at 12:45&nbsp;am on Saturday morning, June 17.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 7\u201311.</ref>\n\n==Police blotter==\nThe official suspect police blotter appeared in newspapers around the country on Saturday afternoon. It was based on Sima's eyewitness account:<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe one who held the flashlight: ''Suspect Number 1:'' Male, taller than average, large build, age 30\u201340, clean-shaven, full face, light-skinned, tough expression, brownish-reddish hair, stands with legs apart, has a duck-like walk.

We think that he is wearing a gray hat and shoes. He makes Oriental movements with his hands.\n\nThe police offered 500 liras, and the Jewish Agency offered 1000, to anyone with information on the suspects.\n\n==Police proceedings==\n===Stavsky===\nAs Suspect Number 1:<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> He was arrested in the early morning of Monday, June 19 at his home in Tel Aviv. He denied all charges, claiming that he was in Jerusalem at the night of the murder.\n\nHe was suspected by Yitzchak Halutz, a clerk in the Immigration Department in Jerusalem. The week before, Stavsky had applied for an exit visa to return to Poland and recruit more people for the Revisionist party. His petition was denied. On the morning of June 16, he went to the immigration offices in Jerusalem, and spoke with Halutz to ask for his application fee back. The next day, June 17, Halutz saw the police blotter with the description of the two men. Number 1 reminded him of Stavsky, and he immediately contacted the police. He gave them Stavsky's photo which was attached to the exit visa petition. A warrant was put out for Stavsky's arrest.<ref>Teveth 1982, p. 180.</ref>\n\n===Rosenblatt===\nAs Suspect Number 2:<ref>Teveth 1982, p. 154.</ref> He was arrested 37 days after the murder, on July 23, at the Beitar camp in Kfar Saba. He denied all charges, claiming that he was at a party meeting in Kfar Saba the night of the murder.\n\nHe was suspected by Rivka Feigin, a member of the Rosenblatt's Beitar group. She told Mapai authorities that she had heard an editor at Hazit Ha'am say with certainty that Number 2 was Rosenblatt. The Mapai leadership went to the police.\n\n===Achimeir===\nAs aiding and abetting the murder suspects:<ref>Teveth 1982, p. 113.</ref> He was arrested during the week following the assassination. He was linked to the murder primarily because of his association with Brit Habiryonim. He was eventually acquitted because there was not enough evidence to take him with which to try him.\n\n==Political reaction==\n===Mapai===\nImmediately after the murder, Mapai created its own inquiry committee, to help the police in the official investigation. The three primary suspected groups were the Revisionists, the Communists and Arabs. However, many within Mapai \u2013 including Ben-Gurion \u2013 believed that members of the Revisionists had committed the crime.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, p. 138.</ref>\n\n===Revisionists===\nAt first, the Revisionists fully denied any involvement. When Stavsky was arrested, instead of defending him, they actually believed his guilt. They tried to distance Stavsky's relationship to them, claiming that he was a Communist at heart, and had committed the murder of his own accord. Their official position changed when Jabotinsky defended Stavsky in a party newspaper on July 22. He further denounced Mapai as creating a blood libel against the Revisionists. He said that the party was using the murder as a political stepping stool. Some Revisionists later said that Mapai committed the murder itself, in order to blame the opposition.<ref>Teveth 1982, p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Abdul Majud==\nIn January 1934, an Arab prisoner from Jaffa, who was being held in the Jerusalem jail for a revenge murder, confessed to the Arlosoroff murder. He claimed that he was Number 1 and that a man named Issa Ibn Darwish was Number 2. He explained that on the night of the murder, he and Issa had gone for a walk on the beach. He had no intention of killing anyone; he did not even know who Arlosoroff was. The third time they passed by the couple Abdul Majud approached Arlosoroff and asked him for the time. When Arlosoroff responded that it was too dark for him to tell, Abdul Majud replied that he had a flashlight, and turned it on. He saw that Arlosoroff was suddenly looking straight ahead; when he turned around, he saw Issa aiming a gun at Arlosoroff. Issa shot Arlosoroff and ran away. Abdul Majud was surprised, and not knowing what to do, ran after him. He asked Issa why he shot the man; he replied that he wanted to scare him so that he would leave and Issa would be able to assault his wife. At the last second, he grew afraid, and shot Arlosoroff.\n\nIssa denied all involvement.\n\nSoon after his confession, Sima came to another suspect line-up. She did not recognize either Abdul Majud or Issa.\n\nIn February 1934, Abdul Majud recanted his original confession, saying that he had met Stavsky and Rosenblatt in the Jaffa prison before he was transferred to Jerusalem. They had bribed him to take responsibility for the murder, saying that because he had confessed to the first murder, he could confess to another, and would receive the same punishment. With the help of a Hebrew-speaking Arab prisoner, they taught Abdul Majud exactly what happened and what he should tell the police.\n\nThis twist in the trial was inconsequential. Abdul Majud never testified in court. The prosecution used the story as another piece of evidence against Stavsky and Rosenblatt, especially in that Sima only recognized them. The defense dismissed it as a way for Abdul Majud to seek a personal revenge on Issa.<ref name=\"Assize1934\">{{cite book|author=Palestine; Court of Criminal Assize|title=The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents|year=1934|publisher=Hassolel Partnership (S. White & Co.)}} pp. 134\u2013158.</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nThe Arlosoroff murder trial began in May 1934, and ended a week before the first anniversary of his assassination.\n\n===Prosecution===\n\nMostly dependent on Sima's eyewitness testimony.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. V.</ref>\n\n===Evidence and faulty alibis===\n\n===Stavsky===\nPhoto Identification: the day that the police got Stavsky's photo from Halutz, the police brought it and a number of other photographs to Sima for identification. She identified Stavsky as Number 1.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nSuspect Line-up: Sima walked with a police officer down a line of suspects the day that Stavsky was arrested. She stopped when she reached Stavsky. She physically identified him as Number 1.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 181\u2013182.</ref>\n\nStavsky claimed that he was at the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem at 10&nbsp;pm, the time of the murder. This was not proven. Witnesses testified that he was in Jerusalem before and after, but no one said that he was there at the exact window of time. The reliability of the witnesses was under question. Two policemen who were in the restaurant between 7:30\u20138:30 testified that they did not see Stavsky. Also, Stavsky's landlords testified for the prosecution that he was home in Tel Aviv in the early evening.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XV-XIX.</ref>\n\nStavsky also said that he slept in a Jerusalem hotel that night. Just because Stavsky slept in Jerusalem that Friday night does not mean that he could not have been in Tel Aviv earlier. There was no testimony as to when he arrived at the Jerusalem hotel and went to bed.\n\nAlso, Stavsky had planned to leave the country the following week \u2013 this fit in with his need to escape after his crime.\n\n===Rosenblatt===\nSima didn't recognize Rosenblatt from a photograph, but she did recognize him in a line-up, a more reliable identification.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, p. 187.</ref>\n\nJacket Identification: Sima was given nine jackets to identify, one of which belonged to Rosenblatt. She picked out Rosenblatt's jacket as the one worn by Number 2, explaining that she recognized it from its zig-zag pattern and red color.\n\nRosenblatt originally said that he was at a party. He later recanted and said he was at a Beitar meeting in Kfar Saba. Witnesses who were at the meeting were called and their stories did not always match. Also, the minutes of the meeting were presented, but it just so happened that night that a temporary secretary was taking notes, in a different fashion than what was normally done. Their authenticity was called into question.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XXII-XXIII</ref>\n\nRosenblatt's girlfriend was in their tent when he came in that night. Only she would have known his exact whereabouts then, but she was not called to give testimony.\n\n===Defense===\nThe defense insisted there was no premeditated motive for the crime, political or otherwise. The political parties act within the social confines of the Palestinian Jewish community and their functions do not warrant a murder, it said.\n\nThe defense attorneys said Arlosoroff had been in Europe until June 14, and his return was unexpected. If his own wife did not know when he would be returning, his political opponents certainly did not. Even if they began to plot after he returned, they had no way of knowing that he would be on the beach on Friday night. Until Friday afternoon, the Arlosoroffs themselves had assumed that they wouldn't be in Tel Aviv for the weekend. There is no way that a pre-meditated murder could be planned out in five hours, taking into consideration that Stavsky was in Jerusalem and Rosenblatt was in Kfar Saba all day Friday.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nRather, the defense contended that the crime was actually an 'impromptu sexual attack' by two other men. The men did not cover their faces and the shooter did not shoot right away. The murder was not his goal. The goal was to sexually attack Sima. They walked by the couple a few times, trying to draw attention to themselves. At one point, Number 1 urinated into the sea \u2013 'display of exhibitionism'. In fact, Number 2's 'Oriental gesture' before he fired the gun was a sexual one.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Evidence and strong alibis===\n\n===Stavsky===\nPhoto Identification: the police procedure was irregular. It was done after a warrant was put out for Stavsky's arrest, but before he was apprehended. Stavsky's profile looked distinct from the rest of the nine, in both his physical appearance and his clothing, thereby drawing more attention to him.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', 43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuspect Line-up: it was done a day after Sima had identified Stavsky in the photo \u2013 his image was still in her memory. According to a police officer on duty, his arm was around her back \u2013 he could have unconsciously stopped her when they reached Stavsky. Also, as opposed to the rest of the men in the line-up, Stavsky was unshaven, hatless and hefty, thus making him stand out more.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nFour people testified that they saw Stavsky in the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem that night, and that he was still there by 8:45&nbsp;pm. This would not have given him enough time to get to Tel Aviv by the time of the murder. The Arlosoroffs only decided to go to the beach at 9:30 \u2013 there is no way that Stavsky could have known that in time to commit the crime.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\n===Rosenblatt===\nJacket Identification: The zig-zag pattern is a common design. Even more so, there is no way that Sima would have been able to see the color red at that time of night. Therefore, the color is inconsequential.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 93.</ref>\n\nIt is highly improbable that the minutes were counterfeited just for the defense of the accused. The point is that Rosenblatt was at the meeting for its entirety (until 10&nbsp;pm), as can be shown by both the witnesses and the fact that his words were recorded twice in the minutes. There would have been no way for him to get to Tel Aviv to commit the murder by then. Also, the minutes were taken by a temporary secretary because the permanent secretary was religious and didn't write from Friday night until Saturday night.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\n===Outcome===\nThe presiding judges declared the following majority ruling:<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>\n\n\"The Court, by majority, finds that at Tel Aviv, on the night of the June 16/17, 1933, with premeditated intent to kill, the accused Abraham Stavsky, did take part in the premeditated killing of Dr. Haim Arlosoroff by following him, waiting for him, stopping him and directing the light of an electric torch upon him and being close by during the commission of the offense.\" Stavsky was sentenced to punishment by death.\n\n\"As regards the accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, the Court does not find the other material evidence required by Section 5 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Ordinance, 1924, to corroborate his identification by Mrs. Arlosoroff. The accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, is therefore acquitted of the offense of which he stands charged.\"\n\nThe single dissenting judge ruled the following:\n\n\"That the crime was committed at such time and such a place when and where persons are known to and in fact do resort for immoral purposes...That the alibi of the accused is insufficiently established...The crime was not a political one but was most probably a common attack for sexual purposes...That none of the accused had any connection with the murder...I therefore find them not guilty of the charge and acquit them.\"\n\n==Stavsky's appeal and acquittal==\nStavsky was acquitted at the Court of Criminal Appeal because there not enough material evidence, as required by law.<ref name=\"Maoz 2000\"/> \"The Appeal Court even went so far as to state that had the case been heard in England itself, or in most of the territories of the British Empire, the conviction would rightly have been upheld.\"\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 1982, Israeli historian Shabtai Teveth re-introduced the event to the Israeli population with an investigative account of the murder and the trial proceedings. In response to the newly piqued public interest, the government, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], himself a member of the right-wing party, commissioned a state-administered investigative committee.<ref>See Nadav G. Molchadsky (2015), \u201cCase Closed \u2013 Affair Open: The Bekhor Commission and the Affair of the Arlosoroff Murder,\u201d in History in the Public Courtroom: Commissions of Inquiry and Struggles over the History and Memory of Israeli Traumas, (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles), pp. 165-254.</ref> \n\nAccording to the Commission's term of reference, \"(A)llegations and accusations have recently been published\u2014some of them for the first time\u2014to the effect that Avraham Stavsky and Zvi Rosenblatt, or one of them, were accomplices to the murder of Dr. Chaim Arlosoroff (The Murder of Arlosoroff by Shabtai Teveth, Schocken Books, 1982).\" The Bekhor Commission was required to \u201cinvestigate these allegations and accusations, and submit a report to the cabinet on its findings.\u201d\n\nThe Bekhor Commission\u2019s work continued for three years, at the end of which it was still unable to reach a positive conclusion about who murdered Arlosoroff. While the Commission definitively found that Stavsky and Rosenblatt did not commit the murder, the evidence and material brought before it were not sufficient to enable it to determine \u201cwho the murderers were,\u201d and \u201cwhether it was a political murder on behalf of any party, or not.\"<ref name=\"Maoz 2000\"/>\n\n==Importance==\nThe trial proceedings of the murder of Arlosoroff highlighted the external and internal dynamics between the ruling British Mandate, the dominant Mapai party, and the opposing Revisionist party. This event was an important climax point in the internal relations of the Jews in Palestine, and its resonance continued even after the State of Israel was established in 1948.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Law|Israel}}\n*[[List of unsolved deaths]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Coord missing|Israel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arlosoroff, Haim}}\n[[Category:Assassinations]]\n[[Category:Deaths by person]]\n[[Category:History of Tel Aviv]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders]]\n[[Category:1933 in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:June 1933 events]]\n[[Category:Murder in 1933]]\n[[Category:1933 murders in Asia]]\n[[Category:20th century in Tel Aviv]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2012}}\n[[Haim Arlosoroff]] was assassinated on the night of Friday, June 16, 1933, as the left-wing [[Zionist]] leader was walking with his wife on the beach in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Initially believed to be carried out by his right-wing political enemies, the subsequent court case ended in acquittal for the two accused of the crime. A third man was acquitted early on of advising the two to commit the act. The case has never been definitively solved.\n\n==Political background==\nAt the time of the murder, the two primary opposing [[Zionist]] political parties in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] were the mainstream [[Mapai]], the left-wing Socialist party, and the opposing [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]], the right-wing nationalist party. The rift between the two sects evolved with the end of World War I and the ensuing British colonization of Palestine. Globally represented by the [[World Zionist Organization]] and by the Jewish [[Yishuv]] within domestic Palestine, Mapai, led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], encouraged mass Jewish immigration and continuous settling of the land. Its leadership found it essential to cooperate with the ruling [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. Adhering to a code of practical Zionism, the official position of the Zionist leadership found it vital to develop the physical land in order to stake a claim over it. The Revisionists, led by [[Vladimir (Ze\u2019ev) Jabotinsky]], relied on the principles of political Zionism. They saw it imperative to gain total control over the country before devoting power toward its material improvement. It promoted procurement of independence from the English Mandate as the sole means for reestablishing a Jewish homeland.<ref name=\"Kaplan2005\">{{cite book|first=Eran|last=Kaplan|title=The Jewish radical right: Revisionist Zionism and its ideological legacy|url=https://archive.org/details/jewishradicalrig00kapl|url-access=registration|accessdate=June 26, 2011|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20380-1}} p. 139</ref>\n\nCharging Mapai leaders with prejudices against non-adherents, the dissonance between the two groups sounded louder and more pronounced.<ref>Kaplan 2005, p. 5.</ref> The rift reached a climax when Mapai showed interest in negotiations with the Nazi government over German Jews' expedited immigration to Palestine. These negotiations were spearheaded by Arlosoroff, and he was in Germany regarding this matter the week before his murder.

In 1924, he moved to Palestine; two years later, he was a Jewish Palestinian representative at the [[League of Nations]] conference. In 1930, he helped merge his own Hapoel Hatzair party with the [[Poale Zion]] party, thus forming a new Labor party called Mapai. At the time of his murder, he was the head of the political department of the [[Jewish Agency]] in Palestine.

The most important part was his meeting with [[Nazi]] officials in an effort to negotiate details of German Jews' property transfer to Palestine. While viewed by Mapai as a valuable measure to insure the assets of these Jews, this negotiation was hotly contested by the Revisionists, who believed that under no circumstances should deals be made with the Nazis.\n\nOn the morning of the day of his murder, June 16, Arlosoroff was in [[Jerusalem]] on business. He spent the morning at the offices of the Jewish Agency. Sima was meant to meet him there in the early afternoon, upon which they would return home to [[Tel Aviv]]. Sima was supposed to make plans as to their weekend activity; the couple wanted to get away from the city for a few days. When she arrived at the Agency, Arlosoroff told her that he would return home by himself later in the afternoon.\n\nWhen Arlosoroff came home at 5:15&nbsp;pm, the couple decided to stay in Tel Aviv for that night. At 8:30&nbsp;pm they ate dinner at the beachfront Kaete Dan hotel. At 9:30&nbsp;pm they finished dinner and went for a walk on the beach.\n\nThey walked North, towards the [[Yarkon River]]. According to Sima, at a certain point she felt that they were being followed by two men. Arlosoroff brushed off her worry, and they continued walking. When they got to the end of the shoreline, they turned back. They saw the two men whom Sima had been afraid of earlier, and let them pass by in front of them. Sima was closer to the sea; Arlosoroff was closer to the city.\n\nAt 10&nbsp;pm, the couple approached the two men. The bigger of the two suddenly shone a flashlight in Arlosoroff's face, and asked him for the time. Arlosoroff responded that they had no right to bother them; the man asked again. In the meantime, the smaller man made what was later described by Sima as an \"Oriental gesture\" and took out a gun. The larger man turned off his flashlight. The smaller man aimed the gun at Arlosoroff, and fired. He fell to the ground. The two men ran from the scene as Sima called for help.\n\nThree bystanders who heard her cries rushed Arlosoroff to the hospital. After drifting in and out of consciousness for three hours, he died at 12:45&nbsp;am on Saturday morning, June 17.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 7\u201311.</ref>\n\n==Police blotter==\nThe official suspect police blotter appeared in newspapers around the country on Saturday afternoon.

The three primary suspected groups were the Revisionists, the Communists and Arabs. However, many within Mapai \u2013 including Ben-Gurion \u2013 believed that members of the Revisionists had committed the crime.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, p. 138.</ref>\n\n===Revisionists===\nAt first, the Revisionists fully denied any involvement. When Stavsky was arrested, instead of defending him, they actually believed his guilt. They tried to distance Stavsky's relationship to them, claiming that he was a Communist at heart, and had committed the murder of his own accord. Their official position changed when Jabotinsky defended Stavsky in a party newspaper on July 22. He further denounced Mapai as creating a blood libel against the Revisionists. He said that the party was using the murder as a political stepping stool. Some Revisionists later said that Mapai committed the murder itself, in order to blame the opposition.<ref>Teveth 1982, p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Abdul Majud==\nIn January 1934, an Arab prisoner from Jaffa, who was being held in the Jerusalem jail for a revenge murder, confessed to the Arlosoroff murder. He claimed that he was Number 1 and that a man named Issa Ibn Darwish was Number 2. He explained that on the night of the murder, he and Issa had gone for a walk on the beach. He had no intention of killing anyone; he did not even know who Arlosoroff was. The third time they passed by the couple Abdul Majud approached Arlosoroff and asked him for the time. When Arlosoroff responded that it was too dark for him to tell, Abdul Majud replied that he had a flashlight, and turned it on. He saw that Arlosoroff was suddenly looking straight ahead; when he turned around, he saw Issa aiming a gun at Arlosoroff. Issa shot Arlosoroff and ran away. Abdul Majud was surprised, and not knowing what to do, ran after him. He asked Issa why he shot the man; he replied that he wanted to scare him so that he would leave and Issa would be able to assault his wife. At the last second, he grew afraid, and shot Arlosoroff.\n\nIssa denied all involvement.\n\nSoon after his confession, Sima came to another suspect line-up. She did not recognize either Abdul Majud or Issa.\n\nIn February 1934, Abdul Majud recanted his original confession, saying that he had met Stavsky and Rosenblatt in the Jaffa prison before he was transferred to Jerusalem. They had bribed him to take responsibility for the murder, saying that because he had confessed to the first murder, he could confess to another, and would receive the same punishment. With the help of a Hebrew-speaking Arab prisoner, they taught Abdul Majud exactly what happened and what he should tell the police.\n\nThis twist in the trial was inconsequential. Abdul Majud never testified in court. The prosecution used the story as another piece of evidence against Stavsky and Rosenblatt, especially in that Sima only recognized them. The defense dismissed it as a way for Abdul Majud to seek a personal revenge on Issa.<ref name=\"Assize1934\">{{cite book|author=Palestine; Court of Criminal Assize|title=The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents|year=1934|publisher=Hassolel Partnership (S. White & Co.)}} pp. 134\u2013158.</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nThe Arlosoroff murder trial began in May 1934, and ended a week before the first anniversary of his assassination.\n\n===Prosecution===\n\nMostly dependent on Sima's eyewitness testimony.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. V.</ref>\n\n===Evidence and faulty alibis===\n\n===Stavsky===\nPhoto Identification: the day that the police got Stavsky's photo from Halutz, the police brought it and a number of other photographs to Sima for identification. She identified Stavsky as Number 1.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nSuspect Line-up: Sima walked with a police officer down a line of suspects the day that Stavsky was arrested. She stopped when she reached Stavsky. She physically identified him as Number 1.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 181\u2013182.</ref>\n\nStavsky claimed that he was at the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem at 10&nbsp;pm, the time of the murder. This was not proven. Witnesses testified that he was in Jerusalem before and after, but no one said that he was there at the exact window of time. The reliability of the witnesses was under question. Two policemen who were in the restaurant between 7:30\u20138:30 testified that they did not see Stavsky. Also, Stavsky's landlords testified for the prosecution that he was home in Tel Aviv in the early evening.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XV-XIX.</ref>\n\nStavsky also said that he slept in a Jerusalem hotel that night. Just because Stavsky slept in Jerusalem that Friday night does not mean that he could not have been in Tel Aviv earlier. There was no testimony as to when he arrived at the Jerusalem hotel and went to bed.\n\nAlso, Stavsky had planned to leave the country the following week \u2013 this fit in with his need to escape after his crime.\n\n===Rosenblatt===\nSima didn't recognize Rosenblatt from a photograph, but she did recognize him in a line-up, a more reliable identification.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, p. 187.</ref>\n\nJacket Identification: Sima was given nine jackets to identify, one of which belonged to Rosenblatt. She picked out Rosenblatt's jacket as the one worn by Number 2, explaining that she recognized it from its zig-zag pattern and red color.\n\nRosenblatt originally said that he was at a party. He later recanted and said he was at a Beitar meeting in Kfar Saba. Witnesses who were at the meeting were called and their stories did not always match. Also, the minutes of the meeting were presented, but it just so happened that night that a temporary secretary was taking notes, in a different fashion than what was normally done. Their authenticity was called into question.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XXII-XXIII</ref>\n\nRosenblatt's girlfriend was in their tent when he came in that night. Only she would have known his exact whereabouts then, but she was not called to give testimony.\n\n===Defense===\nThe defense insisted there was no premeditated motive for the crime, political or otherwise. The political parties act within the social confines of the Palestinian Jewish community and their functions do not warrant a murder, it said.\n\nThe defense attorneys said Arlosoroff had been in Europe until June 14, and his return was unexpected. If his own wife did not know when he would be returning, his political opponents certainly did not. Even if they began to plot after he returned, they had no way of knowing that he would be on the beach on Friday night. Until Friday afternoon, the Arlosoroffs themselves had assumed that they wouldn't be in Tel Aviv for the weekend. There is no way that a pre-meditated murder could be planned out in five hours, taking into consideration that Stavsky was in Jerusalem and Rosenblatt was in Kfar Saba all day Friday.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nRather, the defense contended that the crime was actually an 'impromptu sexual attack' by two other men. The men did not cover their faces and the shooter did not shoot right away. The murder was not his goal. The goal was to sexually attack Sima. They walked by the couple a few times, trying to draw attention to themselves. At one point, Number 1 urinated into the sea \u2013 'display of exhibitionism'. In fact, Number 2's 'Oriental gesture' before he fired the gun was a sexual one.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Evidence and strong alibis===\n\n===Stavsky===\nPhoto Identification: the police procedure was irregular. It was done after a warrant was put out for Stavsky's arrest, but before he was apprehended. Stavsky's profile looked distinct from the rest of the nine, in both his physical appearance and his clothing, thereby drawing more attention to him.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', 43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuspect Line-up: it was done a day after Sima had identified Stavsky in the photo \u2013 his image was still in her memory. According to a police officer on duty, his arm was around her back \u2013 he could have unconsciously stopped her when they reached Stavsky. Also, as opposed to the rest of the men in the line-up, Stavsky was unshaven, hatless and hefty, thus making him stand out more.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nFour people testified that they saw Stavsky in the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem that night, and that he was still there by 8:45&nbsp;pm. This would not have given him enough time to get to Tel Aviv by the time of the murder. The Arlosoroffs only decided to go to the beach at 9:30 \u2013 there is no way that Stavsky could have known that in time to commit the crime.<ref>Bechor, Berkowitz & Keneth 1985, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\n===Rosenblatt===\nJacket Identification: The zig-zag pattern is a common design. Even more so, there is no way that Sima would have been able to see the color red at that time of night. Therefore, the color is inconsequential.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 93.</ref>\n\nIt is highly improbable that the minutes were counterfeited just for the defense of the accused. The point is that Rosenblatt was at the meeting for its entirety (until 10&nbsp;pm), as can be shown by both the witnesses and the fact that his words were recorded twice in the minutes. There would have been no way for him to get to Tel Aviv to commit the murder by then. Also, the minutes were taken by a temporary secretary because the permanent secretary was religious and didn't write from Friday night until Saturday night.<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\n===Outcome===\nThe presiding judges declared the following majority ruling:<ref>''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>\n\n\"The Court, by majority, finds that at Tel Aviv, on the night of the June 16/17, 1933, with premeditated intent to kill, the accused Abraham Stavsky, did take part in the premeditated killing of Dr. Haim Arlosoroff by following him, waiting for him, stopping him and directing the light of an electric torch upon him and being close by during the commission of the offense.\" Stavsky was sentenced to punishment by death.\n\n\"As regards the accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, the Court does not find the other material evidence required by Section 5 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Ordinance, 1924, to corroborate his identification by Mrs. Arlosoroff. The accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, is therefore acquitted of the offense of which he stands charged.\"\n\nThe single dissenting judge ruled the following:\n\n\"That the crime was committed at such time and such a place when and where persons are known to and in fact do resort for immoral purposes...That the alibi of the accused is insufficiently established...The crime was not a political one but was most probably a common attack for sexual purposes...That none of the accused had any connection with the murder...I therefore find them not guilty of the charge and acquit them.\"\n\n==Stavsky's appeal and acquittal==\nStavsky was acquitted at the Court of Criminal Appeal because there not enough material evidence, as required by law.<ref name=\"Maoz 2000\"/> \"The Appeal Court even went so far as to state that had the case been heard in England itself, or in most of the territories of the British Empire, the conviction would rightly have been upheld.\"\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe perpetrators were never convicted.\n\nIn 1982, Israeli historian Shabtai Teveth re-introduced the event to the Israeli population with an investigative account of the murder and the trial proceedings. In response to the newly piqued public interest, the government, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], himself a member of the right-wing party, commissioned a state-administered investigative committee.<ref>See Nadav G. Molchadsky (2015), \u201cCase Closed \u2013 Affair Open: The Bekhor Commission and the Affair of the Arlosoroff Murder,\u201d in History in the Public Courtroom: Commissions of Inquiry and Struggles over the History and Memory of Israeli Traumas, (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles), pp. 165-254.</ref> \n\nAccording to the Commission's term of reference, \"(A)llegations and accusations have recently been published\u2014some of them for the first time\u2014to the effect that Avraham Stavsky and Zvi Rosenblatt, or one of them, were accomplices to the murder of Dr. Chaim Arlosoroff (The Murder of Arlosoroff by Shabtai Teveth, Schocken Books, 1982).\" The Bekhor Commission was required to \u201cinvestigate these allegations and accusations, and submit a report to the cabinet on its findings.\u201d\n\nThe Bekhor Commission\u2019s work continued for three years, at the end of which it was still unable to reach a positive conclusion about who murdered Arlosoroff. While the Commission definitively found that Stavsky and Rosenblatt did not commit the murder, the evidence and material brought before it were not sufficient to enable it to determine \u201cwho the murderers were,\u201d and \u201cwhether it was a political murder on behalf of any party, or not.\"<ref name=\"Maoz 2000\"/>\n\n==Importance==\nThe trial proceedings of the murder of Arlosoroff highlighted the external and internal dynamics between the ruling British Mandate, the dominant Mapai party, and the opposing Revisionist party. This event was an important climax point in the internal relations of the Jews in Palestine, and its resonance continued even after the State of Israel was established in 1948.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Law|Israel}}\n*[[List of unsolved deaths]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Coord missing|Israel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arlosoroff, Haim}}\n[[Category:Assassinations]]\n[[Category:Deaths by person]]\n[[Category:History of Tel Aviv]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders]]\n[[Category:1933 in Mandatory Palestine]]\n[[Category:June 1933 events]]\n[[Category:Murder in 1933]]\n[[Category:1933 murders in Asia]]\n[[Category:20th century in Tel Aviv]]\n", "name_user": "FidlerontheRoof", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAftermath", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Haim_Arlosoroff"}

He rose to prominence for his portrayal of [[Ron Weasley]], one of the three main characters in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. Grint was cast as Ron at the age of 11, having previously acted only in school plays and at his local theatre group. From 2001 to 2011, he starred in all eight ''Harry Potter'' films.\n\nBeginning in 2002, Grint began to work outside of the ''Harry Potter'' franchise, playing a co-leading role in ''[[Thunderpants]]''.

The population was 1,009 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S.Decennial Census]].\n\n==History==\nCape Charles, located close to the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], on [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern Shore]], was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, [[William Lawrence Scott]] became president of the [[New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad|New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company]] (NYP&N), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Littleton Waller Tazewell]]. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&N, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the \"Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles\"). Some of this land, named [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]] for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk.\n\nThe original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today.<ref name=northampton>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.northampton.va.us/departments/comp_plan/Appendix%2002%20CapeCharlesCompPlan.pdf|title=Cape Charles, Virginia Comprehensive Plan|year=2002|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistorian William G. Thomas writes, \"At a cost of nearly $300,000, the [[New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad]] (N.Y.P. & N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King's and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation \"City\" for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible....In 1890,  the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.\"\n[[File:IndustryCapeCharles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Industrial landscape in Cape Charles]]\n\nCape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the [[Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry]], providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across [[Hampton Roads]] harbor to [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] - [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] on the northern [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former [[Eastern Shore Railroad]] which later became [[Bay Coast Railroad]] across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby.\n\nThe town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old [[Eastern Shore Baseball League]].\n\nThe [[Cape Charles Historic District]] and [[Stratton Manor]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 1040\n|1910= 1948\n|1920= 2517\n|1930= 2527\n|1940= 2299\n|1950= 2427\n|1960= 2041\n|1970= 1689\n|1980= 1512\n|1990= 1398\n|2000= 1134\n|2010= 1009\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1003\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\"/> of 2000, there were 1,134 people, 536 households, and 278 families residing in the town. The population density was 309.4 people per square mile (119.3/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 740 housing units at an average density of 201.9 per square mile (77.9/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the town was 53.79% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 42.86% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.09% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.44% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.59% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.23% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 2.82% of the population.\n\nThere were 536 households out of which 21.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 30.4% were married couples living together, 19.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.1% were non-families. 43.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 26.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.91.\n\nIn the town, the age distribution of the population shows 22.1% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 22.0% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 23.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 76.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.9 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $22,237, and the median income for a family was $29,167. Males had a median income of $25,536 versus $23,984 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $13,789. About 21.5% of families and 28.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 43.4% of those under age 18 and 23.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Geography==\nCape Charles is located at {{coord|37.267522|-76.014125|type:city_region:US-VA|format=dms|display=inline}} (37.267522, &minus;76.014125).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 1, 2018|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nCape Charles lies on a peninsula and is surrounded by water on three sides. The town is situated directly on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], bordered by King's Creek to the north and Old Plantation Creek to the south. The land in town is low lying and relatively flat, with the highest point of elevation at 15 feet, and a slope of less than 1%. Most of the developed land in town is between 5 and 10 feet in elevation.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 4.4&nbsp;square miles (11.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 3.7&nbsp;square miles (9.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land and 0.7&nbsp;square miles (1.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (16.06%) is water.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]] formed about 35 million years ago during the late Eocene when a comet fragment or asteroid struck the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf in the area now occupied by the southern part of Chesapeake Bay and adjacent landmasses in the Virginia Coastal Plain. The resulting structure is an approximately circular, 53-mile-diameter crater centered near the town of Cape Charles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1094/ofr2007-1094.pdf|author=Gregory S.

The beach extends one-half mile along Bay Avenue with a paved walkway bordering the length of the beachfront. Residents and visitors of the town use the beach for swimming, sunbathing and similar recreational pursuits. Public access onto the beachfront is provided by two wooden walkovers located near the end of Tazewell and Randolph Avenues, as well as the town's Fun Pier which also has a wooden walkover. The beach is stabilized with buried groins and a bulkhead. In 1987 the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor and channel and deposited the sand along the beach area, which greatly expanded the width of the beach and improved the quality of sand along the beachfront. Beach erosion is an ongoing problem and will require sand replenishment on a periodic basis in order to maintain a sandy beachfront.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nAdjacent to the public beach is a municipal pier which extends across the stone jetty at the entrance of the harbor. The wooden pier, which is known as the Fun Pier, has a railed siding and several built-in benches, and is frequently utilized by Town residents and visitors for sightseeing. Cape Charles is also home to one of six public boat ramp sites in [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]], and one of only three sites on the County's Bayside.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nThe nearby 29-acre Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve, owned by [[Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation]], has a long boardwalk that traverses several natural communities, including a Maritime Loblolly Pine Forest, and ends at a low bluff overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. The preserve provides habitat for the federally threatened northeastern beach tiger beetle and is part of the Lower Delmarva Important Bird Area. During fall bird migration, the forest abounds with migratory songbirds and raptors resting and feeding before continuing their journey across the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/vbwt/sites/cape-charles-and-cape-charles-natural-area-preserve/|title=CES05: Town of Cape Charles & Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve|publisher=Department of Game and Inland Fisheries|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe Cape Charles Harbor serves local industry and commerce operations as well as tourists and recreational users. The harbor was originally developed to load and unload railroad cars on barges. The harbor includes extensive bulkheading, as well as commercial docking facilities for industrial uses. The Industrial land use in the Town is concentrated at the Cape Charles Harbor area, and includes the [[Eastern Shore Railroad]], Bayshore Concrete, the commercial dock and the Sustainable Technology Park.<ref name=northampton/>\n\n==Climate==\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Cape Charles features a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot, humid summers and chilly, but not very cold winters. Temperatures routinely exceed 90&nbsp;\u00b0F in the summer and typically dips below the freezing point during the winter, though it is somewhat rare for temperatures to dip far below freezing. Cape Charles on average receives roughly 45 inches of precipitation annually.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cape Charles, Virginia\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 75\n|Feb record high F =

Virginia]], United States. The population was 1,009 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S.Decennial Census]].\n\n==History==\nCape Charles, located close to the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], on [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Virginia's Eastern Shore]], was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, [[William Lawrence Scott]] became president of the [[New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad|New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company]] (NYP&N), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Littleton Waller Tazewell]]. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&N, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the \"Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles\"). Some of this land, named [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]] for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk.\n\nThe original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today.<ref name=northampton>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.northampton.va.us/departments/comp_plan/Appendix%2002%20CapeCharlesCompPlan.pdf|title=Cape Charles, Virginia Comprehensive Plan|year=2002|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistorian William G. Thomas writes, \"At a cost of nearly $300,000, the [[New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad]] (N.Y.P. & N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King's and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation \"City\" for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible....In 1890,  the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.\"\n[[File:IndustryCapeCharles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Industrial landscape in Cape Charles]]\n\nCape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the [[Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry]], providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across [[Hampton Roads]] harbor to [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] - [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] on the northern [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former [[Eastern Shore Railroad]] which later became [[Bay Coast Railroad]] across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby.\n\nThe town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old [[Eastern Shore Baseball League]].\n\nThe [[Cape Charles Historic District]] and [[Stratton Manor]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 1040\n|1910= 1948\n|1920= 2517\n|1930= 2527\n|1940= 2299\n|1950= 2427\n|1960= 2041\n|1970= 1689\n|1980= 1512\n|1990= 1398\n|2000= 1134\n|2010= 1009\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1003\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\"/> of 2000, there were 1,134 people, 536 households, and 278 families residing in the town. The population density was 309.4 people per square mile (119.3/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 740 housing units at an average density of 201.9 per square mile (77.9/km<sup>2</sup>).

The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 76.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.9 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $22,237, and the median income for a family was $29,167. Males had a median income of $25,536 versus $23,984 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $13,789. About 21.5% of families and 28.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 43.4% of those under age 18 and 23.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Geography==\nCape Charles is located at {{coord|37.267522|-76.014125|type:city_region:US-VA|format=dms|display=inline}} (37.267522, &minus;76.014125).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 1, 2018|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nCape Charles lies on a peninsula and is surrounded by water on three sides. The town is situated directly on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], bordered by King's Creek to the north and Old Plantation Creek to the south. The land in town is low lying and relatively flat, with the highest point of elevation at 15 feet, and a slope of less than 1%. Most of the developed land in town is between 5 and 10 feet in elevation.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 4.4&nbsp;square miles (11.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 3.7&nbsp;square miles (9.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land and 0.7&nbsp;square miles (1.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (16.06%) is water.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]] formed about 35 million years ago during the late Eocene when a comet fragment or asteroid struck the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf in the area now occupied by the southern part of Chesapeake Bay and adjacent landmasses in the Virginia Coastal Plain. The resulting structure is an approximately circular, 53-mile-diameter crater centered near the town of Cape Charles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1094/ofr2007-1094.pdf|author=Gregory S.

The beach extends one-half mile along Bay Avenue with a paved walkway bordering the length of the beachfront. Residents and visitors of the town use the beach for swimming, sunbathing and similar recreational pursuits. Public access onto the beachfront is provided by two wooden walkovers located near the end of Tazewell and Randolph Avenues, as well as the town's Fun Pier which also has a wooden walkover. The beach is stabilized with buried groins and a bulkhead. In 1987 the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor and channel and deposited the sand along the beach area, which greatly expanded the width of the beach and improved the quality of sand along the beachfront. Beach erosion is an ongoing problem and will require sand replenishment on a periodic basis in order to maintain a sandy beachfront.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nAdjacent to the public beach is a municipal pier which extends across the stone jetty at the entrance of the harbor. The wooden pier, which is known as the Fun Pier, has a railed siding and several built-in benches, and is frequently utilized by Town residents and visitors for sightseeing. Cape Charles is also home to one of six public boat ramp sites in [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]], and one of only three sites on the County's Bayside.<ref name=northampton/>\n\nThe nearby 29-acre Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve, owned by [[Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation]], has a long boardwalk that traverses several natural communities, including a Maritime Loblolly Pine Forest, and ends at a low bluff overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. The preserve provides habitat for the federally threatened northeastern beach tiger beetle and is part of the Lower Delmarva Important Bird Area. During fall bird migration, the forest abounds with migratory songbirds and raptors resting and feeding before continuing their journey across the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/vbwt/sites/cape-charles-and-cape-charles-natural-area-preserve/|title=CES05: Town of Cape Charles & Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve|publisher=Department of Game and Inland Fisheries|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe Cape Charles Harbor serves local industry and commerce operations as well as tourists and recreational users. The harbor was originally developed to load and unload railroad cars on barges. The harbor includes extensive bulkheading, as well as commercial docking facilities for industrial uses. The Industrial land use in the Town is concentrated at the Cape Charles Harbor area, and includes the [[Eastern Shore Railroad]], Bayshore Concrete, the commercial dock and the Sustainable Technology Park.<ref name=northampton/>\n\n==Climate==\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Cape Charles features a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot, humid summers and chilly, but not very cold winters. Temperatures routinely exceed 90&nbsp;\u00b0F in the summer and typically dips below the freezing point during the winter, though it is somewhat rare for temperatures to dip far below freezing. Cape Charles on average receives roughly 45 inches of precipitation annually.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cape Charles, Virginia\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 75\n|Feb record high F = 78\n|Mar record high F = 85\n|Apr record high F = 93\n|May record high F = 95\n|Jun record high F = 98\n|Jul record high F = 99\n|Aug record high F = 98\n|Sep record high F = 98\n|Oct record high F = 91\n|Nov record high F = 82\n|Dec record high F = 77\n|year record high F= 99\n|Jan high F = 47\n|Feb high F = 50\n|Mar high F = 57\n|Apr high F = 67\n|May high F = 75\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 88\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 80\n|Oct high F = 70\n|Nov high F = 61\n|Dec high F = 51\n|year high F=\n|Jan low F = 31\n|Feb low F = 32\n|Mar low F = 38\n|Apr low F = 47\n|May low F = 56\n|Jun low F = 65\n|Jul low F = 70\n|Aug low F = 68\n|Sep low F = 62\n|Oct low F = 51\n|Nov low F = 43\n|Dec low F = 34\n|year low F=\n|Jan record low F = \u22125\n|Feb record low F = \u22121\n|Mar record low F = 9\n|Apr record low F = 24\n|May record low F = 31\n|Jun record low F = 36\n|Jul record low F = 47\n|Aug record low F = 44\n|Sep record low F = 39\n|Oct record low F = 24\n|Nov record low F = 16\n|Dec record low F = \u22121\n|year record low F= \u22125\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.47\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.12\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.13\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.27\n|May precipitation inch = 3.32\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.94\n|Jul precipitation inch = 5.04\n|Aug precipitation inch = 4.29\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.96\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.59\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.11\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.85\n|year precipitation inch= 45.09\n|source = The Weather Channel <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USVA0119|title=Climate Statistics for Cape Charles, Virginia|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Johnny Sample]], football defensive back, winner of three NFL championships, was from Cape Charles.\n*[[Melvin Williams Jr.]], first African-American to receive the ranking as Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Coast Guard, was from Cape Charles.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cape Charles, Virginia}}\n*[http://www.capecharlesbythebay.com Cape Charles by the Bay tourism & visitor information]\n*[http://capecharleswave.com Cape Charles Wave (online newspaper)]\n*[http://www.baydreaming.com/destinations/cape-charles-virginia/ Cape Charles, Virginia Guide]\n*[http://www.capecharlessunsets.com Cape Charles & Chesapeake Bay Live Webcam]\n*Will Thomas, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110110142818/http://southernspaces.org/2007/countryside-transformed-eastern-shore-virginia-pennsylvania-railroad-and-creation-modern-landsc The Countryside Transformed: The Eastern Shore of Virginia, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Creation of a Modern Landscape], ''Southern Spaces'', 31 July 2007.\n*[http://www.capecharles.org Cape Charles Municipal Website]\n*[http://www.northamptoncountychamber.com Northampton County Chamber of Commerce Website]\n*A finding aid to [http://findingaids.hagley.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/1972_250_2.xml Historic photographs from Cape Charles, Virginia] at [[Hagley Museum and Library]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]\n\n{{Virginia towns}}\n{{Northampton County, Virginia}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Northampton County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Towns in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Headlands of Virginia]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Chesapeake Bay]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Northampton County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1884]]\n[[Category:1884 establishments in Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Steve Elton", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added to notable people section)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Charles,_Virginia"}
