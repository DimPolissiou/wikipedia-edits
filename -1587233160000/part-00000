Years earlier Berton had been part of an exploratory team at Solaris but was recalled when he described seeing a four-meter-tall child on the surface of the water.

He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian, has killed himself. The two surviving crewmen\u2014Snaut and Sartorius\u2014are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He also finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the station.\n\nAfter a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari, his late wife, in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the \"visitors\" began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments using [[X-rays]] in a desperate attempt to understand the planet's nature.\n\nThat evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of \"neutrino systems\" but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as \"the annihilator\". Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]] patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions.\n\nIn time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence.  She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking [[liquid oxygen]], only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes.  On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel.\n\nKelvin becomes ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone; Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she describes how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors had stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet surface.  Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to remain with Solaris.\n\nKelvin meets with his father at their [[dacha]]. It is later revealed to be on an island in the Solaris ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Donatas Banionis]] as Kris Kelvin\n**[[Vladimir Zamansky]] as Kelvin's voice\n**Raimundas Banionis as young Kelvin\n* [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] as Hari\n* [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]] as Dr. Snaut\n**Vladimir Tatosov as Snaut's voice\n* [[Vladislav Dvorzhetsky]] as Henri Berton\n* [[Nikolai Grinko]] as Kelvin's Father\n* [[Olga Barnet]] as Kelvin's Mother\n* [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] as Dr. Sartorius\n* [[Sos Sargsyan]] as Dr. Gibarian\n*[[Aleksandr Misharin (screenwriter)|Aleksandr Misharin]] as Commissioner Shanahan\n*Bagrat Oganesyan as Professor Tarkhe\n*Tamara Ogorodnikova as Anna, Kelvin's Aunt\n*Tatyana Malykh as Kelvin's Niece\n*Vitalik Kerdimun as Berton's Son\n*[[Yulian Semyonov]] as Conference Chairman\n*Olga Kizilova as Dr. Gibarian's guest\n*Georgiy Teykh as Professor Messenger\n}}\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nIn 1968 the director Andrei Tarkovsky had several motives for cinematically adapting [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' (1961). First, he admired Lem's work. Second, he needed work and money, because his previous film, ''[[Andrei Rublev (movie)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966), had gone unreleased, and his screenplay ''A White, White Day'' had been rejected (in 1975 it was realised as ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]''). A film of a novel by Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], was a logical commercial and artistic choice.<ref name=wpowell>{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | author2=edited by William Powell | title = Collected Screenplays | publisher = Faber & Faber | year = 1999 | location = London}}</ref> Another inspiration was Tarkovsky's desire to bring emotional depth to the [[science-fiction]] genre, which he regarded as shallow due to its attention to technological invention; in a 1970 interview, he singled out [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as \"phoney on many points\" and \"a lifeless schema with only pretensions to truth\".<ref name=\"oc\">{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Colin |title=Andrei Tarkovsky Calls Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' a 'Phony' Film 'With Only Pretensions to Truth' |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/07/andrei-tarkovsky-calls-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-a-phony-film-with-only-pretensions-to-truth.html |website=[[Open Culture]] |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the adaptation. With [[Fridrikh Gorenshtein]], Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the summer of 1969; two-thirds of it occurred on Earth. The [[Mosfilm]] committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script, which has less action on Earth and deletes Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, from the story.<ref name=wpowell/> In the novel Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient [[extra-terrestrial life]] may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the movie, Tarkovsky concentrates on Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of [[outer space]] exploration on the [[human condition]]. Dr. Gibarian's monologue (from the novel's sixth chapter) is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says: \"We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors\". Unlike the novel, which begins with Kelvin's [[Interstellar travel|spaceflight]] and takes place entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives \u2013 a vibrant Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting Solaris \u2013 demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact on the human psyche.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lem | first = Stanis\u0142aw | title = Solaris | publisher = Harvest Books | date = November 2002 | isbn = 978-0-15-602760-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/solaris00lems_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left|A detail of ''The Hunters in the Snow'' (1565) by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], a thematic reference]]\n\nThe set design of ''Solaris'' features paintings by the [[Old Masters]].

Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]]. It was she who had introduced the novel ''Solaris'' to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970, but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director [[Larisa Shepitko]], who cast her in ''You and I''. Half a year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Bondarchuk as Hari after all.<ref>{{cite video | people = Bondarchuk, Natalya | title = Natalya Bondarchuk Interview | medium = DVD | publisher = Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor [[Donatas Banionis]] as Kelvin, the Estonian actor [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]] as Snaut, the Russian actor [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as Sartorius, the Ukrainian actor [[Nikolai Grinko]] as Kelvin's father, and [[Olga Barnet]] as Kelvin's mother. The director had already worked with Solonitsyn, who had played Andrei Rublev, and with Grinko, who appeared in ''Andrei Rublev'' and ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962).

He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian, has killed himself. The two surviving crewmen\u2014Snaut and Sartorius\u2014are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He also finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the station.\n\nAfter a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari, his late wife, in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the \"visitors\" began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments using [[X-rays]] in a desperate attempt to understand the planet's nature.\n\nThat evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of \"neutrino systems\" but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as \"the annihilator\". Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]] patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions.\n\nIn time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence.  She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking [[liquid oxygen]], only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes.  On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel.\n\nKelvin becomes ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone; Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she describes how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors had stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet surface.  Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to remain with Solaris.\n\nKelvin meets with his father at their [[dacha]].

First, he admired Lem's work. Second, he needed work and money, because his previous film, ''[[Andrei Rublev (movie)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966), had gone unreleased, and his screenplay ''A White, White Day'' had been rejected (in 1975 it was realised as ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]''). A film of a novel by Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], was a logical commercial and artistic choice.<ref name=wpowell>{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | author2=edited by William Powell | title = Collected Screenplays | publisher = Faber & Faber | year = 1999 | location = London}}</ref> Another inspiration was Tarkovsky's desire to bring emotional depth to the [[science-fiction]] genre, which he regarded as shallow due to its attention to technological invention; in a 1970 interview, he singled out [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as \"phoney on many points\" and \"a lifeless schema with only pretensions to truth\".<ref name=\"oc\">{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Colin |title=Andrei Tarkovsky Calls Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' a 'Phony' Film 'With Only Pretensions to Truth' |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/07/andrei-tarkovsky-calls-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-a-phony-film-with-only-pretensions-to-truth.html |website=[[Open Culture]] |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the adaptation. With [[Fridrikh Gorenshtein]], Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the summer of 1969; two-thirds of it occurred on Earth. The [[Mosfilm]] committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script, which has less action on Earth and deletes Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, from the story.<ref name=wpowell/> In the novel Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient [[extra-terrestrial life]] may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the movie, Tarkovsky concentrates on Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of [[outer space]] exploration on the [[human condition]]. Dr. Gibarian's monologue (from the novel's sixth chapter) is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says: \"We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors\". Unlike the novel, which begins with Kelvin's [[Interstellar travel|spaceflight]] and takes place entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives \u2013 a vibrant Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting Solaris \u2013 demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact on the human psyche.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lem | first = Stanis\u0142aw | title = Solaris | publisher = Harvest Books | date = November 2002 | isbn = 978-0-15-602760-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/solaris00lems_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left|A detail of ''The Hunters in the Snow'' (1565) by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], a thematic reference]]\n\nThe set design of ''Solaris'' features paintings by the [[Old Masters]].

Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson agreed to be paid in [[Soviet ruble|rubles]]. Nevertheless, [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]]. It was she who had introduced the novel ''Solaris'' to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970, but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director [[Larisa Shepitko]], who cast her in ''You and I''. Half a year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Bondarchuk as Hari after all.<ref>{{cite video | people = Bondarchuk, Natalya | title = Natalya Bondarchuk Interview | medium = DVD | publisher = Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor [[Donatas Banionis]] as Kelvin, the Estonian actor [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]] as Snaut, the Russian actor [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as Sartorius, the Ukrainian actor [[Nikolai Grinko]] as Kelvin's father, and [[Olga Barnet]] as Kelvin's mother. The director had already worked with Solonitsyn, who had played Andrei Rublev, and with Grinko, who appeared in ''Andrei Rublev'' and ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962).

The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were photographed in September and October 1971 at [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]] and Iikura in Tokyo. The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World [[Expo '70]], but the trip was delayed.

While in elementary school, she learned how to play the guitar and in 1972, her mother had her take private singing lessons. In the 1960s, while still in high school, she began to sing under the name \"Sockey\", which was short for her middle name Socorro.<ref name=\"MPR\">[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/lunna Music of Puerto Rico]</ref><ref name=\"L\">[http://www.prpop.org/biografias/l_bios/lunna.shtml Lunna]</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Lunna auditioned and was accepted in a group called Allegro, a locally popular group which included singer [[Tito Lara]]. Besides singing for Allegro, she also landed jobs singing radio and television commercials. Lunna eventually left the group to start singing solo. Her agent recommended that she change her artistic name, resulting in the \"Lunna\" name.<ref name=\"MPR\"/><ref name=\"L\"/>\n\nShe met and became romantically involved with [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[rock and roll]] teen idol, [[Charlie Robles]]. This romance was highly publicized in Puerto Rico and soon they were married. Sockey and Charlie had a daughter from this marriage; however, things didn't go well in the marriage and the couple ended up in divorce.<ref name=\"MPR\"/><ref name=\"L\"/>\n\n==Singing career==\nIn 1982, Lunna traveled to [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to represent Puerto Rico at the [[OTI Festival]], with the song \"''Sin tu m\u00fasica''\" (Witchout your music). Her fame soared in Puerto Rico, but her career was interrupted because of personal reasons. After four years of absence from the world of music, [[Glenn Monroig]], a fellow singer, convinced her to return. Together they recorded the album ''A Todo Dar'' (Everything Gives), the first [[Digital data|digital]]ly produced album in Puerto Rico. The album was renamed ''Motivos'' (Motives) and was produced by [[\u00c1ngel \"Cuco\" Pe\u00f1a]], it became a big \"hit\" in Puerto Rico. Among the songs included in the album was the song \"''Yo Perd\u00ed''\" (I Lost).  \"''Yo Perd\u00ed''\" made Puerto Rican musical history, when it became the \"first\" Puerto Rican song to be converted into a musical video, filmed in 35&nbsp;mm. In 1983, Lunna married \u00c1ngel \"Cuco\" Pe\u00f1a, with whom she had three children, Gabriel, Juan and \u00c1ngel (they later divorced).<ref name=\"MPR\"/><ref name=\"L\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Lunna was signed by A&M Records and recorded the following successful songs, \"''No Digas Nada''\" (Don't Say Anything), \"''Ni Princesa, Ni Esclava''\" (Nor Princess, Nor Slave) and \"''Fugitiva Amante''\" (Fugitive Lover).

Richard Sharpe ([[Sean Bean]]) is mourning the death of his wife Teresa.\n\nSharpe's archenemy, French Major Ducos (Feodor Atkine), proposes a plan to his emperor to split the alliance between Spain and England (and gain revenge on Sharpe). He has a French spy, la Marquesa ([[Alice Krige]]), write a letter to her Spanish husband claiming that Sharpe tried to force his unwanted attentions on her. Sharpe is forced into a duel with the outraged nobleman, but the fight is broken up by Wellington's men. Later that night, while he is sleeping, the Spaniard has his throat cut by El Matarife ([[Matthew Scurfield]]), a [[partisan (military)|partisan]] leader.

Sharpe learns of this and frees her, only to be chased by El Matarife and his men.\n\nSharpe is captured by a French patrol and taken to Ducos.

Harper and the rest of Sharpe's \"chosen men\" infiltrate the French prison in disguise and rescue their commander, just in time for him to play a pivotal role in the British victory at the [[Battle of Vitoria]].

Shown on [[ITV Network|ITV]] in 1993, the adaptation stars [[Sean Bean]], [[Daragh O'Malley]] and [[Assumpta Serna]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1809, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]], commander of the British forces in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], prepares to invade French-controlled Spain. He orders Lieutenant [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]] and his band of \"chosen men\" to accompany the arrogantly incompetent, newly arrived [[Sir Henry Simmerson]] and his [[South Essex Regiment]] on a small, but significant mission to destroy a bridge vital to French troop movements. Simmerson, his nephew Lieutenant Gibbons ([[Neil Dudgeon]]) and Lieutenant Berry ([[Daniel Craig]]) despise Sharpe for his low birth. However, Major Lennox ([[David Ashton (actor)|David Ashton]]), who knew Sharpe from their days in India, and American-born Captain Leroy ([[Gavan O'Herlihy]]) appreciate his military skill and sense of honour.\n\nThe bridge is taken without resistance and Sharpe's men start to place explosives. When Simmerson spots a small French patrol on the other side of the river, he orders Lennox to take a small detachment and drive them off. Lennox strenuously objects, but obeys the command. His fears are realised when a hidden French cavalry unit surprises and overruns the British instead; Lennox is fatally wounded and the [[Regimental Colour|King's colours]] are lost. Sharpe and his men go to the rescue, while Simmerson panics and orders the bridge to be blown up, even though some of his men are still on the other side. Afterwards, the dying Lennox asks Sharpe for a [[French Imperial Eagle]] to wash away the shame of losing the colours.\n\nWellesley promotes Sharpe to captain for his part in the skirmish, instead of Gibbons (though there is no guarantee that he will be able to keep his new rank). Enraged, Simmerson tells Berry to dispose of Sharpe. Berry deliberately provokes Sharpe by abusing Countess Josefina (Katia Caballero), a woman Sharpe had rescued from Gibbons and taken under his protection. To forestall a duel, Wellesley orders a night patrol to be led by Sharpe and Berry. They run into the French; during the fighting, Berry shoots Sharpe from behind, but is killed by Harper before he can finish the job.\n\nThe next day, the [[Battle of Talavera]] is fought. Simmerson, seeing a French column approaching his position, flees. Sharpe steadies the South Essex, much improved after the training he provided, and leaves them under the command of Leroy. They succeed in stopping the French attack. At just the right moment, Sharpe and his riflemen attack the wavering French soldiers in the flank, sending them into headlong retreat. Sharpe captures the unit's Eagle, making him famous throughout England and ensuring that he remains a captain.\n\nAfterwards, Sharpe plants the Eagle on Lennox's grave. Simmerson is protected by his influential friends and escapes punishment for his cowardice and incompetence. Meanwhile, Josefina finds a new protector in Captain Leroy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]]\n* [[Daragh O'Malley]] as Sergeant  [[Patrick Harper (fiction)|Patrick Harper]]\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as [[Teresa Moreno|Comandante Teresa Moreno]]\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Major Michael Hogan\n* [[David Troughton]] as [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Lord Wellington]]\n* [[Michael Cochrane]] as [[Sir Henry Simmerson]]\n* [[Martin Jacobs]] as [[William Lawford|Colonel Lawford]]\n* [[Katia Caballero]]  as Countess Josefina\n* [[Michael Mears]] as Rifleman Francis Cooper\n* [[John Tams]] as [[Daniel Hagman|Rifleman Daniel Hagman]]\n* [[Jason Salkey]] as [[Sergeant Harris|Rifleman Harris]]\n* [[Lyndon Davies]] as Rifleman Ben Perkins\n* Paul Trussell as Rifleman Isaiah Tongue\n* [[Gavan O'Herlihy]] as [[Thomas Leroy|Captain Leroy]] \n* [[David Ashton (actor)|David Ashton]] as Major Lennox\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Lieutenant Gibbons\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Lieutenant Berry\n* [[Nolan Hemmings]] as Ensign Denny\n* [[Paul Bigley]] as Dobbs\n\nIt was David Troughton's second and last appearance as Sir Arthur Wellesley; due to illness, he was replaced by [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]. Brian Cox would also leave the series after this film, due to poor working conditions in [[Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} He was replaced by [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]], playing a different character. Paul Trussell's character of Isaiah Tongue does not appear in later episodes.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nWhile both the novel and the film follow a similar plot, many of the characters and events are altered from the former, often in order to minimise production costs. An incomplete list follows:\n\n* In the novel, Sharpe brings with him a force of thirty riflemen to the South Essex, who remain with him throughout the course of the books. In the film, this number is trimmed down significantly, as only the Chosen Men (Lance-Corporals) plus Sgt. Harper are featured.\n* The character of Teresa had yet to be introduced by the time ''Sharpe's Eagle'' was written, appearing in the subsequent ''Sharpe's Gold''. In the film, Teresa is present throughout many events of the plot, and the relationship between Sharpe and Josefina is scrapped as a result.\n* The character of Captain Thomas Leroy is significantly different in the film, adding in a subplot that he has found wealth as a slave-trader. While the Leroy featured in the novel has been a merchant and gained wealth from it, no mention of slave-trading is made whatsoever.\n* The bridge at [[Valdelacasa]] is an old Roman stone bridge in the novel, rather than the wooden design featured in the film. The battle that takes place there is also heavily altered; the Spanish take no part in the fighting, the battle between the South Essex and the French dragoons is of a much smaller scale, with only a few dozen men participating rather than hundreds on each side, and Sharpe's capture of the French cannon is written out.\n* In the book, Gibbons is killed by Harper at Talavera when he attacks Sharpe, whereas in the film he flees with Simmerson and survives. The death of Berry in the film is an amalgamation of the deaths of Gibbons and Berry from the book: The novel has Sharpe luring Berry off to a secluded spot under the cover of a French attack and stabbing him through the throat with his sword.\n\n==See also==\n* [[South Essex Regiment]]\n* [[Over the Hills and Far Away (traditional)]]\n* [[Sharpe's Eagle (novel)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0108107|title=Sharpe's Eagle}}\n* {{tv.com episode|sharpe/sharpes-eagle-197765|Sharpe's Eagle}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194212/http://www.sharpefilm.com/eagle/index.html Sharpe's Eagle at SharpeFilm.com]\n\n{{Bernard Cornwell}}\n\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:1990s war films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on historical novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on military novels]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars films]]\n[[Category:Sharpe (TV series)|Eagle]]\n[[Category:War television films]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1809]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Sharpe's Eagle\n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = ''Title screen of Sharpe's Eagle''.\n| genre                = \n| creator              = \n| based_on             = \n| writer               = [[Bernard Cornwell]] (novel)\n| screenplay           = \n| story                = \n| director             = [[Tom Clegg (director)|Tom Clegg]]\n| starring             = [[Sean Bean]]<br />[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]<br />[[Daragh O'Malley]]<br />[[Assumpta Serna]]\n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = Dominic Muldowney<br />[[John Tams]]\n| country              = United Kingdom\n| language             = English\n| num_episodes         = \n| producer             = \n| editor               = \n| cinematography       = \n| runtime              = 100 minutes<ref>{{cite web |title= SHARPE - SHARPE'S EAGLE |url= https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/sharpe-sharpes-eagle-1993-1 |website= [[British Board of Film Classification]] |accessdate= 2 April 2020 }}</ref>\n| company              = \n| distributor          = \n| budget               = \n| network              = [[ITV Network|ITV]]\n| first_aired          = {{Start date|1993|5|12|df=y}}\n| last_aired           = \n| preceded_by          = ''[[Sharpe's Rifles (TV programme)|Sharpe's Rifles]]''\n| followed_by          = ''[[Sharpe's Company (TV programme)|Sharpe's Company]]''\n| website              = \n}}\n'''''Sharpe's Eagle''''' is the second in the series of ''[[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]'' historical war [[television drama]]s, based on the [[Sharpe's Eagle (novel)|novel of the same name]].

However, Major Lennox ([[David Ashton (actor)|David Ashton]]), who knew Sharpe from their days in India, and American-born Captain Leroy ([[Gavan O'Herlihy]]) appreciate his military skill and sense of honour.\n\nThe bridge is taken without resistance and Sharpe's men start to place explosives. When Simmerson spots a small French patrol on the other side of the river, he orders Lennox to take a small detachment and drive them off. Lennox strenuously objects, but obeys the command. His fears are realised when a hidden French cavalry unit surprises and overruns the British instead; Lennox is fatally wounded and the [[Regimental Colour|King's colours]] are lost. Sharpe and his men go to the rescue, while Simmerson panics and orders the bridge to be blown up, even though some of his men are still on the other side. Afterwards, the dying Lennox asks Sharpe for a [[French Imperial Eagle]] to wash away the shame of losing the colours.\n\nWellesley promotes Sharpe to captain for his part in the skirmish, instead of Gibbons (though there is no guarantee that he will be able to keep his new rank). Enraged, Simmerson tells Berry to dispose of Sharpe. Berry deliberately provokes Sharpe by abusing Countess Josefina (Katia Caballero), a woman Sharpe had rescued from Gibbons and taken under his protection. To forestall a duel, Wellesley orders a night patrol to be led by Sharpe and Berry. They run into the French; during the fighting, Berry shoots Sharpe from behind, but is killed by Harper before he can finish the job.\n\nThe next day, the [[Battle of Talavera]] is fought. Simmerson, seeing a French column approaching his position, flees. Sharpe steadies the South Essex, much improved after the training he provided, and leaves them under the command of Leroy. They succeed in stopping the French attack. At just the right moment, Sharpe and his riflemen attack the wavering French soldiers in the flank, sending them into headlong retreat. Sharpe captures the unit's Eagle, making him famous throughout England and ensuring that he remains a captain.\n\nAfterwards, Sharpe plants the Eagle on Lennox's grave. Simmerson is protected by his influential friends and escapes punishment for his cowardice and incompetence. Meanwhile, Josefina finds a new protector in Captain Leroy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]]\n* [[Daragh O'Malley]] as Sergeant  [[Patrick Harper (fiction)|Patrick Harper]]\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as [[Teresa Moreno|Comandante Teresa Moreno]]\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Major Michael Hogan\n* [[David Troughton]] as [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Lord Wellington]]\n* [[Michael Cochrane]] as [[Sir Henry Simmerson]]\n* [[Martin Jacobs]] as [[William Lawford|Colonel Lawford]]\n* [[Katia Caballero]]  as Countess Josefina\n* [[Michael Mears]] as Rifleman Francis Cooper\n* [[John Tams]] as [[Daniel Hagman|Rifleman Daniel Hagman]]\n* [[Jason Salkey]] as [[Sergeant Harris|Rifleman Harris]]\n* [[Lyndon Davies]] as Rifleman Ben Perkins\n* Paul Trussell as Rifleman Isaiah Tongue\n* [[Gavan O'Herlihy]] as [[Thomas Leroy|Captain Leroy]] \n* [[David Ashton (actor)|David Ashton]] as Major Lennox\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Lieutenant Gibbons\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Lieutenant Berry\n* [[Nolan Hemmings]] as Ensign Denny\n* [[Paul Bigley]] as Dobbs\n\nIt was David Troughton's second and last appearance as Sir Arthur Wellesley; due to illness, he was replaced by [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]. Brian Cox would also leave the series after this film, due to poor working conditions in [[Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} He was replaced by [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]], playing a different character. Paul Trussell's character of Isaiah Tongue does not appear in later episodes.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nWhile both the novel and the film follow a similar plot, many of the characters and events are altered from the former, often in order to minimise production costs. An incomplete list follows:\n\n* In the novel, Sharpe brings with him a force of thirty riflemen to the South Essex, who remain with him throughout the course of the books. In the film, this number is trimmed down significantly, as only the Chosen Men (Lance-Corporals) plus Sgt. Harper are featured.\n* The character of Teresa had yet to be introduced by the time ''Sharpe's Eagle'' was written, appearing in the subsequent ''Sharpe's Gold''. In the film, Teresa is present throughout many events of the plot, and the relationship between Sharpe and Josefina is scrapped as a result.\n* The character of Captain Thomas Leroy is significantly different in the film, adding in a subplot that he has found wealth as a slave-trader. While the Leroy featured in the novel has been a merchant and gained wealth from it, no mention of slave-trading is made whatsoever.\n* The bridge at [[Valdelacasa]] is an old Roman stone bridge in the novel, rather than the wooden design featured in the film. The battle that takes place there is also heavily altered; the Spanish take no part in the fighting, the battle between the South Essex and the French dragoons is of a much smaller scale, with only a few dozen men participating rather than hundreds on each side, and Sharpe's capture of the French cannon is written out.\n* In the book, Gibbons is killed by Harper at Talavera when he attacks Sharpe, whereas in the film he flees with Simmerson and survives. The death of Berry in the film is an amalgamation of the deaths of Gibbons and Berry from the book: The novel has Sharpe luring Berry off to a secluded spot under the cover of a French attack and stabbing him through the throat with his sword.\n\n==See also==\n* [[South Essex Regiment]]\n* [[Over the Hills and Far Away (traditional)]]\n* [[Sharpe's Eagle (novel)]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0108107|title=Sharpe's Eagle}}\n* {{tv.com episode|sharpe/sharpes-eagle-197765|Sharpe's Eagle}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194212/http://www.sharpefilm.com/eagle/index.html Sharpe's Eagle at SharpeFilm.com]\n\n{{Bernard Cornwell}}\n\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:1990s war films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on historical novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on military novels]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars films]]\n[[Category:Sharpe (TV series)|Eagle]]\n[[Category:War television films]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1809]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe%27s_Eagle_(TV_programme)"}

C. Fields]], [[Mabel Normand]], [[Shemp Howard]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges.]] Kennedy also played dramatic roles as a supporting actor.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Noah Beery-Tom Kennedy in Man of the Forest.jpg|left|310px|thumb|[[Noah Beery Sr.]] and Kennedy in [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[Man of the Forest]]'' (1933)]]\nFor over 50 years, from 1915 to 1965, he appeared in over 320 films and television series, often uncredited. His first film was a short black and white comedy ''His Luckless Love''. He was in all nine [[Torchy Blane]] films as Gahagan, the poetry-spouting cop whose running line was, \"What a day! What a day!\" He continued making films right up until his death, his last film being a [[Western (genre)|Western]] titled ''[[The Bounty Killer (film)|The Bounty Killer]]'' (1965).\n\nTom Kennedy has been erroneously listed in several film sources as the brother of slow-burning comedian [[Edgar Kennedy]]. Though the two men were not related, they were apparently good friends, with Tom appearing in many of Edgar's domestic two-reel comedy [[short subjects|shorts]].\n\nKennedy was also paired with Stooge [[Shemp Howard]] for several shorts for [[Columbia Pictures]] such as ''[[Society Mugs]]'', as well as appearing with the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] in the films ''[[Loose Loot]]'' and ''[[Spooks (1953 film)|Spooks!]]''. He was also paired with [[El Brendel]] for four shorts, such as ''[[Phoney Cronies]]'' in 1942.\n\nHis television appearances included episodes of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\n==Death==\nKennedy died of [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]] on October 6, 1965.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[The Lamb (1915 film)|The Lamb]]'' (1915) as White Hopeless (uncredited)\n* ''[[Double Trouble (1915 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1915) as Judge Blodgett\n* ''[[Mickey (1918 film)|Mickey]]'' (1918) as Tom Rawlings\n* ''[[Yankee Doodle in Berlin]]'' (1919) as American General (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Island of Intrigue]]'' (1919) as Jackson - The Butler\n* ''[[The Poor Simp]]'' (1920) as Jim Donnelly\n* ''[[Kismet (1920 film)|Kismet]]'' (1920) as Kutayt\n* ''[[Skirts (film)|Skirts]]'' (1921)\n* ''Serenade'' (1921) as Zambrano\n* ''[[Kindred of the Dust]]'' (1922) as Big tough (uncredited)\n* ''[[Our Leading Citizen (1922 film)|Our Leading Citizen]]'' (1922) as Boots\n* ''[[If You Believe It, It's So]]'' (1922) as Bartender\n* ''Afraid to Fight'' (1922) as Battling Grogan\n* ''The Flaming Hour'' (1922) as Ben\n* ''[[The Flirt (1922 film)|The Flirt]]'' (1922) as Sam Fenton\n* ''With Naked Fists'' (1923)\n* ''[[Scaramouche (1923 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1923) as A Dragoon (uncredited)\n* ''[[Madonna of the Streets (1924 film)|Madonna of the Streets]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[As Man Desires]]'' (1925) as Gorilla Bagsley\n* ''The Fearless Lover'' (1925) as Tom Dugan\n* ''[[High and Handsome]]'' (1925) as Bat Kennedy\n* ''[[The Best Bad Man]]'' (1925) as Dan Ellis\n* ''[[The Yankee Se\u00f1or]]'' (1926) as Luke Martin\n* ''[[Behind the Front (film)|Behind the Front]]'' (1926) as Sergeant\n* ''Sir Lumberjack'' (1926) as Bill Blake\n* ''[[Born to the West (1926 film)|Born to the West]]'' (1926) as Dinkey Hooley\n* ''[[Mantrap (1926 film)|Mantrap]]'' (1926) as Curly Evans\n* ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]'' (1926) as The Blacksmith (uncredited)\n* ''[[We're in the Navy Now]]'' (1926) as Sailor Percival Scruggs\n* ''[[Man of the Forest (1926 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1926) as Sheriff\n* ''[[The Mysterious Rider (1927 film)|The Mysterious Rider]]'' (1927) as Lem Spooner\n* ''[[Senorita (film)|Se\u00f1orita]]'' (1927) as Oliveros Gaucho (uncredited)\n* ''[[Alias the Deacon]]'' (1927) as 'Bull' Moran\n* ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1927 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1927) as Capt.

Under the name Raspberry Bang, the group released one song on a 7-inch record compilation to benefit [[animal rights]].<ref name=\"Trouser Press\" />\n\nIn November 1990, Tutunjian's high school friend Andy Bernick was enlisted to play bass and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] student Ben Drucker was recruited to play drums. The band began writing and recording songs characterized by shifting tempos, loud [[vibrato]] guitars played through numerous effects pedals, Tutunjian and Carmody's melodic vocal interplay, and occasional bursts of screaming and other noise. They completed their first 4-track demo in December 1990, and played their first show on January 25, 1991. Because of the band's practice of [[alternate guitar tuning]]s, Bernick took to playing [[magnetic tape|tapes]] or static from an old [[AM radio]] to fill time while Carmody and Tutunjian adjusted their guitars.\n\nIn 1991 Swirlies made some 8-track [[home recording]]s, which saw issue as the band's debut single \"Didn't Understand,\" first self-released as a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and then on [[Single (music)#7-inch|7-inch vinyl]] by [[Slumberland Records]]. A split double-single with Boston [[noise rock]] band Kudgel followed, and the group entered the studio to record another single and compilation tracks for Boston's Pop Narcotic label.<ref name=\"Trouser Press\" />\n\n===1992\u20131993: ''What To Do About Them'' and ''Blonder Tongue Audio Baton''===\n\nIn 1992 the band signed to [[Taang!

They completed their first 4-track demo in December 1990, and played their first show on January 25, 1991. Because of the band's practice of [[alternate guitar tuning]]s, Bernick took to playing [[magnetic tape|tapes]] or static from an old [[AM radio]] to fill time while Carmody and Tutunjian adjusted their guitars.

The seven-song mini-album was a forerunner to their full-length masterwork, 1996's ''[[They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons]]''. The album added more synth-driven [[electronica]] and a few dance beats to their foundations in angular noise pop, drawing some reasonable comparisons to [[Stereolab]] and their [[Krautrock]] forbearers.<ref name=\"CMJ 1996\">{{cite news|last1=Jarman|first1=David|title=Swirlies: They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons|agency=CMJ|publisher=College Music Journal|date=Aug 1996}}</ref>\n\nMore member changes occurred during this time: In 1995 DeLuca left and Gavin McCarthy manned the drum kit for two U.S. tours before moving on to work in his own group [[Karate (band)|Karate]]. Swirlies briefly played as a [[Trio (music)|trio]] before [[Mice Parade|Adam Pierce]] stepped in to play drums. Files left Swirlies to play with [[Victory at Sea (band)|Victory at Sea]] and was replaced in 1997 by guitarist Rob Laakso. In 1998 the group [[remix]]ed songs from the ''Salons'' sessions for the album ''[[Strictly East Coast Sneaky Flute Music]]'' featuring collaborations with producer [[Rich Costey]], [[DJ Spooky]], Soul Slinger, [[Mice Parade]], various friends of the band, plus an abundance of [[field recordings]] as had been tradition on other Swirlies releases.<ref name=\"AllMusic Strictly East Coast\">{{cite web|last1=Phares|first1=Heather|title=The Swirlies: Strictly East Coast Sneaky Flute Music|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/strictly-east-coast-sneaky-flute-music-mw0000598866|website=AllMusic|accessdate=26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132003: The Yes Girls and ''Cats of the Wild''===\n\nSwirles continued as a four piece under the Damon-Rob-Andy-Adam arrangement into the new millennium.

Deborah Warfield joined the band as vocalist circa 2000, also playing guitar and keyboards live.\n\nSwirlies eventually released ''Cats of the Wild, Vol. 2'' on [[Bubblecore Records]] in 2003, collecting new material alongside revamped studio versions of Yes Girls songs, plus outtakes from Swirlies' early 90s recordings.<ref name=\"Tangari, 2003\">{{cite web|last1=Tangari|first1=Joe|title=Swirlies Cats of the Wild, Vol. 2|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7674-cats-of-the-wild-vol-2/|website=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=26 February 2016|date=14 April 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent activity===\nThe group, though sometimes sparse in regards to output, has never disbanded.
