It ended up being the most successful U-boat participating in the war, sinking 224 ships for a total of {{GRT|539,741|disp=long}}.\n\nHer longest serving captain was [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri\u00e8re]]. Under his command, ''U-35'' sank 195 ships, making him the most successful submarine commander in history.\n\n==Design==\n[[German Type U 31 submarine]]s were [[Double hull#Submarines|double-hulled]] ocean-going submarines similar to [[German Type U 23 submarine|Type 23]] and [[German Type U 27 submarine|Type 27]] subs in dimensions and differed only slightly in propulsion and speed. They were considered very good high sea boats with average manoeuvrability and good surface steering.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\n''U-35'' had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|64.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, her [[pressure hull]] was {{convert|52.36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long. The boat's [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|6.32|m|ftin|abbr=on}} (o/a), while the pressure hull measured {{convert|4.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Type 31s had a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.56|m|ftin|abbr=on}} with a total height of {{convert|7.68|-|8.04|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The boats [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] a total of {{convert|971|t|LT}}; {{convert|685|t|LT|abbr=on}} when surfaced and {{convert|878|t|LT|abbr=on}} when submerged.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\n''U-35'' was fitted with two [[Germaniawerft|Germania]] 6-cylinder two-stroke [[diesel engine]]s with a total of {{convert|1850|PS|kW bhp|0|lk=on}} for use on the surface and two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] double-acting [[Motor\u2013generator|electric motors]] with a total of {{convert|1200|PS|kW shp|0|abbr=on}} for underwater use. These engines powered two shafts each with a {{convert|1.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[propeller]], which gave the boat a top surface speed of {{convert|16.4|kn|lk=in}}, and {{convert|9.7|kn}} when submerged. Cruising range was {{convert|8790|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}} on the surface, and {{convert|80|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}} under water. Diving depth was {{convert|50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\nThe U-boat was armed with four {{convert|50|cm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two fitted in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and two in the [[stern]], and carried 6 [[torpedo]]es. Additionally ''U-35'' was equipped in 1915 with one [[8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} Uk L/30]] [[deck gun]], which was replaced with a {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} gun in 1916/17.\nThe boat's [[Ship's company|complement]] was 4 officers and 31 enlisted.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\n==Service history==\n''U-35''{{'}}s keel was laid on 20 December 1912 at the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]]. Its delivery date was supposed to be 1 March 1914, but it was delayed due to development problems with its diesel engines. ''U-35'' officially entered service on 3 November 1914, under the command of [[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]] [[Waldemar Kophamel]]. The lead engineer was Hans Fechter. It sailed with the II Flottille, stationed in [[Heligoland]].\n\n''U-35'' completed its first two deployments in [[reconnaissance]] actions in the [[North Sea]]. In its following three actions, ''U-35'' sunk 17 merchant ships, for a total of {{GRT|25,716}}. Later, it was paired with {{SMU|U-34|Germany|2}} after a battle near [[Kotor|Cattaro]], [[Montenegro]], and sunk three merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|4,067}}. ''U-35'' made two more voyages and destroyed 15 more merchant ships totaling {{GRT|59,409}}. These included on 23 October 1915 the British transport {{SS|Marquette|1898|2}} in the Aegean Sea. She was carrying an Ammunition Column of the 29th Division; and also staff of the 1st New Zealand Stationary Hospital, despite a British hospital ship ''Grantully Castle'' sailing on the same route on the same day.<ref>''Cloud over Marquette'' by J M Smith (1990, Auckland NZ) {{ISBN|047301081X}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1915, with the help of sister U-34, U-35 sank the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']], a cargo ship best known for its inaction during the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] on 15 April 1912, despite being the closest ship in the area. ''U-35'' delivered a coup-de-grace after ''U-34'' had attacked ''Californian'' earlier. She was under tow from a French patrol boat when U-35 moved in to finish her off.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-ships/californian.html</ref> Coincidentally, U-35 would also come within close proximity of the ill-fated ''Titanic'''s sister ship [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] on an unknown date in 1916, but \"conditions made attack impossible.\"<ref>https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/the-ss-californian-and-dundee-scotlands-forgotten-leviathan.html</ref>\n \nOn 18 November 1915, ''Kptlt.'' [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri\u00e8re|de la Peri\u00e8re]] took command of ''U-35''. He led 15 missions, primarily in the Mediterranean, and sank 189 merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|446,708}}. Additionally, ''U-35'' sank the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[gunboat]] {{HMS|Primula|1915|6}} on 29 February 1916 and the [[France|French]] gunboat [[French ship Rigel|''Rigel'']] on 2 October 1916.\n\nOn 26 February 1916, she successfully torpedoed and sank the [[Armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|La Provence||2}}, carrying 1,800 French troops, near Cerigo Island with a loss of 990 men.<ref>{{cite Uboat.net\n|id=3447\n|name=La Provence sunk\n|type=1ship\n|accessdate=23 December 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n''U-35''{{'}}s fourteenth patrol (26 July to 20 August 1916) under de la Peri\u00e8re stands as the most successful submarine patrol of all time. During that period, 54 merchant ships totaling {{GRT|90,350}} were sunk.\n\nShe also sank on 4 October 1916, the French transport ship {{SS|Gallia}}, leading to the death of between 600 and 1,800 men.\n\n''Kptlt.'' Ernst von Voigt took command of ''U-35'' on 17 March 1918. He undertook two patrols, an enemy engagement and a redeployment cruise, between 7 September and 9 October 1918, but both were promptly broken off because of engine damage. On 14 October 1918, ''Kptlt.'' [[Heino von Heimburg]] took command and ''U-35'' was transferred to Kiel.\n\n==Fate==\nAfter World War I ended, ''U-35'' was transferred to [[England]] and docked in [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] from 1919 to 1920, then broken up.\n\n== Original documents from Room 40 ==\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 900px\n|align     = center\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7 \n|halign    = left\n|quote     = The following is a '''verbatim transcription''' of the recorded activities of SM U-35 known to [[Room 40|British Naval Intelligence, Room 40 O.B.]]:<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=3981615&j=1 National Archives, Kew: HW 7/3, Room 40, History of German Naval Warfare 1914-1918] (Published below \u2013 Room 40: German Naval Warfare 1914-1918)</ref> \n----\n\n\" SM U-35.\n\n''Kptlt.''

The boat's [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|6.32|m|ftin|abbr=on}} (o/a), while the pressure hull measured {{convert|4.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Type 31s had a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.56|m|ftin|abbr=on}} with a total height of {{convert|7.68|-|8.04|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The boats [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] a total of {{convert|971|t|LT}}; {{convert|685|t|LT|abbr=on}} when surfaced and {{convert|878|t|LT|abbr=on}} when submerged.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\n''U-35'' was fitted with two [[Germaniawerft|Germania]] 6-cylinder two-stroke [[diesel engine]]s with a total of {{convert|1850|PS|kW bhp|0|lk=on}} for use on the surface and two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] double-acting [[Motor\u2013generator|electric motors]] with a total of {{convert|1200|PS|kW shp|0|abbr=on}} for underwater use. These engines powered two shafts each with a {{convert|1.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[propeller]], which gave the boat a top surface speed of {{convert|16.4|kn|lk=in}}, and {{convert|9.7|kn}} when submerged. Cruising range was {{convert|8790|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}} on the surface, and {{convert|80|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}} under water. Diving depth was {{convert|50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\nThe U-boat was armed with four {{convert|50|cm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two fitted in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and two in the [[stern]], and carried 6 [[torpedo]]es. Additionally ''U-35'' was equipped in 1915 with one [[8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} Uk L/30]] [[deck gun]], which was replaced with a {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} gun in 1916/17.\nThe boat's [[Ship's company|complement]] was 4 officers and 31 enlisted.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1991|p=6}}\n\n==Service history==\n''U-35''{{'}}s keel was laid on 20 December 1912 at the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]]. Its delivery date was supposed to be 1 March 1914, but it was delayed due to development problems with its diesel engines. ''U-35'' officially entered service on 3 November 1914, under the command of [[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]] [[Waldemar Kophamel]]. The lead engineer was Hans Fechter. It sailed with the II Flottille, stationed in [[Heligoland]].\n\n''U-35'' completed its first two deployments in [[reconnaissance]] actions in the [[North Sea]]. In its following three actions, ''U-35'' sunk 17 merchant ships, for a total of {{GRT|25,716}}. Later, it was paired with {{SMU|U-34|Germany|2}} after a battle near [[Kotor|Cattaro]], [[Montenegro]], and sunk three merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|4,067}}. ''U-35'' made two more voyages and destroyed 15 more merchant ships totaling {{GRT|59,409}}. These included on 23 October 1915 the British transport {{SS|Marquette|1898|2}} in the Aegean Sea. She was carrying an Ammunition Column of the 29th Division; and also staff of the 1st New Zealand Stationary Hospital, despite a British hospital ship ''Grantully Castle'' sailing on the same route on the same day.<ref>''Cloud over Marquette'' by J M Smith (1990, Auckland NZ) {{ISBN|047301081X}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1915, U-35 sank the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']], a cargo ship best known for its inaction during the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] on 15 April 1912, despite being the closest ship in the area.\n\nOn 18 November 1915, ''Kptlt.'' [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri\u00e8re|de la Peri\u00e8re]] took command of ''U-35''. He led 15 missions, primarily in the Mediterranean, and sank 189 merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|446,708}}. Additionally, ''U-35'' sank the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[gunboat]] {{HMS|Primula|1915|6}} on 29 February 1916 and the [[France|French]] gunboat [[French ship Rigel|''Rigel'']] on 2 October 1916.\n\nOn 26 February 1916, she successfully torpedoed and sank the [[Armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|La Provence||2}}, carrying 1,800 French troops, near Cerigo Island with a loss of 990 men.<ref>{{cite Uboat.net\n|id=3447\n|name=La Provence sunk\n|type=1ship\n|accessdate=23 December 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n''U-35''{{'}}s fourteenth patrol (26 July to 20 August 1916) under de la Peri\u00e8re stands as the most successful submarine patrol of all time. During that period, 54 merchant ships totaling {{GRT|90,350}} were sunk.\n\nShe also sank on 4 October 1916, the French transport ship {{SS|Gallia}}, leading to the death of between 600 and 1,800 men.\n\n''Kptlt.'' Ernst von Voigt took command of ''U-35'' on 17 March 1918. He undertook two patrols, an enemy engagement and a redeployment cruise, between 7 September and 9 October 1918, but both were promptly broken off because of engine damage. On 14 October 1918, ''Kptlt.'' [[Heino von Heimburg]] took command and ''U-35'' was transferred to Kiel.\n\n==Fate==\nAfter World War I ended, ''U-35'' was transferred to [[England]] and docked in [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] from 1919 to 1920, then broken up.\n\n== Original documents from Room 40 ==\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 900px\n|align     = center\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7 \n|halign    = left\n|quote     = The following is a '''verbatim transcription''' of the recorded activities of SM U-35 known to [[Room 40|British Naval Intelligence, Room 40 O.B.]]:<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=3981615&j=1 National Archives, Kew: HW 7/3, Room 40, History of German Naval Warfare 1914-1918] (Published below \u2013 Room 40: German Naval Warfare 1914-1918)</ref> \n----\n\n\" SM U-35.\n\n''Kptlt.''

The film follows a woman, played by [[Sandra Bullock]], as she tries to protect herself and two children from malevolent supernatural entities that make people who look at them go insane and commit suicide.\n\n''Bird Box'' had its world premiere at the [[AFI Fest]] on November 12, 2018, and began a [[limited release]] on December 14, before streaming worldwide on [[Netflix]] on December 21, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, Malorie Hayes advises two young, unnamed children that they will be going downstream on a river in a [[rowboat]]. She sternly instructs them to not remove their blindfolds, or else they will die. From this point, the film alternates between two stages of Malorie's story, separated by five years, until they conjoin: her attempt to navigate the river and the events that led to it.\n\nFive years earlier, a pregnant Malorie is visited by her sister, Jessica. A news report is on television about unexplained mass suicides in [[Romania]] that are quickly spreading across Europe. Jessica accompanies Malorie to a local hospitial for a routine checkup. When leaving the hospital, Malorie sees a woman bashing her head into a glass panel followed by others panicking as chaos erupts. Jessica sees the entity (while Malorie searches the back seat for a mobile phone) and loses control of herself as she drives. The car soon overturns. An injured Malorie then watches Jessica walk into the path of an oncoming truck, killing herself.\n\nMalorie flees on foot. A woman invites Malorie over to a house for safety even though her husband, Douglas, disagrees. However, the woman goes into a trance, begins talking to her dead mother, and casually climbs into a burning car. Malorie is rescued and brought into the nearby house by Tom, another fleeing passer-by. While recovering at the house, Charlie, one of the survivors who seems to have somewhat comprehensive knowledge of what could be happening, theorizes that demonic entities have invaded Earth, taking the form of their victims' worst fears and driving them insane. At Tom's insistence, they cover all the windows, and they blindfold themselves whenever they must venture outside. Later, Greg (the owner of the house) volunteers to tie himself to a chair while monitoring the [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] to see the entity on TV as it approaches, believing that a video representation of the entity will be safe to see, but after seeing it he kills himself by rocking his chair violently and slamming his head into a hearthstone.\n\nAs the supply of food decreases (and with the arrival of a new survivor, Olympia, who is also pregnant), most of the group go to a nearby supermarket (a difficult journey in vehicle with blacked-out windows using only the GPS navigation unit). Malorie finds pet birds and decides to take them along with their supplies. Douglas soon becomes drunk and boldly announces to all that they should remain in the shop rather than return home, as they have plenty of supplies here. Malorie is angered by this, mentioning the other people left at home with little food. During the argument the group suddenly hears knocking from a door leading to the dock. They attempt to let in a co-worker of Charlie's who is locked outside the supermarket begging for help, and whom Charlie describes as \"a little crazy\". As they contemplate the risks of opening the door, the birds go into hysterics. With the door opened but held back, the infected co-worker, who was not killed by the entities but is instead used by them to infect others, struggles against the door to enter the shop. Charlie, seeing the group losing their struggle to close the door, sacrifices himself to save the others by charging at the co-worker and clearing the door for closing. The group return to the house, and shortly after Felix (a survivor) and Lucy steal the car and drive away, not to be seen again.\n\nOlympia becomes friends with Malorie, and asks her to promise to take care of her child if anything should happen to her. Malorie reluctantly agrees. Later Olympia lets in Gary, a stranger and lone survivor of another group, against Douglas's<!-- dug liss is --> objections. Gary talks of other people outside not wearing masks and who are happy to see. Douglas interrupts the story by threatening Gary with a shotgun, demanding that he leave the house. He is knocked unconscious and imprisoned in the garage. Olympia and Malorie start to go into labor, and are taken upstairs. During this time, Gary (left alone downstairs) spreads out a lot of sketches onto a table of the entities, and starts work on another. Hearing the labor pains upstairs, he places the bird cage in the refrigerator. Tom comes downstairs and sees the drawings, and removes the bird cage from the fridge but is then knocked unconscious by Gary. Having faked his sanity in order to be let into the house, Gary now goes around the house uncovering all the windows. Douglas shouts angrily at Gary who opens the garage door in an attempt to get Douglas to see the entities (though he closes his eyes). Gary then goes upstairs to see the newly born babies, after which he uncovers all the windows. Olympia fails to look away and approaches the window. Malorie, with her eyes closed, argues with Olympia for her baby. She gets it, and Olympia jumps through the glass window. Gary forces Cheryl to look and Cheryl repeatedly stabs herself in the neck with a pair of scissors. Douglas blindly attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun. He manages one non-fatal shot before Gary attacks Douglas with the scissors, stabbing him over an over. While Malorie tries to protect the newborn babies (her own son and Olympia's daughter), Tom recovers consciousness in time to overpower and kill Gary, before returning to help Malorie.\n\nFive years later, Tom and Malorie are living together with the children, whose only names are \"Boy\" and \"Girl\". They receive a transmission from Rick, a survivor stating that they are well and safe at a community hidden in the forest. He invites them to come, but warns that the journey (two days on a river while blindfolded) is very dangerous. The four decide to go to the community but are ambushed by a group of infected survivors before leaving. Without hesitation, Tom runs out to distract the group while Malorie and the children attempt to escape. When the group notices Malorie and the children escaping, Tom decides to open his eyes and shoot the group dead. He is overtaken by one of the entities, but he manages to shoot the last member of the group before shooting himself.\n\nMalorie and the children, with their pet birds (which are kept in a box to provide warning against the entities), make their way blindfolded down the river on a boat. They encounter one man in the river who calls out to them and attacks them, trying to remove their blindfolds. Malorie attacks the man with a knife, and he drowns. Later the boat flips in the [[rapids]], but Malorie, Boy, and Girl manage to all find each other. Later, at the end of their river journey, all three start walking through the jungle but are separated when Malorie accidentally trips and rolls down a hill. The entities attempt to convince Boy and Girl to remove their blindfolds using Malorie's voice. Malorie regains consciousness and pleads with the children to not remove their blindfolds and to come back to her.\n\nThe three eventually reach the community, a former [[school for the blind]] and Malorie saw Dr. Lapham, her maternal-fetal specialist there. There are many birds her, so Malorie then releases their birds and finally gives the children names: Tom and Olympia.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Malorie Hayes\n* [[Trevante Rhodes]] as Tom\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Cheryl\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Douglas\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Jessica Hayes\n* [[Rosa Salazar]] as Lucy\n* [[Danielle Macdonald]] as Olympia\n* [[Lil Rel Howery]] as Charlie\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Gary\n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Felix\n* [[BD Wong]] as Greg\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Rick\n* Vivien Lyra Blair as Girl / Olympia\n* Julian Edwards as Boy / Tom\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as Dr. Lapham\n* [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] as Lydia\n* [[Amy Gumenick]] as Samantha\n* [[Taylor Handley]] as Jason\n* [[Happy Anderson]] as River Man\n* [[David Dastmalchian]] as Whistling Marauder\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n\nThe film rights to ''[[Bird Box (novel)|Bird Box]]'' were optioned by [[Universal Pictures]] in 2013, prior to the book's release.<ref>{{cite web|title=DETROIT PROUD: Josh Malerman|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/08/14/detroit-proud-josh-malerman/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Mama' Director to Helm Adaptation of 'Bird Box' (Exclusive)|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mama-director-helming-bird-box-424753|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> [[Scott Stuber]] and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] were set to produce the film, with ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' and ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' director [[Andy Muschietti]] attached as director.<ref name=thr /> Screenwriter [[Eric Heisserer]] was in negotiations to pen the script.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Heisserer In Talks To Adapt 'Bird Box' For Universal|url=https://deadline.com/2013/07/eric-heisserer-in-talks-to-adapt-bird-box-for-universal-542474/|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> In July 2017, after Stuber became head of the feature film division of Netflix, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had acquired the rights to the book and would develop the film, with [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[John Malkovich]] starring.<ref name=\"bier\">{{cite web|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Sandra Bullock to Star in Netflix Thriller 'Bird Box'|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/sandra-bullock-netflix-bird-box-1202500176/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=John Malkovich Joins Sandra Bullock in 'Bird Box';

The film follows a woman, played by [[Sandra Bullock]], as she tries to protect herself and two children from malevolent supernatural entities that make people who look at them go insane and commit suicide.\n\n''Bird Box'' had its world premiere at the [[AFI Fest]] on November 12, 2018, and began a [[limited release]] on December 14, before streaming worldwide on [[Netflix]] on December 21, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, Malorie Hayes advises two young, unnamed children that they will be going downstream on a river in a [[rowboat]]. She sternly instructs them to not remove their blindfolds, or else they will die. From this point, the film alternates between two stages of Malorie's story, separated by five years, until they conjoin: her attempt to navigate the river and the events that led to it.\n\nFive years earlier, a pregnant Malorie is visited by her sister, Jessica. A news report is on television about unexplained mass suicides in [[Romania]] that are quickly spreading across Europe. Jessica accompanies Malorie to a routine checkup. When leaving the hospital, Malorie sees a woman bashing her head into a glass panel followed by others panicking as chaos erupts. Jessica sees the entity, loses control of herself as she drives, and the car overturns. An injured Malorie then watches Jessica walk into the path of an oncoming truck, killing herself.\n\nMalorie flees on foot, while a woman invites Malorie over to a house for safety even though her husband, Douglas, disagrees. However, the woman goes into a trance, begins talking to her dead mother, and casually climbs into a burning car. Malorie is rescued and brought into their house by Tom, a fleeing passerby. While recovering at their base, Charlie, one of the survivors who seems to have somewhat comprehensive knowledge of what could be happening, theorizes that demonic entities have invaded Earth, taking the form of their victims' worst fears and driving them insane. At Tom's insistence, they cover all the windows, and they blindfold themselves whenever they must venture outside. Later, Greg volunteers to tie himself to a chair while monitoring the [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] to see the entity on TV as it approaches but ends up killing himself by rocking his chair violently and slamming his head into a hearthstone after seeing it.\n\nAs the supply of food decreases (and with the arrival of a new survivor, Olympia, who is also pregnant), most of the group go to a nearby supermarket. Malorie finds pet birds and decides to take them along with their supplies. The group attempts to help a coworker of Charlie's who is locked outside the supermarket begging for help, and whom Charlie describes as \"a little crazy\". As they contemplate the risks of opening the door, the birds go into hysterics. The group is attacked by the infected coworker, who was not killed by the entities but is instead used to infect others. Charlie sacrifices himself to save the others, who can make it back to the house.\n\nSometime after, Felix (a survivor) and Lucy steal the car and drive away. Soon thereafter, Olympia lets Gary, a stranger and lone survivor of another group, into the house, against Douglas's<!-- dug liss is --> objections. Douglas threatens the others with a shotgun but is knocked unconscious and imprisoned in the garage. Later, Olympia and Malorie go into labor. At the same time, Gary works on various drawings of the entities and seems to undergo a trance. He then becomes curious, causing him to peek outside and see an entity, as a result, he goes insane but doesn't commit suicide. Instead, He first opens the garage door in an attempt to get Douglas to see, then knocks out Tom and proceeds to uncover all the windows. Olympia fails to look away and jumps out the window. Gary forces Cheryl to look and  Cheryl repeatedly stabs herself in the neck with a pair of scissors. Douglas blindly attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun but fails, which results in an infected Gary being able to kill Douglas with scissors. While Malorie tries to protect the newborn babies (Malorie's boy and Olympia's girl), Tom recovers consciousness in time to overpower and kill Gary.\n\nFive years later, Tom and Malorie are living together with the children, whose only names are \"Boy\" and \"Girl\". They receive a transmission from Rick, a survivor stating that they are well and safe at a community hidden in the forest. The four decide to go to the community but are ambushed by a group of infected survivors along the way. Without hesitation, Tom runs out to distract the group while Malorie and the children attempt to escape. When the group notices Malorie and the children escaping, Tom decides to open his eyes and shoot the group dead. He is overtaken by one of the entities, but he manages to shoot the last member of the group before shooting himself.\n\nMalorie, the children, and their pet birds, which are being carried in a box to provide a warning against the entity, make their way blindfolded down the river on a boat. The boat flips in the [[rapids]], but Malorie, Boy, and Girl manage to all find each other. Soon after, all three are separated when Malorie accidentally slides down a hill and the entities attempt to convince Boy and Girl to remove their blindfolds using Malorie's voice. Malorie regains consciousness and asks the children to fight the urge and come back to her.\n\nThe three eventually reach the community, a former [[school for the blind]] and Malorie saw Dr. Lapham, her maternal-fetal specialist there. She then releases the birds and finally gives the children names: Tom and Olympia.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Malorie Hayes\n* [[Trevante Rhodes]] as Tom\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Cheryl\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Douglas\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Jessica Hayes\n* [[Rosa Salazar]] as Lucy\n* [[Danielle Macdonald]] as Olympia\n* [[Lil Rel Howery]] as Charlie\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Gary\n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Felix\n* [[BD Wong]] as Greg\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Rick\n* Vivien Lyra Blair as Girl / Olympia\n* Julian Edwards as Boy / Tom\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as Dr. Lapham\n* [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] as Lydia\n* [[Amy Gumenick]] as Samantha\n* [[Taylor Handley]] as Jason\n* [[Happy Anderson]] as River Man\n* [[David Dastmalchian]] as Whistling Marauder\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n\nThe film rights to ''[[Bird Box (novel)|Bird Box]]'' were optioned by [[Universal Pictures]] in 2013, prior to the book's release.<ref>{{cite web|title=DETROIT PROUD: Josh Malerman|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2013/08/14/detroit-proud-josh-malerman/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Mama' Director to Helm Adaptation of 'Bird Box' (Exclusive)|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mama-director-helming-bird-box-424753|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> [[Scott Stuber]] and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] were set to produce the film, with ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' and ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' director [[Andy Muschietti]] attached as director.<ref name=thr /> Screenwriter [[Eric Heisserer]] was in negotiations to pen the script.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Heisserer In Talks To Adapt 'Bird Box' For Universal|url=https://deadline.com/2013/07/eric-heisserer-in-talks-to-adapt-bird-box-for-universal-542474/|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> In July 2017, after Stuber became head of the feature film division of Netflix, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had acquired the rights to the book and would develop the film, with [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[John Malkovich]] starring.<ref name=\"bier\">{{cite web|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Sandra Bullock to Star in Netflix Thriller 'Bird Box'|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/sandra-bullock-netflix-bird-box-1202500176/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=John Malkovich Joins Sandra Bullock in 'Bird Box';

The released version consisted of ten tracks, totalling an hour and six minutes of music. In a statement on the Nine Inch Nails website, Reznor said:\n{{quote|Like all soundtrack records we release, we aim for these to play like albums that take you on a journey and can exist as companion pieces to the films and as their own separate works.

In Sydney sandstone, the ripple marks from the ancient river that brought the grains of sand are distinctive and easily seen, telling geologists that the sand comes from rocks formed between 500 and 700 million years ago far to the south. This means that the highest part of the visible lines almost always faces approximately south.<ref>Flannery, Tim, \"Introduction: The sandstone city\" in Flannery 1999 pp. 8\u20139</ref> It is a very porous stone and acts as a giant filter. It is composed of very pure [[silicon dioxide|silica]] grains and a small amount of the iron mineral [[siderite]] in varying proportions, bound with a clay matrix.<ref>Flannery, Tim; 'The Stone', in Deirmendjian, 2002.</ref> It oxidises to the warm yellow-brown colour that is notable in the buildings which are constructed of it.\n\nThe sand was washed from [[Broken Hill]], and laid down in a bed that is about 200 metres thick. Currents washed through it, leaching out most of the minerals and leaving a very poor [[rock (geology)|rock]] that made an insipid [[soil]]. They washed out [[channel (geography)|channels]] in some places, while in others, the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or cross-bedding that can often be seen in cuttings.\n\nAt a time in the past, [[monocline]] formed to the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was thought that the sandstone might contain [[gold]]. Some efforts were made at the [[University of Sydney|University]] to test this idea. Reporting on them in 1892, Professor Liversidge said \"The Hawkesbury sandstone and Waianamatta shale was, of course, derived from older and probably gold-bearing rocks hence it was not unreasonable to expect to find gold in them.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13970915|title=Royal Society|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=4 October 1894|accessdate=13 January 2011|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe sandstone is the basis of the nutrient-poor soils found in Sydney that developed over millennia and 'came to nurture a brilliant and immensely diverse array of plants'.{{sfn|Karskens|2010|p=23}} It is, for example, the \"heartland of those most characteristic of Australian trees, the [[eucalyptus|eucalypts]]\". As plants cannot afford to lose leaves to herbivores when nutrients are scarce so they defend their foliage with toxins.

Called on by the Colonial Architect, for example, to be used in the main buildings of the University of Sydney, the stone was supplied from the [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] [[quarry|quarries]] where there were at least 22 quarrymen working by 1858. Among them was Charles Saunders, licensee of the hotel 'The Quarryman's Arms' who became Pyrmont's biggest quarrymaster.{{sfn|Irving|2006|pp=9\u201310}} Pyrmont yellowblock not only had good hardness, texture, and colour, it was also suitable for carving and so it could be incorporated into buildings in the form of sculptures and finely carved details. The sculptor, [[William Priestly MacIntosh]], for example, carved ten of the explorers' statues for the niches in the Lands Department building in \"Pyrmont [[Freestone (masonry)|Freestone]]\".{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=11}}\n\nSaunders' quarries, known locally as ''Paradise'', ''Purgatory''. and ''Hellhole'', were so named by the Scottish quarrymen who worked there in the 1850s. The names related to the degree of difficulty in working the stone and its quality. The best stone was 'Paradise', a soft rock that is easy to carve and weathers to a warm, golden straw colour.<ref name=\"Paradise, purgatory, hellhole names\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/paradise.php|title=Paradise, Purgatory and Hellhole: a history of Pyrmont and Ultimo|accessdate=14 January 2011|author=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney|year=2006|work=Exhibition: 19 March 2005 to 16 October 2006|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney}}</ref>{{sfn|Irving|2006}} The Paradise quarry was near present-day Quarry Master and Saunders Streets, Purgatory quarry was<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13856664|title=Inquests|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=12 April 1892|accessdate=13 January 2011|page=3}}</ref> near present-day Pyrmont Bridge Road, and Hellhole was where Jones Street now is, near Fig Street.<ref name=\"Powerhouse map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/paradise_map.php|title=Map of Pyrmont and Ultimo|accessdate=14 January 2011|author=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney|year=2006|publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney}}</ref> Before World War I, quarries opened up in other Sydney suburbs, such as [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]], [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] and [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]].{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=62}}\n\nThe men who worked the stone were highly skilled and organised.

In 1908 questions were asked in the Legislative Assembly in the parliament of New South Wales about how likely the men cutting sandstone in Sydney were to contracting the disease and whether the Government should grant medical aid to them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15014602|title=Stonemasons' Phthisis|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=13 August 1908|accessdate=14 January 2011|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Early building===\n[[File:Argyle Cut.jpg|thumb|Argyle Cut]]\nThe early administrators of the colony at Sydney Cove sent groups of prisoners to an area nearby, named [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]], to eke out what ever existence they could from the land and build housing for themselves. These first occupants hewed out sandstone from the outcrops and built simple houses. Convicts were also employed tunnelling through what is called the 'Argyle Cut' in The Rocks. The rock was dumped in the [[mangrove]] swamps at the head of the [[Tank Stream]] to begin to make [[Circular Quay]]. Later development in The Rocks area led to [[bond store]]s and [[warehouse]]s being built on the bay, with better housing and [[pub]]s for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] to create a dry dock on the island.\n\n<blockquote> In the early days settlers found at hand a convenient substitute for stone in the hardwoods, and in Sydney sandstone was so plentiful and so easily worked that no one thought of going afield to explore for something better, and even today [1915] freestone, as the sandstone is often called, is nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15586091|title=Buildings and Works|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=6 April 1915|accessdate=14 January 2011|page=4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDemand for Pyrmont stone surged in the years following the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] when prosperity meant that many public and private buildings were constructed. From the 1870s, various building sites had up to 300 masons working and carving the stone. Historians have reported that during this period, there were more masons working in Sydney than the whole of Europe. It was estimated that by 1928 total production of dressed sandstone from Pyrmont was more than half a million cubic yards (about 460,000 cubic metres) and much was carted away to build other places.{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=60}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1999|p=63}}\n\nThe main public buildings in Sydney, completed from the 1850s until the 20th century were built in sandstone from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] where some 50 quarries operated. In 1909, for example, when an enquiry was undertaken about remodelling the [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliamentary]] Buildings in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] it was reported that \"the external work, excepting the southern flank, was to be carried out in Sydney sandstone and the main flight of steps in stone obtained from the Purgatory quarry\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15028993|title=Parliament House|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=NSW|date=16 January 1909|accessdate=13 January 2011|page=11}}</ref> \n\nMany of Sydney's early sandstone buildings remain but many have been demolished. Demolished buildings include: Vickery's Warehouse, Pitt Street; Robert C. Swan & Co warehouse, Pitt Street, Mason Bros stores, Spring Street; Harrison Jones & Devlin warehouse, Macquarie Place; Mutual Life building, George Street; The Union Club, Bligh Street.{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=57}}\n\n===Declining stock and changing attitudes===\n[[File:19th century Sydney sandstone wall.jpg|thumb|Weathered 19th century wall of Sydney sandstone]]\nQuarries were being worked out by the end of the 19th century and cutting the stone became more difficult than before as depths increased. The combination of slowing demand and technical difficulties forced quarries out of business,{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=41}} although restorations and extensions of important public buildings still required Sydney sandstone. After the Saunders quarries closed, Pyrmont yellowblock sandstone was no longer available.\n\nThe stone was still appreciated in the 20th century. In 1938, for example, appreciation of the stone prompted criticism of proposals to use brick in Sydney especially in [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]]. \"It Is doubtful if any country In the world has a building stone more perfectly suited for church building than our Sydney sandstone, even for the most delicate and intricate tracery.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17424574 |title=Letters |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 February 1938 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=8}}</ref> By the middle of the 20th century, when new modern building materials, such as steel and structural reinforced concrete, had begun to be used, sandstone use had changed. \n\nBy 1953, sandstone was \"the rock foundation of most suburban gardens\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18355566 |title=Flagstones in your garden |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 February 1953 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=7 }}</ref> Sandstone buildings were considered old-fashioned and many were demolished. Some gained a reprieve after much debate. The [[Queen Victoria Building]], for example, a grand and ornate building occupying an entire Sydney block and faced with Pyrmont stone, was threatened with demolition and replacement by a car park.{{sfn|Shaw|1987|p=78}} A great debate among supporters and opponents of demolition followed. One architect, Elias Duek-Cohen, referred to its material in his defence of the building: 'It has a fine facade in warm-coloured stone ... forming a richly modelled surface'.<ref>Shaw, 1987 p. 86</ref> Demolition of sandstone buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] was forestalled in part because of a [[Green Ban]].\nA revival began when the heritage value of these older buildings was recognised.\n\nContemporary reports have noted the contribution of sandstone quarrying to ecological degradation.{{sfn|Broadbent|2010|p=584}} \"Sandstone quarrying is very detrimental to native flora and fauna. It destroys habitat, alters landform, drainage and soil conditions, creates waste pollution, and usually generates noise and dust ...

Six kilometres of sandstone and shale lie under Sydney. In Sydney sandstone, the ripple marks from the ancient river that brought the grains of sand are distinctive and easily seen, telling geologists that the sand comes from rocks formed between 500 and 700 million years ago far to the south. This means that the highest part of the visible lines almost always faces approximately south.<ref>Flannery, Tim, \"Introduction: The sandstone city\" in Flannery 1999 pp. 8\u20139</ref> It is a very porous stone and acts as a giant filter. It is composed of very pure [[silicon dioxide|silica]] grains and a small amount of the iron mineral [[siderite]] in varying proportions, bound with a clay matrix.<ref>Flannery, Tim; 'The Stone', in Deirmendjian, 2002.</ref> It oxidises to the warm yellow-brown colour that is notable in the buildings which are constructed of it.\n\nThe sand was washed from [[Broken Hill]], and laid down in a bed that is about 200 metres thick. Currents washed through it, leaching out most of the minerals and leaving a very poor [[rock (geology)|rock]] that made an insipid [[soil]]. They washed out [[channel (geography)|channels]] in some places, while in others, the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or cross-bedding that can often be seen in cuttings.\n\nAt a time in the past, [[monocline]] formed to the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was thought that the sandstone might contain [[gold]]. Some efforts were made at the [[University of Sydney|University]] to test this idea. Reporting on them in 1892, Professor Liversidge said \"The Hawkesbury sandstone and Waianamatta shale was, of course, derived from older and probably gold-bearing rocks hence it was not unreasonable to expect to find gold in them.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13970915|title=Royal Society|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=4 October 1894|accessdate=13 January 2011|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe sandstone is the basis of the nutrient-poor soils found in Sydney that developed over millennia and 'came to nurture a brilliant and immensely diverse array of plants'.{{sfn|Karskens|2010|p=23}} It is, for example, the \"heartland of those most characteristic of Australian trees, the [[eucalyptus|eucalypts]]\".

Called on by the Colonial Architect, for example, to be used in the main buildings of the University of Sydney, the stone was supplied from the [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] [[quarry|quarries]] where there were at least 22 quarrymen working by 1858. Among them was Charles Saunders, licensee of the hotel 'The Quarryman's Arms' who became Pyrmont's biggest quarrymaster.{{sfn|Irving|2006|pp=9\u201310}} Pyrmont yellowblock not only had good hardness, texture, and colour, it was also suitable for carving and so it could be incorporated into buildings in the form of sculptures and finely carved details. The sculptor, [[William Priestly MacIntosh]], for example, carved ten of the explorers' statues for the niches in the Lands Department building in \"Pyrmont [[Freestone (masonry)|Freestone]]\".{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=11}}\n\nSaunders' quarries, known locally as ''Paradise'', ''Purgatory''. and ''Hellhole'', were so named by the Scottish quarrymen who worked there in the 1850s.

The rock was dumped in the [[mangrove]] swamps at the head of the [[Tank Stream]] to begin to make [[Circular Quay]]. Later development in The Rocks area led to [[bond store]]s and [[warehouse]]s being built on the bay, with better housing and [[pub]]s for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] to create a dry dock on the island.\n\n<blockquote> In the early days settlers found at hand a convenient substitute for stone in the hardwoods, and in Sydney sandstone was so plentiful and so easily worked that no one thought of going afield to explore for something better, and even today [1915] freestone, as the sandstone is often called, is nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15586091|title=Buildings and Works|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=6 April 1915|accessdate=14 January 2011|page=4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDemand for Pyrmont stone surged in the years following the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] when prosperity meant that many public and private buildings were constructed. From the 1870s, various building sites had up to 300 masons working and carving the stone. Historians have reported that during this period, there were more masons working in Sydney than the whole of Europe. It was estimated that by 1928 total production of dressed sandstone from Pyrmont was more than half a million cubic yards (about 460,000 cubic metres) and much was carted away to build other places.{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=60}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1999|p=63}}\n\nThe main public buildings in Sydney, completed from the 1850s until the 20th century were built in sandstone from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] where some 50 quarries operated. In 1909, for example, when an enquiry was undertaken about remodelling the [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliamentary]] Buildings in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] it was reported that \"the external work, excepting the southern flank, was to be carried out in Sydney sandstone and the main flight of steps in stone obtained from the Purgatory quarry\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15028993|title=Parliament House|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=NSW|date=16 January 1909|accessdate=13 January 2011|page=11}}</ref> \n\nMany of Sydney's early sandstone buildings remain but many have been demolished. Demolished buildings include: Vickery's Warehouse, Pitt Street; Robert C. Swan & Co warehouse, Pitt Street, Mason Bros stores, Spring Street; Harrison Jones & Devlin warehouse, Macquarie Place; Mutual Life building, George Street; The Union Club, Bligh Street.{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=57}}\n\n===Declining stock and changing attitudes===\n[[File:19th century Sydney sandstone wall.jpg|thumb|Weathered 19th century wall of Sydney sandstone]]\nQuarries were being worked out by the end of the 19th century and cutting the stone became more difficult than before as depths increased. The combination of slowing demand and technical difficulties forced quarries out of business,{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=41}} although restorations and extensions of important public buildings still required Sydney sandstone. After the Saunders quarries closed, Pyrmont yellowblock sandstone was no longer available.\n\nThe stone was still appreciated in the 20th century. In 1938, for example, appreciation of the stone prompted criticism of proposals to use brick in Sydney especially in [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]]. \"It Is doubtful if any country In the world has a building stone more perfectly suited for church building than our Sydney sandstone, even for the most delicate and intricate tracery.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17424574 |title=Letters |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 February 1938 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=8}}</ref> By the middle of the 20th century, when new modern building materials, such as steel and structural reinforced concrete, had begun to be used, sandstone use had changed. \n\nBy 1953, sandstone was \"the rock foundation of most suburban gardens\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18355566 |title=Flagstones in your garden |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 February 1953 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=7 }}</ref> Sandstone buildings were considered old-fashioned and many were demolished. Some gained a reprieve after much debate. The [[Queen Victoria Building]], for example, a grand and ornate building occupying an entire Sydney block and faced with Pyrmont stone, was threatened with demolition and replacement by a car park.{{sfn|Shaw|1987|p=78}} A great debate among supporters and opponents of demolition followed. One architect, Elias Duek-Cohen, referred to its material in his defence of the building: 'It has a fine facade in warm-coloured stone ... forming a richly modelled surface'.<ref>Shaw, 1987 p. 86</ref> Demolition of sandstone buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] was forestalled in part because of a [[Green Ban]].\nA revival began when the heritage value of these older buildings was recognised.\n\nContemporary reports have noted the contribution of sandstone quarrying to ecological degradation.{{sfn|Broadbent|2010|p=584}} \"Sandstone quarrying is very detrimental to native flora and fauna. It destroys habitat, alters landform, drainage and soil conditions, creates waste pollution, and usually generates noise and dust ... Existing features ... can be removed or obliterated, and local waterways affected by sedimentation. More widely, the extraction and processing of sandstone requires considerable energy, with its related environmental impacts.\"{{sfn|Broadbent|2010|p=428}} The impact on the Pyrmont peninsula has been described as an example of \"systematic destruction of ecology in favour of economy ... The peninsula may be an extreme example of what happens when \u2018progress\u2019, \u2018development\u2019, \u2018economic growth\u2019 take the box seats of society.\"{{sfn|Broadbent|2010|p=584}} In 2015 the NSW government proposal to outsource the tasks they carried out, threatened the loss of their skills.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n===Conservation use===\n[[File:Contemporary use of Sydney sandstone.jpg|thumb|Contemporary wall of Sydney sandstone]]\nTowards the end of the 20th century, it was realised that more stone would be needed for future conservation work. The New South Wales State Government established a Centenary Stonework Program to ensure its availability. The program was also a catalyst for private projects as well as conservation and maintenance research.{{sfn|Irving|2006|p=78}} Even though the government rescued large blocks and stockpiled it, shortages continue because developers excavate large building sites and break the material up into unusable pieces. \n\nAccording to the manager for the State Government's Centenary Stonework Program, Ron Powell, \"There is nothing stopping developers at all from just trashing it\".<ref name=\"Frew 2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/this-is-one-honey-of-a-stone-and-its-almost-gone/2008/01/04/1198950075800.html|title=This is one honey of a stone, and it's almost gone|accessdate=12 February 2011|author=Frew, Wendy|date=5 January 2008|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> In 2008, a Sydney city councillor said that planning laws stand, City of Sydney Council can allow the yellowblock to be \"harvested\" but cannot mandate that developers excavate the stone in a way that preserves it.<ref name=\"Frew 2008\"/> Conservation and a revival in use has caused some clashes between principles and practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotile.com/pdfFile/advicetopic/34201053253.pdf|title=Sydney yellowbock: is its revival a blessing or a curse?|last=Swann|first=Jasper|date=|website=www.discoveringstone.com.au|publisher=|access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of the shortages, the revived industry continues to quarry, process, and supply the stone for building, landscaping, commercial, and conservation work in Australia and there are public courses available in [[Stonemasonry]].<ref>[https://www.tafensw.edu.au/howex/servlet/Course?Command=GetCourse&CourseNo=18776 TAFENSW Certificate III in Stonemasonry]</ref> It is now also used as a contemporary building material in major constructions and restorations such as Governor Phillip Tower and the Commemorative Museum, winning international architectural awards for excellence.

For example, in 2012, conservation work was done on the sandstone of the clock tower of [[Sydney Town Hall]] as part of a four-year, $32 million project to restore the building. The capitals on top of the tower columns needed replacement because they had been badly affected by weather and pollution. The work required about 26 cubic metres of yellow block sandstone.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/work-will-put-fresh-smile-on-town-halls-dial-20111206-1oh60.html#ixzz1fnSl1vPx|title=Work will put fresh smile on Town Hall's dial|first=Nicole|last=Hasham|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/old-trade-new-look-stonemasons-carve-town-hall-a-fresh-face-20120409-1wl4w.html|title=Old trade, new look: stonemasons carve Town Hall a fresh face|first=Leesha|last=McKenny|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nA small, highly skilled team of stonemasons responsible for maintaining Sydney's sandstone buildings was established early in the 1990s. Sculptural uses of Sydney sandstone make aesthetic and symbolic use of the material's connection with Sydney's geology as well as its flora and fauna. For example, the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney]] commissioned sculptor [[Chris Booth]] to design a living sculpture (entitled Wurrungwuri) for its grounds, officially unveiled 9 March 2011. One of the two main pieces of the sculpture is a 'sandstone wave', consisting of about 200 tonnes of sandstone blocks in an undulating form reminiscent of the tectonic forces that created the stone. The sculptor says the design is 'inspired by the sandstone stratas it emerges from and, of course, the link to the sea which it cascades towards ... its evolution is from the geomorphology.'<ref>Mark Savio, 'A Living Sculpture' in ''The Gardens'', Issue 87 (Summer 2010/11) p. 26. {{ISSN|1324-8219}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Sydney sandstone buildings==\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Cathedral, formal use of Sydney sandstone in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival style]]]]\n===Sydney===\n====Places of worship====\n*Garrison Church, [[Millers Point]]\n*[[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]] (Architect: Thomas Rowe, from 1878)\n*[[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's Cathedral]] (Architect: Edmund Blacket from 1868) The stone at first came from Flagstaff Hill and then later from Pyrmont.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17463404|title=An untrained Architect|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=7 May 1938|accessdate=12 February 2011|page=21}}</ref>\n*[[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral]] (Architect: William Wardell from 1865)\n*St Stephen's Uniting Church, Sydney\n*[[Scots Church, Sydney]]\n*[[St Philip's Church, Sydney]] (Architect: Edmund Blacket)\n*[[Christ Church St Laurence]]\n[[File:Formal use of Sydney sandstone in Neoclassical style.jpg|thumb|Art Gallery of NSW, formal use of Sydney sandstone in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]]]\n[[File:Qvbsyd.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Victoria Building]] using Sydney sandstone in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque style]]]]\n\n[[File:SydneyUniversity GreatHall SandstoneCrest 1.jpg|thumb|Sydney University Great Hall Sandstone Crest (one of a series)]]\n[[File:NewingtonWarMemorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Newington College<br>Memorial to the Dead, 1914\u20131918, designed by William Hardy Wilson]]\n====Educational buildings====\n*[[Newington College]], Stanmore, Founders Wing & Old Chapel; the colonnade, including its Waratah capitals\n*[[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview]], Main building,\n*[[St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill]] Main building and Chapel <ref>See also chapter 35 \"School's in\" at Geoff Stuart's \"Secrets in Stone\" published in 1993 {{ISBN|0 646 13994 0}}</ref>\n*[[Sydney Grammar School]], Main building\n*[[University of Sydney]] original buildings \u2013 Great Hall; main quadrangle; original Fisher Library (Architects: Edmund Blacket, James Barnet and W.L.
