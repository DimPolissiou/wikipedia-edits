It is also known as the '''European kestrel''', '''Eurasian kestrel''', or '''Old World kestrel'''. In Britain, where no other kestrel species occurs, it is generally just called \"the '''kestrel'''\".<ref name=Mangoverde/>\n\nThis species occurs over a large range. It is widespread in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]], as well as occasionally reaching the east coast of [[North America]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} It has colonized a few [[ocean]]ic islands, but vagrant individuals are generally rare; in the whole of [[Micronesia]] for example, the species was only recorded twice each on [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] in the [[Marianas]].<ref name=Orta1994/><ref name=Wiles2000/><ref name=Wiles2004/>\n\n== Description ==\nCommon kestrels measure {{Convert|32|-|39|cm|in|abbr=on}} from head to tail, with a wingspan of {{Convert|65|-|82|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing {{Convert|136|-|252|g|oz|abbr=on}}, around {{Convert|155|g|abbr=on}} on average; the adult female weighs {{Convert|154|-|314|g|oz|abbr=on}}, around {{Convert|184|g|abbr=on}} on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most [[songbird]]s. Like the other ''[[falcon|Falco]]'' [[species]], they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nTheir plumage is mainly light [[chestnut (colour)|chestnut]] brown with blackish spots on the upperside and [[buff (colour)|buff]] with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the [[remiges]] are also blackish. Unlike most [[bird of prey|raptor]]s, they display [[sexual dimorphism|sexual colour dimorphism]] with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black [[Cheek|malar]] stripe like their closest relatives.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nThe [[cere]], feet, and a narrow ring around the eye are bright yellow; the toenails, bill and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] are dark. Juveniles look like adult females, but the underside streaks are wider; the yellow of their bare parts is paler. Hatchlings are covered in white [[down feather]]s, changing to a buff-grey second down coat before they grow their first true plumage.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n{{clear left}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Common Kestrel 2.jpg|Adult male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' landing\nFile:Falco_tinnunculus_NRM.jpg|Young male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' during ringing\nFile:Common_Kestrel.jpg|Closeup of adult male\nFile:Falco 003.jpg|Female ''F. t. tinnunculus''\nFile:Turmfalke am Neusiedler See.jpg|''F. t. tinnunculus'' at lake Neusiedl\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male.jpg|Male in the wild\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male in flight 2.jpg|Hovering<br>tail feathers closed\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male in flight.jpg|Hovering<br>tail feathers spread\n\nFile:Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) skull at the Royal Veterinary College anatomy museum.JPG|Skull\n</gallery>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nIn the cool-[[temperate]] parts of its range, the common kestrel [[bird migration|migrates]] south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a [[diurnal animal]] of the lowlands and prefers open [[habitat]] such as [[Field (agriculture)|fields]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, [[shrubland]] and [[marshland]]. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternative perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless [[steppe]] where there are abundant [[herbaceous plant]]s and [[shrub]]s to support a population of prey animals. The common kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in [[wetland]]s, [[moorland]]s and [[arid]] [[savanna]]. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to {{Convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]] in the hottest [[tropical]] parts of its range but only to about {{Convert|1750|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[subtropical]] climate of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[foothills]].<ref name=Orta1994/><ref name=Inskipp2000/>\n\nGlobally, this species is not considered threatened by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> Its stocks were affected by the indiscriminate use of [[organochlorine]]s and other [[pesticide]]s in the mid-20th century, but being something of an [[r-strategist]] able to multiply quickly under good conditions it was less affected than other birds of prey. The global population has been fluctuating considerably over the years but remains generally stable; it is roughly estimated at 1\u20132 million pairs or so, about 20% of which are found in [[Europe]]. There has been a recent decline in parts of Western Europe such as [[Ireland]]. Subspecies ''dacotiae'' is quite rare, numbering less than 1000 adult birds in 1990, when the ancient western Canarian subspecies ''canariensis'' numbered about ten times as many birds.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-4.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-2.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\nWhen hunting, the common kestrel characteristically hovers about {{Convert|10|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using [[ridge lift]]. Like most [[birds of prey]], common kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target. It can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. This [[species]] is able to see [[near ultraviolet]] light, allowing the birds to detect the [[urine]] trails around [[rodent]] burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight.<ref name=Viitala1995/> Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the birds spots prey animals moving by, they will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n[[File:Microtus subterraneus (Cologne, Germany).jpg|thumb|right|[[European pine vole]] (''Microtus subterraneus''), a typical common kestrel prey since prehistoric times]]\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-5.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\nCommon kestrels eat almost exclusively mouse-sized [[mammal]]s. [[Vole]]s, [[shrew]]s and true [[mice]] supply up to three-quarters or more of the [[biomass]] most individuals ingest. On oceanic islands (where [[mammal]]s are often scarce), small [[bird]]s (mainly [[passerine]]s) may make up the bulk of its diet.<ref name=Wiles2004/> Elsewhere, birds are only an important food during a few weeks each summer when inexperienced [[fledgling (birds)|fledgling]]s abound. Other suitably sized [[vertebrate]]s like [[bat]]s, [[swift]]s,<ref name=Mikula2013/> [[frog]]s{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and [[lizard]]s are eaten only on rare occasions. However, kestrels are more likely to prey on lizards in southern latitudes. In northern latitudes, the kestrel is found more often to deliver lizards to their nestlings during midday and also with increasing ambient temperature.<ref name=Steen2011a/> Seasonally, [[arthropod]]s may be a main prey item. Generally, [[invertebrate]]s like [[camel spider]]s and even [[earthworm]]s, but mainly sizeable [[insect]]s such as [[beetle]]s, [[orthoptera]]ns and winged [[termite]]s will be eaten.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n''F. tinnunculus'' requires the equivalent of 4\u20138 voles a day, depending on energy expenditure (time of the year, amount of hovering, etc.). They have been known to catch several voles in succession and [[hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] some for later consumption. An individual nestling consumes on average 4.2 g/h, equivalent to 67.8 g/d (3\u20134 voles per day).<ref name=Steen2011b/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nThe common kestrel starts breeding in spring (or the start of the [[dry season]] in the [[tropics]]), i.e. April or May in [[temperate]] [[Eurasia]] and some time between August and December in the tropics and southern [[Africa]]. It is a cavity nester, preferring holes in cliffs, trees or buildings; in built-up areas, common kestrels will often nest on buildings, and will reuse the old nests of [[corvid]]s. The diminutive [[subspecies]] ''dacotiae'', the ''sarnicolo'' of the eastern [[Canary Islands]] is peculiar for nesting occasionally in the dried fronds below the top of [[palm tree]]s, apparently coexisting with small [[songbird]]s which also make their home there.<ref name=AlamoTavio1975/> In general, common kestrels will usually tolerate conspecifics nesting nearby, and sometimes a few dozen pairs may be found nesting in a loose colony.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n[[File:Falco tinnunculus with rodent am.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' bringing food to nest]]\nThe [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is normally 3\u20137 eggs; more eggs may be laid in total but some will be removed during the laying time. This lasts about 2 days per egg laid. The eggs are abundantly patterned with brown spots, from a wash that tinges the entire surface [[buff (colour)|buff]]ish white to large almost-black blotches. Incubation lasts from 4 weeks to one month, and only the female incubates the eggs. The male is responsible for providing her with food, and for some time after hatching this remains the same. Later, both parents share brooding and hunting duties until the young fledge, after 4\u20135 weeks. The family stays close together for a few weeks, during which time the young learn how to fend for themselves and hunt prey. The young become sexually mature the next breeding season.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nData from [[Great Britain|Britain]] shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2\u20133 chicks on average, though this includes a considerable rate of total brood failures; actually, few pairs that do manage to fledge offspring raise less than 3 or 4. Compared to their siblings, first-hatched chicks have greater survival and recruitment probability, thought to be due to the first-hatched chicks obtaining a higher body condition when in the nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Mart\u00ednez-Padilla, J. |author2= Vergara, P. | author3= Fargallo, J.

They seem to have [[radiation (biology)|radiated]] in the [[Gelasian]] ([[Late Pliocene]],<ref>Possibly to be reclassified as [[Early Pleistocene]].</ref> roughly 2.5\u20132 [[mya (unit)|mya]], probably starting in tropical East Africa, as indicated by [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data analysis and considerations of [[biogeography]]. The common kestrel's closest living relative is apparently the [[Nankeen Kestrel|nankeen or Australian kestrel]] (''F. cenchroides''), which probably derived from ancestral common kestrels settling in [[Australia]] and [[adaptation (biology)|adapting]] to local conditions less than one million years ago, during the [[Middle Pleistocene]].<ref name=Groombridge2002/>\n\nThe [[rock kestrel]] (''F. rupicolus''), previously considered a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species.\n\nThe [[lesser kestrel]] (''F. naumanni''), which much resembles a small common kestrel with no black on the upperside except wing and tail tips, is probably not very closely related to the present species, and the [[American kestrel]] (''F. sparverius'') is apparently not a true [[kestrel]] at all.<ref name=Groombridge2002/> Both species have much grey in their wings in males, which does not occur in the common kestrel or its close living relatives but does in almost all other falcons.\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Kinnarsani WS, AP W IMG 6037.jpg|thumb|right|Female wintering in [[Kinnerasani Wildlife Sanctuary]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]])]]\n[[File:Falco tinnunculus -El Castillo del Romeral, Canary Islands, Spain-8.jpg|right|thumb|''F. t. canariensis'' on [[Gran Canaria]]]]\n[[File:Common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), Hurghada, Egypt - 20110923.jpg|thumb|''F. t. rupicolaeformis'' from [[Hurghada]], Egypt]]\nA number of [[subspecies]] of the common kestrel are known, though some are hardly distinct and may be invalid.

The remains of these birds, which presumably were the direct ancestors of the living ''F. t. tinnunculus'' (and perhaps other subspecies), are found throughout the then-unglaciated parts of Europe, from the [[Late Pliocene]] ([[European Land Mammal Age|ELMA]] [[Villanyian]]/[[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[Piacenzian]], [[MN16]]) about 3 [[million years ago]] to the [[Middle Pleistocene]] [[Saalian]] glaciation which ended about 130,000 years ago, when they finally gave way to birds indistinguishable from those living today. Some of the [[vole]]s the Ice Age common kestrels ate\u2014such as [[European pine vole]]s (''Microtus subterraneus'')\u2014were indistinguishable from those alive today. Other prey species of that time [[evolution|evolve]]d more rapidly (like ''[[Microtus malei|M. malei]]'', the presumed ancestor of today's [[tundra vole]] ''M. oeconomus''), while yet again others seem to have gone entirely [[extinct]] without leaving any living descendants\u2014for example ''[[Pliomys lenki]]'', which apparently fell victim to the [[Weichselian glaciation]] about 100,000 years ago.<ref name=Mlikovsky2002/><ref name=MourerChauvire2003/>\n\n== In culture ==\nThe kestrel is sometimes seen, like other birds of prey, as a symbol of the power and vitality of nature. In \"Into Battle\" (1915), the war poet [[Julian Grenfell]] invokes the superhuman characteristics of the kestrel among several birds, when hoping for prowess in battle:\n\n<blockquote>\"The kestrel hovering by day,<br />\n\nAnd the [[little owl]] that call at night,<br />\nBid him be swift and keen as they,<br />\n\nAs keen of ear, as swift of sight.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] (1844\u20131889) writes on the kestrel in his poem \"[[The Windhover]]\", exalting in their mastery of flight and their majesty in the sky.\n\n<blockquote>\"I caught this morning morning's minion, king-<br>\ndom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\"</blockquote>\n\nA kestrel is also one of the main characters in ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]''.\n\n[[Barry Hines]]\u2019 novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' - together with the 1969 film based on it, [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' - is about a working-class boy in [[England]] who befriends a kestrel.\n\nThe Pathan name for the kestrel, B\u0101d Khurak, means \"wind hover\" and in Punjab it is called Larz\u0101nak or \"little hoverer\". It was once used as a decoy to capture other birds of prey in Persia and Arabia. It was also used to train greyhounds meant for hunting gazelles in parts of Arabia. Young greyhounds would be set after jerboa-rats which would also be distracted and forced to make twists and turns by the dives of a kestrel.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Phillott, D.C.| title=Note on the Common Kestril (Tinnunculus alaudarius)|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal| pages=527\u2013528 | volume=2| issue=10|url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753003193114#page/527/mode/1up| year=1832}}</ref>\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name \"kestrel\" is derived from the French cr\u00e9cerelle which is diminutive for cr\u00e9celle, which also referred to a bell used by lepers.

include ''[[wikt:windhover|windhover]]'' and ''[[wikt:windfucker|windfucker]],'' due to its habit of beating the wind (hovering in air).<ref name=OED/>\n\nThe Late Latin ''falco'' derives from

It is also known as the '''European kestrel''', '''Eurasian kestrel''', or '''Old World kestrel'''. In Britain, where no other kestrel species occurs, it is generally just called \"the '''kestrel'''\".<ref name=Mangoverde/>\n\nThis species occurs over a large range. It is widespread in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]], as well as occasionally reaching the east coast of [[North America]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} It has colonized a few [[ocean]]ic islands, but vagrant individuals are generally rare; in the whole of [[Micronesia]] for example, the species was only recorded twice each on [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] in the [[Marianas]].<ref name=Orta1994/><ref name=Wiles2000/><ref name=Wiles2004/>\n\n== Description ==\nCommon kestrels measure {{Convert|32|-|39|cm|in|abbr=on}} from head to tail, with a wingspan of {{Convert|65|-|82|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing {{Convert|136|-|252|g|oz|abbr=on}}, around {{Convert|155|g|abbr=on}} on average; the adult female weighs {{Convert|154|-|314|g|oz|abbr=on}}, around {{Convert|184|g|abbr=on}} on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most [[songbird]]s. Like the other ''[[falcon|Falco]]'' [[species]], they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nTheir plumage is mainly light [[chestnut (colour)|chestnut]] brown with blackish spots on the upperside and [[buff (colour)|buff]] with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the [[remiges]] are also blackish. Unlike most [[bird of prey|raptor]]s, they display [[sexual dimorphism|sexual colour dimorphism]] with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black [[Cheek|malar]] stripe like their closest relatives.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nThe [[cere]], feet, and a narrow ring around the eye are bright yellow; the toenails, bill and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] are dark. Juveniles look like adult females, but the underside streaks are wider; the yellow of their bare parts is paler. Hatchlings are covered in white [[down feather]]s, changing to a buff-grey second down coat before they grow their first true plumage.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n{{clear left}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Common Kestrel 2.jpg|Adult male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' landing\nFile:Falco_tinnunculus_NRM.jpg|Young male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' during ringing\nFile:Common_Kestrel.jpg|Closeup of adult male\nFile:Falco 003.jpg|Female ''F. t. tinnunculus''\nFile:Turmfalke am Neusiedler See.jpg|''F. t. tinnunculus'' at lake Neusiedl\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male.jpg|Male in the wild\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male in flight 2.jpg|Hovering<br>tail feathers closed\nKestrel (Falco tinnunculus) male in flight.jpg|Hovering<br>tail feathers spread\n\nFile:Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) skull at the Royal Veterinary College anatomy museum.JPG|Skull\n</gallery>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nIn the cool-[[temperate]] parts of its range, the common kestrel [[bird migration|migrates]] south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a [[diurnal animal]] of the lowlands and prefers open [[habitat]] such as [[Field (agriculture)|fields]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, [[shrubland]] and [[marshland]]. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternative perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless [[steppe]] where there are abundant [[herbaceous plant]]s and [[shrub]]s to support a population of prey animals. The common kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in [[wetland]]s, [[moorland]]s and [[arid]] [[savanna]]. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to {{Convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]] in the hottest [[tropical]] parts of its range but only to about {{Convert|1750|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[subtropical]] climate of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[foothills]].<ref name=Orta1994/><ref name=Inskipp2000/>\n\nGlobally, this species is not considered threatened by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> Its stocks were affected by the indiscriminate use of [[organochlorine]]s and other [[pesticide]]s in the mid-20th century, but being something of an [[r-strategist]] able to multiply quickly under good conditions it was less affected than other birds of prey. The global population has been fluctuating considerably over the years but remains generally stable; it is roughly estimated at 1\u20132 million pairs or so, about 20% of which are found in [[Europe]]. There has been a recent decline in parts of Western Europe such as [[Ireland]]. Subspecies ''dacotiae'' is quite rare, numbering less than 1000 adult birds in 1990, when the ancient western Canarian subspecies ''canariensis'' numbered about ten times as many birds.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-4.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-2.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\nWhen hunting, the common kestrel characteristically hovers about {{Convert|10|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using [[ridge lift]]. Like most [[birds of prey]], common kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target. It can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. This [[species]] is able to see [[near ultraviolet]] light, allowing the birds to detect the [[urine]] trails around [[rodent]] burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight.<ref name=Viitala1995/> Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the birds spots prey animals moving by, they will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n[[File:Microtus subterraneus (Cologne, Germany).jpg|thumb|right|[[European pine vole]] (''Microtus subterraneus''), a typical common kestrel prey since prehistoric times]]\n[[File:Common-Kestrel-5.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]\nCommon kestrels eat almost exclusively mouse-sized [[mammal]]s. [[Vole]]s, [[shrew]]s and true [[mice]] supply up to three-quarters or more of the [[biomass]] most individuals ingest. On oceanic islands (where [[mammal]]s are often scarce), small [[bird]]s (mainly [[passerine]]s) may make up the bulk of its diet.<ref name=Wiles2004/> Elsewhere, birds are only an important food during a few weeks each summer when inexperienced [[fledgling (birds)|fledgling]]s abound. Other suitably sized [[vertebrate]]s like [[bat]]s, [[swift]]s,<ref name=Mikula2013/> [[frog]]s{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and [[lizard]]s are eaten only on rare occasions. However, kestrels are more likely to prey on lizards in southern latitudes. In northern latitudes, the kestrel is found more often to deliver lizards to their nestlings during midday and also with increasing ambient temperature.<ref name=Steen2011a/> Seasonally, [[arthropod]]s may be a main prey item. Generally, [[invertebrate]]s like [[camel spider]]s and even [[earthworm]]s, but mainly sizeable [[insect]]s such as [[beetle]]s, [[orthoptera]]ns and winged [[termite]]s will be eaten.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n''F. tinnunculus'' requires the equivalent of 4\u20138 voles a day, depending on energy expenditure (time of the year, amount of hovering, etc.). They have been known to catch several voles in succession and [[hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] some for later consumption. An individual nestling consumes on average 4.2 g/h, equivalent to 67.8 g/d (3\u20134 voles per day).<ref name=Steen2011b/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nThe common kestrel starts breeding in spring (or the start of the [[dry season]] in the [[tropics]]), i.e. April or May in [[temperate]] [[Eurasia]] and some time between August and December in the tropics and southern [[Africa]]. It is a cavity nester, preferring holes in cliffs, trees or buildings; in built-up areas, common kestrels will often nest on buildings, and will reuse the old nests of [[corvid]]s. The diminutive [[subspecies]] ''dacotiae'', the ''sarnicolo'' of the eastern [[Canary Islands]] is peculiar for nesting occasionally in the dried fronds below the top of [[palm tree]]s, apparently coexisting with small [[songbird]]s which also make their home there.<ref name=AlamoTavio1975/> In general, common kestrels will usually tolerate conspecifics nesting nearby, and sometimes a few dozen pairs may be found nesting in a loose colony.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\n[[File:Falco tinnunculus with rodent am.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''F. t. tinnunculus'' bringing food to nest]]\nThe [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is normally 3\u20137 eggs; more eggs may be laid in total but some will be removed during the laying time. This lasts about 2 days per egg laid. The eggs are abundantly patterned with brown spots, from a wash that tinges the entire surface [[buff (colour)|buff]]ish white to large almost-black blotches. Incubation lasts from 4 weeks to one month, and only the female incubates the eggs. The male is responsible for providing her with food, and for some time after hatching this remains the same. Later, both parents share brooding and hunting duties until the young fledge, after 4\u20135 weeks. The family stays close together for a few weeks, during which time the young learn how to fend for themselves and hunt prey. The young become sexually mature the next breeding season.<ref name=Orta1994/>\n\nData from [[Great Britain|Britain]] shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2\u20133 chicks on average, though this includes a considerable rate of total brood failures; actually, few pairs that do manage to fledge offspring raise less than 3 or 4. Compared to their siblings, first-hatched chicks have greater survival and recruitment probability, thought to be due to the first-hatched chicks obtaining a higher body condition when in the nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Mart\u00ednez-Padilla, J. |author2= Vergara, P. | author3= Fargallo, J.

Most common kestrels die before they reach 2 years of age; mortality up until the first birthday may be as high as 70%. At least females generally breed at one year of age;<ref name=anage2010/> possibly, some males take a year longer to maturity as they do in related species. The biological lifespan to death from [[senescence]] can be 16 years or more, however; one was recorded to have lived almost 24 years.<ref name=anage2010/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Faucon cr\u00e9cerelle MHNT.jpg|Egg\nFalco tinnunculus alexandri MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.94.6.jpg| ''Falco tinnunculus alexandri'' - [[MHNT]]\nFile:Falcon3.jpg|Hatchling (note white [[down (feather)|down]])\nFile:Falken(loz).jpg|Fledglings in nest cavity\nFile:Turmfalke P1020197.jpg|Immature after fledging\nFile:Pst7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Evolution and systematics ==\nThis species is part of a [[clade]] that contains the kestrel species with black [[Cheek|malar]] stripes, a feature which apparently was not present in the most ancestral kestrels. They seem to have [[radiation (biology)|radiated]] in the [[Gelasian]] ([[Late Pliocene]],<ref>Possibly to be reclassified as [[Early Pleistocene]].</ref> roughly 2.5\u20132 [[mya (unit)|mya]], probably starting in tropical East Africa, as indicated by [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data analysis and considerations of [[biogeography]]. The common kestrel's closest living relative is apparently the [[Nankeen Kestrel|nankeen or Australian kestrel]] (''F. cenchroides''), which probably derived from ancestral common kestrels settling in [[Australia]] and [[adaptation (biology)|adapting]] to local conditions less than one million years ago, during the [[Middle Pleistocene]].<ref name=Groombridge2002/>\n\nThe [[rock kestrel]] (''F. rupicolus''), previously considered a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species.\n\nThe [[lesser kestrel]] (''F. naumanni''), which much resembles a small common kestrel with no black on the upperside except wing and tail tips, is probably not very closely related to the present species, and the [[American kestrel]] (''F. sparverius'') is apparently not a true [[kestrel]] at all.<ref name=Groombridge2002/> Both species have much grey in their wings in males, which does not occur in the common kestrel or its close living relatives but does in almost all other falcons.\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Kinnarsani WS, AP W IMG 6037.jpg|thumb|right|Female wintering in [[Kinnerasani Wildlife Sanctuary]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]])]]\n[[File:Falco tinnunculus -El Castillo del Romeral, Canary Islands, Spain-8.jpg|right|thumb|''F. t. canariensis'' on [[Gran Canaria]]]]\n[[File:Common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), Hurghada, Egypt - 20110923.jpg|thumb|''F. t. rupicolaeformis'' from [[Hurghada]], Egypt]]\nA number of [[subspecies]] of the common kestrel are known, though some are hardly distinct and may be invalid.

The remains of these birds, which presumably were the direct ancestors of the living ''F. t. tinnunculus'' (and perhaps other subspecies), are found throughout the then-unglaciated parts of Europe, from the [[Late Pliocene]] ([[European Land Mammal Age|ELMA]] [[Villanyian]]/[[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[Piacenzian]], [[MN16]]) about 3 [[million years ago]] to the [[Middle Pleistocene]] [[Saalian]] glaciation which ended about 130,000 years ago, when they finally gave way to birds indistinguishable from those living today. Some of the [[vole]]s the Ice Age common kestrels ate\u2014such as [[European pine vole]]s (''Microtus subterraneus'')\u2014were indistinguishable from those alive today. Other prey species of that time [[evolution|evolve]]d more rapidly (like ''[[Microtus malei|M. malei]]'', the presumed ancestor of today's [[tundra vole]] ''M. oeconomus''), while yet again others seem to have gone entirely [[extinct]] without leaving any living descendants\u2014for example ''[[Pliomys lenki]]'', which apparently fell victim to the [[Weichselian glaciation]] about 100,000 years ago.<ref name=Mlikovsky2002/><ref name=MourerChauvire2003/>\n\n== In culture ==\nThe kestrel is sometimes seen, like other birds of prey, as a symbol of the power and vitality of nature. In \"Into Battle\" (1915), the war poet [[Julian Grenfell]] invokes the superhuman characteristics of the kestrel among several birds, when hoping for prowess in battle:\n\n<blockquote>\"The kestrel hovering by day,<br />\n\nAnd the [[little owl]] that call at night,<br />\nBid him be swift and keen as they,<br />\n\nAs keen of ear, as swift of sight.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] (1844\u20131889) writes on the kestrel in his poem \"[[The Windhover]]\", exalting in their mastery of flight and their majesty in the sky.\n\n<blockquote>\"I caught this morning morning's minion, king-<br>\ndom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\"</blockquote>\n\nA kestrel is also one of the main characters in ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]''.\n\n[[Barry Hines]]\u2019 novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' - together with the 1969 film based on it, [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' - is about a working-class boy in [[England]] who befriends a kestrel.\n\nThe Pathan name for the kestrel, B\u0101d Khurak, means \"wind hover\" and in Punjab it is called Larz\u0101nak or \"little hoverer\". It was once used as a decoy to capture other birds of prey in Persia and Arabia. It was also used to train greyhounds meant for hunting gazelles in parts of Arabia. Young greyhounds would be set after jerboa-rats which would also be distracted and forced to make twists and turns by the dives of a kestrel.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Phillott, D.C.| title=Note on the Common Kestril (Tinnunculus alaudarius)|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal| pages=527\u2013528 | volume=2| issue=10|url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753003193114#page/527/mode/1up| year=1832}}</ref>\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name \"kestrel\" is derived from the French cr\u00e9cerelle which is diminutive for cr\u00e9celle, which also referred to a bell used by lepers. The word first appears in 1678 in the work of Francis Willughby.<ref name=Swann1913/> The kestrel was once used to drive and keep away pigeons.<ref name=Weekley1921/> Archaic names for the kestrel include ''[[wikt:windhover|windhover]]'' and ''[[wikt:windfucker|windfucker]],'' due to its habit of beating the wind (hovering in air).<ref name=OED/>\n\nThe Late Latin ''falco'' derives from ''falx'', ''falcis'', a [[sickle]], referencing the claws of the bird.<ref name=SOED>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary | year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press| location=United

By 1988, as the Cold War began to draw to a close, Cuba and South Africa withdrew their troops from the conflict<ref name=\":0\" />. Their withdrawal, coupled with the inability for either side to achieve total victory over the other, forced the MPLA and UNITA to the negotiating table to negotiate a political settlement to the conflict<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n=== The Bicesse Accords ===\nMain article: [[Bicesse Accords]]\n\nBeginning in 1 May 1991, UNITA and MPLA forces agreed on a framework to beginning establishing peace in Angola between the two waring parties<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/AO_910521_PeaceAccordsforAngola%28en%29.pdf|title=Peace Accords for Angola|last=|first=|date=17 May 1991|website=United Nations Peacemaker|page=47|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. This framework would evolve into the Bicesse Accords, signed by the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA on 31 May 1991 in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal|Portugual]]. The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics acted as observers, while Portugual mediated the talks<ref name=\":2\" />. The accords set out a timetable and established certain conditions that each side agreed to meet by the specified dates. There were three key parts of the agreement. The first was the beginning of a cease fire, with the initial stages taking effect at the beginning of May and entering into force upon the signing of the accords<ref name=\":2\" />. The second key part of agreement was the integration of UNITA forces into the Angolan armed forces, which was to occur upon the implementation of the cease fire agreement and had numerous provisions to establish the non-partisan nature of the armed forces<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/AO_910521_PeaceAccordsforAngola|title=Peace Accords for Angola|last=|first=|date=17 May 1991|website=United Nations Peacemaker|page=51|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

UNITA, under the leadership of [[Jonas Savimbi]], claimed thirty four percent of the vote and gained seventy seats<ref name=\":3\" />. For the presidency, [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] of the MPLA was recieved with forty nine percent of the vote compared to UNITA Savimbi's forty percent<ref name=\":3\" />. Despite having a higher percentage of the vote, dos Santos was just shy of the fifty percent majority required to be reelected<ref name=\":3\" />. Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution.

The war was intensified by the direct and indirect involvement of outside superpowers who saw the conflict through the eyes of the [[Cold War]]. The MPLA, which claimed allegiance to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology, [[Cuban intervention in Angola|received direct support]] from [[Cuba]] with the backing of the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist states<ref name=\":0\" />. Meanwhile, the UNITA sold itself as an anti-communist organization, receiving direct military support from [[South Africa]] with help from the [[United States]]<ref name=\":0\" />.

By 1988, as the Cold War began to draw to a close, Cuba and South Africa withdrew their troops from the conflict<ref name=\":0\" />. Their withdrawal, coupled with the inability for either side to achieve total victory over the other, forced the MPLA and UNITA to the negotiating table to negotiate a political settlement to the conflict<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n=== The Bicesse Accords ===\nMain article: [[Bicesse Accords]]\n\nBeginning in 1 May 1991, UNITA and MPLA forces agreed on a framework to beginning establishing peace in Angola between the two waring parties<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/AO_910521_PeaceAccordsforAngola%28en%29.pdf|title=Peace Accords for Angola|last=|first=|date=17 May 1991|website=United Nations Peacemaker|page=47|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. This framework would evolve into the Bicesse Accords, signed by the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA on May 31, 1991 in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal|Portugual]]. The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics acted as observers, while Portugual mediated the talks<ref name=\":2\" />. The accords set out a timetable and established certain conditions that each side agreed to meet by the specified dates. There were three key parts of the agreement. The first was the beginning of a cease fire, with the initial stages taking effect at the beginning of May and entering into force upon the signing of the accords<ref name=\":2\" />. The second key part of agreement was the integration of UNITA forces into the Angolan armed forces, which was to occur upon the implementation of the cease fire agreement and had numerous provisions to establish the non-partisan nature of the armed forces<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/AO_910521_PeaceAccordsforAngola|title=Peace Accords for Angola|last=|first=|date=17 May 1991|website=United Nations Peacemaker|page=51|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The third part of the agreement scheduled the date of a nationwide democratic election, which was to take place \"between 1 September to 30 November 1992\"<ref name=\":2\" />, roughly sixteen months after the signing of the agreement.\n\n=== 1992 Angolan general election ===\nMain article: [[1992 Angolan general election]]\n\nThe 1992 elections, the first democratic elections held in Angola's history, took place from 29 September 1992 to 30 September 1992. The MPLA claimed victory in these elections, taking roughly fifty three percent of the vote, gaining one hundred and twenty nine seats in the legislature<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2007_92.htm|title=ELECTIONS HELD IN 1992|last=|first=|date=1992|website=Inter Parliamentary Union|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2 2020}}</ref>. UNITA, under the leadership of [[Jonas Savimbi]], claimed thirty four percent of the vote and gained seventy seats<ref name=\":3\" />. For the presidency, [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] of the MPLA was recieved with forty nine percent of the vote compared to UNITA Savimbi's forty percent<ref name=\":3\" />. Despite having a higher percentage of the vote, dos Santos was just shy of the fifty percent majority required to be reelected<ref name=\":3\" />. Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution. Savimbi, in spite of the UN mission's declaration that the elections were generally free and fair, believed that the government had rigged the elections and began pulling UNITA's soldiers out of the new unified Angolan armed forces<ref name=\":3\" />.

{"title_page": "Biomechatronics", "text_new": "'''Biomechatronics''' is an applied [[interdisciplinary]] science that aims to integrate [[biology]], [[mechanics]], and [[electronics]]. It also encompasses the fields of [[robotics]] and [[neuroscience]]. Biomechatronic devices encompass a wide range of applications from the development of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic limbs]] to [[engineering]] solutions concerning respiration, vision, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biomechatronics|last=Brooker|first=Graham|publisher=University of Sydney, Australia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-891121-27-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==How it works==\nBiomechatronics mimics how the human body works. For example, four different steps must occur to be able to lift the foot to walk. First, [[Action potential|impulses]] from the motor center of the [[brain]] are sent to the foot and [[leg muscles]]. Next the [[nerve cells]] in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the [[muscle]] groups or amount of [[force]] required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of [[force]] are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's [[muscle spindle]] [[nerve cells]] then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the [[brain]]. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to [[muscles]] in the leg and foot to set it down.\n\n===Biosensors===\n[[Biosensors]] are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's [[nervous system]] or [[muscle system]]. This information is related by the biosensor to a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] position and force from the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] and [[actuator]]. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be [[wire]]s which detect [[electrical activity]], needle electrodes implanted in [[muscles]], and [[electrode array]]s with [[nerves]] growing through them.\n\n===Mechanical sensors===\nThe purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller.\n\n===Controller===\nThe controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements.\n\n===Actuator===\nThe actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is [[orthotic]] or [[prosthetic]] the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle.\n\n==Research==\nBiomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The [[Shirley Ryan AbilityLab]] (formerly the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]]), [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[MIT]], [[Stanford University]], and [[University of Twente]] in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research.\n#Analyzing human motions, which are complex, to aid in the design of biomechatronic devices\n#Studying how electronic devices can be interfaced with the nervous system. \n#Testing the ways to use living muscle tissue as actuators for electronic devices\n\n===Analyzing motions===\nA great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. [[MIT]] and the [[University of Twente]] are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of [[computer models]], [[camera]] systems, and [[electromyograms]].\n\n===Interfacing===\nInterfacing allows biomechatronics devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary [[orthotics]] and [[prosthetics]] devices. Groups at the [[University of Twente]] and [[University of Malaya]] are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat [[paralysis]] and [[stroke]] victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an [[amputated]] leg to control their [[prosthetic]] leg through their stump muscles.\n\n===MIT research===\n[[Hugh Herr]] is the leading biomechatronic scientist at [[MIT]]. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a [[sieve]] [[integrated circuit]] [[electrode]] and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint.\n\n====Robotic fish====\nAs mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a [[robotic fish]] that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish.<ref name=\" How Biomechatronics Works \">{{cite web|url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/biomechatronics4.htm|title= How Biomechatronics Works|work=HowStuffWorks|author=Craig Freudenrich|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> \n* A styrofoam float so the fish can float\n* Electrical wires for connections\n* A silicone tail that enables force while swimming\n* Power provided by lithium batteries\n* A microcontroller to control movement\n* An infrared sensor enables the microcontroller to communicate with a handheld device\n* Muscles stimulated by an electronic unit\n\n===Arts research===\nNew media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100213084238/http://bang.calit2.net/wiki/Mixed_Relations more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157621943139937/ photos], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100204233552/http://vimeo.com/7240418 video]), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100124144847/http://life.calit2.net/archives/2009/06/slapshock-by-elle-mehrmand-and.php more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157620312879150/ photos],[http://www.vimeo.com/5532433 video]), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships.\n\n==Growth==\nThe demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all-time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the \"i-limb\", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints,<ref>{{cite web|title=Touch Bionics|url=http://www.touchbionics.com/about/history|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/future-robotic-legs-180953040/?no-ist=&preview=&page=1|title=Is This the Future of Robotic Legs?|author=Shaer, Matthew|date=November 2014|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine }}</ref>  Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions.

It also encompasses the fields of [[robotics]] and [[neuroscience]]. Biomechatronic devices encompass a wide range of applications from the development of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic limbs]] to [[engineering]] solutions concerning respiration, vision, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biomechatronics|last=Brooker|first=Graham|publisher=University of Sydney, Australia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-891121-27-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==How it works==\nBiomechatronics mimics how the human body works. For example, four different steps must occur to be able to lift the foot to walk. First, [[Action potential|impulses]] from the motor center of the [[brain]] are sent to the foot and [[leg muscles]]. Next the [[nerve cells]] in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the [[muscle]] groups or amount of [[force]] required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of [[force]] are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's [[muscle spindle]] [[nerve cells]] then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the [[brain]]. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to [[muscles]] in the leg and foot to set it down.\n\n===Biosensors===\n[[Biosensors]] are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's [[nervous system]] or [[muscle system]]. This information is related by the biosensor to a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] position and force from the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] and [[actuator]]. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be [[wire]]s which detect [[electrical activity]], needle electrodes implanted in [[muscles]], and [[electrode array]]s with [[nerves]] growing through them.\n\n===Mechanical sensors===\nThe purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller.\n\n===Controller===\nThe controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements.\n\n===Actuator===\nThe actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is [[orthotic]] or [[prosthetic]] the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle.\n\n==Research==\nBiomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The [[Shirley Ryan AbilityLab]] (formerly the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]]), [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[MIT]], [[Stanford University]], and [[University of Twente]] in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research.\n#Analyzing human motions, which are complex, to aid in the design of biomechatronic devices\n#Studying how electronic devices can be interfaced with the nervous system. \n#Testing the ways to use living muscle tissue as actuators for electronic devices\n\n===Analyzing motions===\nA great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. [[MIT]] and the [[University of Twente]] are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of [[computer models]], [[camera]] systems, and [[electromyograms]].\n\n===Interfacing===\nInterfacing allows biomechatronics devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary [[orthotics]] and [[prosthetics]] devices. Groups at the [[University of Twente]] and [[University of Malaya]] are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat [[paralysis]] and [[stroke]] victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an [[amputated]] leg to control their [[prosthetic]] leg through their stump muscles.\n\n===MIT research===\n[[Hugh Herr]] is the leading biomechatronic scientist at [[MIT]]. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a [[sieve]] [[integrated circuit]] [[electrode]] and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint.\n\n====Robotic fish====\nAs mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a robotic fish that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish.<ref name=\" How Biomechatronics Works \">{{cite web|url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/biomechatronics4.htm|title= How Biomechatronics Works|work=HowStuffWorks|author=Craig Freudenrich|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> \n* A styrofoam float so the fish can float\n* Electrical wires for connections\n* A silicone tail that enables force while swimming\n* Power provided by lithium batteries\n* A microcontroller to control movement\n* An infrared sensor enables the microcontroller to communicate with a handheld device\n* Muscles stimulated by an electronic unit\n\n===Arts research===\nNew media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100213084238/http://bang.calit2.net/wiki/Mixed_Relations more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157621943139937/ photos], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100204233552/http://vimeo.com/7240418 video]), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100124144847/http://life.calit2.net/archives/2009/06/slapshock-by-elle-mehrmand-and.php more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157620312879150/ photos],[http://www.vimeo.com/5532433 video]), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships.\n\n==Growth==\nThe demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all-time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the \"i-limb\", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints,<ref>{{cite web|title=Touch Bionics|url=http://www.touchbionics.com/about/history|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/future-robotic-legs-180953040/?no-ist=&preview=&page=1|title=Is This the Future of Robotic Legs?|author=Shaer, Matthew|date=November 2014|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine }}</ref>  Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions.
