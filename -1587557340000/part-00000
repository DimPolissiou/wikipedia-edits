It is also commonly cited because it is considered to be a relatively objective contemporary treatment of the subject.

This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in [[Manchester]] by 300 individual co-operatives in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|title=1862|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205339/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\">Wilson, J.

It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in [[Leeds]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bristol]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Huddersfield]] alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits ([[Manchester]]), boots ([[Leicester]]), soap ([[Durham, England|Durham]]) and textiles ([[Batley]]). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from [[Goole]] docks to parts of continental [[Europe]]. One of the CWS' steamships, the ''Pioneer'', was the first commercial vessel to use the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of [[World War I]] the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a [[tea]] plantation in India.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n[[File:Co-op land, Manchester 1995.jpg|thumb|The head offices for the Co-operative Bank and the CIS in [[Manchester]]'s 'co-op quarter']]\nThere was a great deal of consideration on the role of the CWS in the British co-operative movement around the turn of the twentieth century. Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from them owing to perceptions of high cost (mostly transport costs) and unreliable quality \u2013 some things the CWS were at pains to resolve. In contrast to this, the CWS had its aim to be the centrepoint for the whole co-operative movement in the UK and lobbied hard for loyalty from co-ops. To this end, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to [[The Co-operative Bank]], financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the [[Co-operative Insurance|Co-operative Insurance Society]] in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing [[Co-operative Legal Services|legal services]] \u2013 all businesses which form parts of the Co-operative Group today. It was hoped that these financial ties, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===WWII and post-war decline (1939\u20131989)===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[rationing]] led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods.\n\nDuring this time, the CWS began planning for the future, as even then they could see the potential disruption to the retail market that the new multiple grocers could have. What was less obvious at the time would be the impact of [[National Savings]] and national taxation on the movement, as Britain shifted from a country of friendly, building and co-operative societies, to one with a National Health Service, National House building programs and National Post Office Bank [[NS&I]][[General Post Office|GPO]]. In 1944, the CWS published a report entitled ''Policy and Programme for Post War Development'' which focused on methods for revitalising the co-op movement after the war had ended. The report suggested merging the CWS with the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS); reducing the number of co-operative societies through merger; moving into the manufacturing and production of [[white goods]] and the expansion of [[the Co-operative Bank]].\n\nThis report received much criticism from the fiercely local co-operative societies and the proposals of the report were only partly and slowly implemented. The end of war allowed some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores around this time, while the slow demobilisation of the wartime boost of full employment and high wages partly waned consumer spending power. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942, the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|title=1901\u20131950|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104185939/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite this the subscribed share capital (risk capital) available to societies to innovate and take risks dwindled causing market share and relative quality of the service societies could offer their members to dwindle. Consequently, this impacted the movement by reducing the number of society members willing to enter membership and then actively trade with their co-operatives, leading to further real terms falls in withdraw-able member share capital levels, and in the level or return generated co-operative investment in the form of lower interest and dividends. A corollary of falling market share was continued ownership of freehold land, property and infrastructure, such as warehouses, dairies and farmland (the [[Co-operative Farms]]) built up by societies with accumulated surpluses from the 50 years of growth before the war.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nThe Co-operative Independent Commission (1958) was tasked with investigating the decline in the co-op movement and for making recommendations for revitalising the movement in the future. Its recommendations had two main thrusts: that a strong response to the emerging multiple-store supermarket chains (including the appointment of professional managers)<ref name=myners /> was needed and that the Co-op needed to come to terms with the rise in consumerism and to move away from its association with the \"working poor\" rather than a more prosperous working class.\n\nThis was not to say that the Co-op had not been modernising, notably through opening self-service stores and supermarkets. However, the report suggested that the Co-op needed to become more responsive to the grocery market by being more competitive on price, by rationalising on unprofitable stores and by recruiting professional managers. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the [[The Co-operative brand|first national co-operative branding]], the 'Co-op' cloverleaf.\n\nThough Operation Facelift led to some improvements, the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing a downward trend.<ref name=myners /> Again, it was suggested that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through enhanced economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or were absorbed into either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable, and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.\n\nThe merger did highlight the potential of The Co-operative Bank as it was building a sizeable base of customers (notably local authorities, mutuals and local groups alongside co-operative societies) and this became an increasingly significant proportion of the CWS's annual profits. The growth in the bank largely related to its aggressive expansion into the [[personal banking]] market and with the pioneering of free banking (1972) in the UK, nine years before any of its larger rivals.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n[[File:1996 - Co-op Lisburn Road store, Belfast (12541793775).jpg|thumb|The Co-op superstore Lisburn Road, [[Belfast]], shown here in 1996.]]\n\nThe co-operative movement's marketshare and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 1980s, in part, due to a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the process of [[de-industrialisation]], that had characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns), which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in overall consumer disposable income. This was largely due to the strong increase in wealth and social inequality in the UK at this time. The co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and The Co-op's historic association as the shop for the \"working poor\".\n\nSecondly, redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they had become redundant.\n\nThirdly, the time was a period of notable [[inflation]] and a strong pound, which had led to a wave of cheap imported goods \u2013 this devastated much of the UK's manufacturing industries (including the CWS). By the 1980s, it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and [[hypermarkets]] with hundreds of them appearing across the UK.\n\nThe co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness. In an attempt to improve the collective buying power of the movement the CWS acted to reposition itself from a wholesaler (from which societies can choose to buy) to a 'buying group' (where the CWS buys on behalf of), in order that CWS could increase the proportion of produce sold through co-operative stores that was sourced by itself. Though this did work to increase loyalty, it was not until the 2000s with the development of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group]] that the CWS became the ''[[de facto]]'' wholesaler for co-operative stores.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nDuring the 1980s, the CWS began to merge with a number of failing co-operative societies, having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. These mergers with consumers' co-operatives led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members, hence making it both a primary and [[secondary co-operative]].<ref name=\"myners\"/> The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people perceive the British co-operative movement to be one business, The Co-operative Group, or co-op for short.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===Modernisation and takeover attempts (1990\u20131999)===\nBy the start of the 1990s, the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was in question. This was at a time when many [[building society|building societies]] were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short-term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead.\n\nThe Co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the [[Co-operative Retail Services|CRS]] and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society.\n\nTogether these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if the Co-op was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful Co-operative Bank), the CWS sold many of its factories to [[Andrew Regan]] in 1994 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]111 million in what initially appeared to be a highly beneficial arrangement for the CWS.\n\nHowever, later it appeared that those involved in this deal did so without the CWS Board's permission and had been also handing confidential CWS files to Regan. Notably, one Sunday newspaper printed the CWS' annual report before it had been officially released. This would later pose a huge threat to the CWS when in 1997 Regan posed a highly ambitious \u00a31.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-rejects-regans-advance-1271324.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Co-op rejects Regan's advance | author=Nigel Cope\n|date=6 March 1997 }}</ref> This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previous opposed.\n\nThe CWS, under the leadership of Graham Melmoth, was able to defend itself from this takeover bid, largely by informing Regan's creditors that his hostile takeover was based upon dubiously sourced data and bad business practices. The deal also failed because Regan had greatly misunderstood the CWS' complicated ownership structure, assuming that by paying off the 500,000 'active members' he could gain control of the CWS.\n\nThough this strategy worked for the [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbaggers]] working to demutualise UK building societies at the time, it failed to recognise that the ownership actually lay with millions of ordinary members and that many of these 'active members' were staunch co-operators and who would be unlikely to back the bid.\n\nAfter investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34792/news/consumer/regan039s-out-court-settlement-co-op-group/|title=Regan's out-of-court settlement with Co-op Group|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe shock that Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the reduced hostilities between the CWS and CRS factions which eventually ended with the CRS becoming a member of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group|CRTG]] before fully merging with the CWS in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/670302.stm |title=Co-op merger approved |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2000 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 [[Co-operative Commission]] report, chaired by [[John Monks]], which proposed a strategy of modernisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.coop/newsroom/ten-years-co-operative-commission|title=Blog: Ten Years from the Co-operative Commission \u2013 Co-operatives UK Newsroom|work=uk.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe report focused on improving store design and building a consistent [[The Co-operative brand|branding]] whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive \u2013 the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage'; a favourite idea of Graham Melmoth, which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the Co-op which would further its commercial success \u2013 a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to \"The Co-operative brand\" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-date=31 October 2007|website=Co-operatives UK|date=13 June 2005|title=Commission Paves the Way for Co-operative Success}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the CWS-CRS merger, new governance arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however, was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a [[secondary co-operative]] led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a governance arrangement which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit governance arrangement.<ref name=myners /> In 2014 the governance arrangements were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review \u2013 for more information see the [[The Co-operative Group#Governance|governance section]].\n\n====Establishing the \"Co-operative difference\"====\nThough the modernisation of the business was most noticeable after the 1997 takeover attempt, this is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from \"selling to\" to \"buying for\" co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the Co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before the Second World War. Many leaders within the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example, expanding into [[hypermarkets]] after [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] had already developed a dominant position, but without the resources to compete on price. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its [[hypermarkets]] and [[department stores]] and instead focus on its core chain of [[convenience store]]s.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nAs a further attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of [[Apartheid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/40332/news/social-enterprise/my-story-how-co-operators-led-south-african-boycott-support-mandela/|title=My story: How co-operators led a South African boycott in support of Mandela|author=Elaine Dean|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=12 December 2013}}</ref>), by cementing its \"ethical\" credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the \"co-operative difference\".\n\nThis move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. As a part of this, the Co-op worked with [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] to help introduce the [[Fairtrade Mark]] in the UK. It was an early adopter of the [[RSPCA]]'s 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification. It introduced the first supermarket range of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by [[Cruelty Free International]] as \"not tested on animals\".\n\nThis new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS' changes. The Co-op had been pioneering on notable changes to its packaging with nutritional labelling on food (1985) and later introduced [[Braille]] on its packaging. Many [[own brand]] products were also reformulated to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in order to make the product range more healthy. So successful was this initiative that competitors such as Sainsbury's and [[Marks and Spencer]] began to follow aggressively on these initiatives.\n[[File:Co-op shop - geograph.org.uk - 593466.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Co-Op Welcome' branding from [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]]]\n\n[[File:Co-op Store at Warwickgates - geograph.org.uk - 1098934.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Late Shop' branding on the co-op store in [[Whitnash]]]]\nIn an attempt to build upon the success which was being felt around the increasing public perception of the co-op as an ethical retailer and to implement what was a core recommendation of the 2001 Co-operatives Commission, The Co-operative Group launched a brand panel which was tasked with developing a single consistent national branding standard for the movement. For decades, marketing by co-operatives was confusing for many customers with different societies adopting different store names (notably \"Co-op Welcome\" and \"Co-op Late Shop\"), various shop fascia designs and inconsistent marketing. Also, the cloverleaf design of the Co-op logo was seen by many as too associated with the years of neglect and decline within the movement and hence The Co-operative Group aimed to launch a totally new brand.\n\nThe new \"[[The Co-operative brand|The Co-operative]]\" branding was first displayed at the 2005 co-operative congress and became the first brand which could bring together all of the co-operative businesses (both those of The Group and the independent societies) under a single consistent brand. With the brand came a set of standards which any outlet using the brand must adhere to \u2013 to maintain a high standard of impression with customers. A twelve-month pilot of the new branding followed and these suggested that a significant growth in sales followed the re-branding of stores, largely understood to result from a major impact on public perceptions. Not all of the independent societies joined this new branding however, with [[United Co-operatives]] (prior to its merger with the Co-operative Group), the [[Scottish Midland Co-operative Society]] and the [[Lincolnshire Co-operative Society]] not adopting the new brand design. In combination with the new \"The Co-operative\" redesign, the Co-op sought to relaunch the co-operative membership scheme using a single consistent national standard and featuring the re-introduction of the member dividend.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nTogether, this renewed focus on responsible trading, the redesign of \"The Co-operative\" brand and the reintroduction of the member dividend helped to build the start of a renewed relationship with the British public. In 2006 a survey found the Co-op to be the most trusted major retailer in the UK and almost six million people joined the membership scheme over the following five years. Even after The Co-operative Group's financial crisis of 2013 the 'Have Your Say' survey found that more than 70% of the public agreed that the Co-op 'tries to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion (2000\u20132012)===\n[[File:VG Grocers Logo FAIR USE ONLY.jpg|thumb|180px|The VG logo and shop livery, c. 1990]]\nFollowing the integration of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Co-op-comes-to-the-rescue-of-Alldays|title=Co-op comes to the rescue of Alldays|work=FoodAndDrinkEurope.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a [[Business franchise|franchise]] operation, supplying marketing and own-brand products to independently owned grocers. The Co-op invested significantly in distribution facilities, notably by opening a purpose built National Distribution Centre in [[Coventry]] during 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/category-news/supermarket/co-op-opens-new-ndc/|title=Co-op opens new NDC|work=Talking Retail|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their steady expansion after 2000 the [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Pharmacy]] and [[The Co-operative Funeralcare|Funeralcare]] businesses were performing well, however the farming business was poorly aligned with the needs of the food stores and so was significantly reorganised in 2007 to focus the farmland on producing produce for the business' food stores. The co-op also moved into new business opportunities during this period adding a [[The Co-operative Legal Services|legal services business]] (providing [[conveyancing]], [[Will and testament|will]] writing and [[probate]] services) and an Energy Generation business, the latter included significant investment in renewable energy generation which formed another key aspect of the co-op's drive towards its ethical image. This period was successful for the co-op in increasing its profitability and in beginning to rationalise what had been a sprawling but rather unsuccessful conglomerate. Many however, believed that for the co-op to survive in the long term it would need to merge with other large co-operative societies.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the group began discussions with [[United Co-operatives]], then the UK's second-largest co-operative, about a merger of the societies.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |title=Co-op boards back merger plan |publisher=Boards of the Co-operative Group and [[United Co-operatives]] |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219093136/http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |archivedate=19 February 2007 }}</ref> Such a merger was expected to lead to significant efficiency savings owing to the large duplication of services which the two societies provided.

The basic salaries of the thirteen executives adds up to \u00a34,836,000, with their performance related bonuses adding up to \u00a3240,000.<ref>The Co-operative Group: Annual Report 2012, p. 46</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, \"private and confidential\" documents seen by ''The Observer'' newspaper detailed proposals put before The Co-operative's board to double the wage bill for senior management to \u00a312&nbsp;million a year, whereby the chief executive Euan Sutherland would earn a base salary of \u00a31.5&nbsp;million and a \"retention bonus\" of \u00a31.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|title=New Co-op storm as board awards bosses huge pay and bonus deals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/new-co-op-storm-pay-deals|publisher=The Observer/The Guardian|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2014|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie}}</ref>  ''The Observer'' also reported that Rebecca Skitt, the Co-op's chief human resources officer, who joined in February 2013, left 12 months later \"with a proposed pay-off totalling more than \u00a32m\".\n\n===Member Owner Governance Structure 2007 to 2015===\nBetween the creation of The Co-operative Group in 2000 and the major governance changes of 2014\u20132015, the Group had a complex governance arrangement which consisted of the business executive, the Group Board of twenty people, a series of regional boards and numerous area committees. This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members at all levels of the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions(Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourhoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: Quite a task for volunteer laypeople.\n\nThe Group Board was made up of fifteen \"lay\" member directors elected from regional boards, another five which came from the \"independent societies\" and, though there was the option to appoint up to three \"independent professional non-executive directors\" (IPNEDs) to the Group Board at any one time, only one was ever appointed.\n\nAll Group Board members (excluding IPNEDs) were appointed by competitive regional election \u2013 in contrast, most building societies and [[public limited company|PLCs]] have a nominations committee consisting of members of the executive which picks potential board members and puts them up for uncontested elections.\n\nA series of regional boards, consisting of twelve to fifteen people elected from area committees, were responsible for holding the Group Board to account and for block-voting at the Annual General Meeting. There were 48 area committees which were responsible for representing member interests and promoting membership within their constituency.\n\nOut of the millions of members that the Group had, only area committee members were able to vote in the elections for the regional boards and \"lay\" director seats on the Group Board and the votes were weighted depending on the value of sales within individual areas.\n\nOne of the justifications for this complex governance arrangement was that it took a number of years to reach regional board level, which helped to minimise the influence of single-issue campaigners and [[carpet-bagger]]s. In the 1990s it was these issues, notably the failed take-over by [[Andrew Regan]] in 1997, which caused significant problems for the, then, CRS and CWS.\n\nThe Myners Review noted that \"the primary source of power within the Group [was] firmly entrenched at the level of the Regional Boards\", replicating the roles of the predecessor regional societies in voting a century before, and the review concluded that it was this 'labyrinthine' structure, where Group Board members need to remain elected to Area Committees and regional boards, which led to the governance problems at the Co-op and its financial crisis of 2013.<ref name=myners />\n\n==Dividend and membership scheme==\nThe idea of co-operative trading revolutionised food retailing with the [[dividend]], often known as \"divi\", and the \"divi number\" became a part of British life. The way in which co-operative retail societies are run for the benefit, and on behalf of their members sets them apart from their modern-day competitors. The dividend is a financial reward to members based on each member's level of trade with the society. The distribution of profits on the basis of turnover rather than capital invested is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and most private sector enterprises.\n\n===History of co-op membership===\nHistorically, members' sales would be recorded in ledgers in society's stores and at the end of the collection period a proportional payment would be made to the member. As the societies grew, and the number of members increased, the method of using ledgers became cumbersome. As a solution, some societies, including Co-operative Retail Services, issued stamps to members for qualifying transactions. Members collected stamps on a savings card and, when the card was complete, would use it as payment for goods or deposit into their share account.\n\nBy the late 20th century the group's predecessors and then the Co-operative Group no longer paid true dividend as it had become a drain on limited resources, although several independent societies (such as [[Anglia Regional]]) continued to do so. In the mid-1990s a [[Loyalty program|loyalty card scheme]], in the style of the [[Tesco Clubcard]], was introduced which used the dividend brand.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Grocer]] |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |title=National rollout for CWS reward card |quote=The card which has been on trial since May 1996 is unique in that it awards cash payments rather than credit points. |date=25 October 1997 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |author=Christian Cull |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720184541/http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> These loyalty cards were inspired by the co-operative dividend but were little more than marketing exercises and a way to gather useful customer information. Co-operative customers, not just members, could sign up and receive a swipe card to record purchases with vouchers sent out twice a year which could be exchanged for cash or goods.\n\nIn September 2006 the Co-operative Group relaunched \"true\" dividend whereby a proportion of the profits of the Co-operative Group is returned to members. To emphasise the change, the scheme is now called the ''Co-operative Membership'' and members earn a \"share of the profits\". New members are recruited by allowing them to deduct the refundable subscription for a \u00a31 share from their first dividend. Members can collect points to increase their share of the profits by using the services provided across the whole family of businesses. In 2008, the dividend almost doubled to \u00a338&nbsp;million, equivalent to 2.63p per point (one point being earned for each \u00a31 food purchase), reflecting an 8% increase in underlying profit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&res_dat=xri:pqil:res_ver=0.2&res_id=xri:newsuk&rft_id=xri:newsuk:newsart:1501610241|title=Bumper double dividend of pounds 38m for members of Co-operative Group\n|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|date=27 June 2008|page=21|accessdate=29 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nGroup membership increased sharply in the first year after the relaunch, to 2.5&nbsp;million with many more young people who have an affinity with the co-operative values and principles attracted to join.<ref name=\"2007prelim\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Merger-delivers-strong-profit-growth-for-The-Co-operative-Group/ |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2008 |publisher=The Co-operative Group |title=Press release: Merger delivers strong profit growth, preliminary results |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626103259/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Merger-delivers-strong-profit-growth-for-The-Co-operative-Group/ |archivedate=26 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"3m members\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Co-operative-Membership-smashes-three-million-barrier/ |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |publisher=The Co-operative Group |title=Press release: Co-operative Membership smashes three million barrier |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009132614/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Co-operative-Membership-smashes-three-million-barrier/ |archivedate=9 October 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/news/7297/Co-operative-Group-sees-surge-.ehtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203172342/http://www.talkingretail.com/news/7297/Co-operative-Group-sees-surge-.ehtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 February 2013|title=Co-operative Group sees surge in younger members|work=Talking Retail|date=5 November 2007\n|accessdate=30 June 2008|publisher=Nexus Business Media}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Oxford-based [[Midcounties Co-operative]] joined the group's membership scheme allowing its members to earn dividend at Co-operative Group stores and vice versa. Since then, other independent co-operatives have joined the reciprocal membership dividend scheme, including [[Central England Co-operative]] (merged from [[Anglia Regional Co-operative Society|Anglia]] and [[Midlands Co-operative|Midlands]] who joined in 2008 and 2010 respectively), [[Southern Co-operative]] (2009) and [[Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society]] (2009). This reciprocal membership agreement means members of these societies can earn membership points at more than 90% of UK co-operative outlets.\n\n===Current membership scheme===\nThe current co-op membership scheme was launched in September 2016 and rewards members with 5% of what they spend on own brand products and services being credited back to their membership account. A further 1% is donated to a local charitable or community cause which the members helps to select. Additionally, members will still earn their share of the profits when the member dividend returns (expected 2018). Though the independent societies are not participating in the 5+1% scheme, members can earn the points (from which the profit share is derived) at five of the largest consumer's co-operatives within the UK owing to a reciprocal membership scheme (described above).\n\n==Ethical trading and campaigning==\nAs the UK's largest co-operative, the group plays a key part in the co-operative movement. In the 1840s the original co-op shops were set up to protect consumers from adulterated food and profiteering shopkeepers. Since then the co-operative movement has campaigned on a number of issues which they thought were key consumer interests. As a part of this, The Co-operative Group has long been campaigning for consumer rights legislation, researching into new food labelling initiatives, a major sponsor of new co-operative ventures, a notable donor to community initiatives, directly involved in the development of animal welfare standards and in championing [[Fairtrade]] in the UK.\n\nThe Co-op has traded on its 'ethical' credentials for many years and in 2014 a survey suggested that 70% of the British public believed that it was a business that 'tried to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haveyoursay.coop|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The co-op is particularly known for its work in championing the introduction of Fairtrade in the UK, investing in renewable energy and in reducing its carbon emissions, in maintaining high standards of animal welfare, in being a leading retailer of responsible fish, for reinvesting its profits in local communities and for campaigning on a range of social issues.\n\nThe Co-operative is widely recognised for its commitment to responsible and ethical trading, particularly for championing [[fairtrade]] in the UK.<ref name=\"fairtrade.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/buying-fairtrade/tea/cooperative|title=The Co-operative|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> These commitments and its mutual structure led to The Co-operative Food being awarded ''[[Ethical Consumer]]'' magazine's 'Best Buy' status in 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/food/supermarkets.aspx|title=The most ethical supermarkets.

The Co-op implemented this labelling system on own-brand products the same year. Further research in 1993 suggested that many consumers were confused by the nutritional labelling schemes used at the time. Both of these findings were supported by evidence gathered by the [[Food Standards Agency]] in 2002 and the Institute for Grocery Distribution proposed a new labelling system based upon the [[guideline daily amount]] principle.\n\nAs a consequence of this research, the Co-op trialled a new greatly extended labelling format which went above the legal requirement for what should be included at the time (energy, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, fat, of which saturates, [[fibre]] and sodium) by including reference values for \"guideline daily amounts\", displaying whether each item constitutes \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\", providing information regarding recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables, using the word \"calories\" rather than \"energy\" and for displaying \"[[salt]]\" rather than \"[[sodium]]\". Overall this new design was endorsed by 89% of those customers asked. As a part of this change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all own-brand products which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word \"salt\" over \"sodium\" was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand the difference between the two words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.<ref name=Corporate>{{cite report |url=https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |title=Lie of the Label II |accessdate=2015-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103411/https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-op}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 The Co-operative Group published further research which they had conducted into front-of-pack labelling schemes and have modified their own front-of-pack labelling scheme to combine both the traffic light and guideline daily amount schemes into one simple system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/co-operative-food-research-champions-traffic-lights-and-new-front-of-pack-labelling/|title=Co-operative Food research champions traffic lights and front-of-pack labelling|work=Retail Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009 the Co-op also introduced a 'green dot' scheme where additional specifically defined nutritional benefits in products (e.g. over 6&nbsp;g of fibre per 100 g) were included on the front of the pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/magazine/foodanddrink/healthy-eating/green-dots-explained/|title=green dots explained \u2013 traffic light labelling for a healthier diet|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Since 2003, the Co-op has been using a similar system to highlight products which count towards one's '5 a day' fruit and veg \u2013 also listing the quantity of the product which required to reach the required serving size.\n\nSince 1997 the group has not used \"per-cent fat free\" health claims. The Co-op introduced calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks in 2002 and they also list the caffeine content of products which contain more than 1.6&nbsp;mg in a single serving.\n\nStarting in 1995 the Co-op conducted a survey of the views of over 31,000 customers which suggested that customers wanted to make more informed buying decisions. Consequently, in 1997 the Co-operative Wholesale Society, forerunner to The Co-operative Group, published a report titled \"The Lie of the Label\" which presented a number of techniques which the Co-op accused the food industry of using to mislead the consumer. These included:\n# hiding key information from consumers about a product (e.g. \"products called 'mince' and 'onion', where the main ingredient was mechanically recovered chicken\");\n# using meaningless terms like 'wholesome' or 'natural' to make the product seem better;\n# using unrealistic photographs to make the product seem better on the label than what is achievable with what is actually sold;\n# using claims which make something normal seem special (e.g. dried pasta which is free from preservatives, a legal requirement);\n# framing claims to make a products characteristics seem better (e.g. 80% fat free crisps, when they would have been only 20% fat anyway); and\n# using very small fonts or text colours to make the label difficult to read.

The Group's roots are traced back to the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]], established in 1844.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/| publisher=The Co-operative Group}}</ref> The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was based on the [[Rochdale Principles]] \u2013 which notably introduced the idea of distributing a share of profits according to purchases through a scheme which became to be known as \"the divi\".\n\n[[File:Co-op poster, Town, Beamish Museum, 26 November 2006 (1).jpg|thumb|An advert for CWS candles]]\nAlthough the Co-operative Group incorporates the original Rochdale Society, the business' core for much of its history were its wholesale operations. This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in [[Manchester]] by 300 individual co-operatives in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|title=1862|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205339/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\">Wilson, J.

It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in [[Leeds]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bristol]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Huddersfield]] alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits ([[Manchester]]), boots ([[Leicester]]), soap ([[Durham, England|Durham]]) and textiles ([[Batley]]). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from [[Goole]] docks to parts of continental [[Europe]]. One of the CWS' steamships, the ''Pioneer'', was the first commercial vessel to use the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of [[World War I]] the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a [[tea]] plantation in India.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n[[File:Co-op land, Manchester 1995.jpg|thumb|The head offices for the Co-operative Bank and the CIS in [[Manchester]]'s 'co-op quarter']]\nThere was a great deal of consideration on the role of the CWS in the British co-operative movement around the turn of the twentieth century. Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from them owing to perceptions of high cost (mostly transport costs) and unreliable quality \u2013 some things the CWS were at pains to resolve. In contrast to this, the CWS had its aim to be the centrepoint for the whole co-operative movement in the UK and lobbied hard for loyalty from co-ops. To this end, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to [[The Co-operative Bank]], financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the [[Co-operative Insurance|Co-operative Insurance Society]] in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing [[Co-operative Legal Services|legal services]] \u2013 all businesses which form parts of the Co-operative Group today. It was hoped that these financial ties, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===WWII and post-war decline (1939\u20131989)===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[rationing]] led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods.\n\nDuring this time, the CWS began planning for the future, as even then they could see the potential disruption to the retail market that the new multiple grocers could have. What was less obvious at the time would be the impact of [[National Savings]] and national taxation on the movement, as Britain shifted from a country of friendly, building and co-operative societies, to one with a National Health Service, National House building programs and National Post Office Bank [[NS&I]][[General Post Office|GPO]]. In 1944, the CWS published a report entitled ''Policy and Programme for Post War Development'' which focused on methods for revitalising the co-op movement after the war had ended. The report suggested merging the CWS with the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS); reducing the number of co-operative societies through merger; moving into the manufacturing and production of [[white goods]] and the expansion of [[the Co-operative Bank]].\n\nThis report received much criticism from the fiercely local co-operative societies and the proposals of the report were only partly and slowly implemented. The end of war allowed some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores around this time, while the slow demobilisation of the wartime boost of full employment and high wages partly waned consumer spending power. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942, the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|title=1901\u20131950|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104185939/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite this the subscribed share capital (risk capital) available to societies to innovate and take risks dwindled causing market share and relative quality of the service societies could offer their members to dwindle. Consequently, this impacted the movement by reducing the number of society members willing to enter membership and then actively trade with their co-operatives, leading to further real terms falls in withdraw-able member share capital levels, and in the level or return generated co-operative investment in the form of lower interest and dividends. A corollary of falling market share was continued ownership of freehold land, property and infrastructure, such as warehouses, dairies and farmland (the [[Co-operative Farms]]) built up by societies with accumulated surpluses from the 50 years of growth before the war.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nThe Co-operative Independent Commission (1958) was tasked with investigating the decline in the co-op movement and for making recommendations for revitalising the movement in the future. Its recommendations had two main thrusts: that a strong response to the emerging multiple-store supermarket chains (including the appointment of professional managers)<ref name=myners /> was needed and that the Co-op needed to come to terms with the rise in consumerism and to move away from its association with the \"working poor\" rather than a more prosperous working class.\n\nThis was not to say that the Co-op had not been modernising, notably through opening self-service stores and supermarkets. However, the report suggested that the Co-op needed to become more responsive to the grocery market by being more competitive on price, by rationalising on unprofitable stores and by recruiting professional managers. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the [[The Co-operative brand|first national co-operative branding]], the 'Co-op' cloverleaf.\n\nThough Operation Facelift led to some improvements, the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing a downward trend.<ref name=myners /> Again, it was suggested that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through enhanced economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or were absorbed into either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable, and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.\n\nThe merger did highlight the potential of The Co-operative Bank as it was building a sizeable base of customers (notably local authorities, mutuals and local groups alongside co-operative societies) and this became an increasingly significant proportion of the CWS's annual profits. The growth in the bank largely related to its aggressive expansion into the [[personal banking]] market and with the pioneering of free banking (1972) in the UK, nine years before any of its larger rivals.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n[[File:1996 - Co-op Lisburn Road store, Belfast (12541793775).jpg|thumb|The Co-op superstore Lisburn Road, [[Belfast]], shown here in 1996.]]\n\nThe co-operative movement's marketshare and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 1980s, in part, due to a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the process of [[de-industrialisation]], that had characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns), which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in overall consumer disposable income. This was largely due to the strong increase in wealth and social inequality in the UK at this time. The co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and The Co-op's historic association as the shop for the \"working poor\".\n\nSecondly, redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they had become redundant.\n\nThirdly, the time was a period of notable [[inflation]] and a strong pound, which had led to a wave of cheap imported goods \u2013 this devastated much of the UK's manufacturing industries (including the CWS). By the 1980s, it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and [[hypermarkets]] with hundreds of them appearing across the UK.\n\nThe co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness. In an attempt to improve the collective buying power of the movement the CWS acted to reposition itself from a wholesaler (from which societies can choose to buy) to a 'buying group' (where the CWS buys on behalf of), in order that CWS could increase the proportion of produce sold through co-operative stores that was sourced by itself. Though this did work to increase loyalty, it was not until the 2000s with the development of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group]] that the CWS became the ''[[de facto]]'' wholesaler for co-operative stores.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nDuring the 1980s, the CWS began to merge with a number of failing co-operative societies, having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. These mergers with consumers' co-operatives led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members, hence making it both a primary and [[secondary co-operative]].<ref name=\"myners\"/> The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people perceive the British co-operative movement to be one business, The Co-operative Group, or co-op for short.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===Modernisation and takeover attempts (1990\u20131999)===\nBy the start of the 1990s, the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was in question. This was at a time when many [[building society|building societies]] were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short-term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead.\n\nThe Co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the [[Co-operative Retail Services|CRS]] and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society.\n\nTogether these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if the Co-op was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful Co-operative Bank), the CWS sold many of its factories to [[Andrew Regan]] in 1994 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]111 million in what initially appeared to be a highly beneficial arrangement for the CWS.\n\nHowever, later it appeared that those involved in this deal did so without the CWS Board's permission and had been also handing confidential CWS files to Regan. Notably, one Sunday newspaper printed the CWS' annual report before it had been officially released. This would later pose a huge threat to the CWS when in 1997 Regan posed a highly ambitious \u00a31.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-rejects-regans-advance-1271324.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Co-op rejects Regan's advance | author=Nigel Cope\n|date=6 March 1997 }}</ref> This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previous opposed.\n\nThe CWS, under the leadership of Graham Melmoth, was able to defend itself from this takeover bid, largely by informing Regan's creditors that his hostile takeover was based upon dubiously sourced data and bad business practices. The deal also failed because Regan had greatly misunderstood the CWS' complicated ownership structure, assuming that by paying off the 500,000 'active members' he could gain control of the CWS.\n\nThough this strategy worked for the [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbaggers]] working to demutualise UK building societies at the time, it failed to recognise that the ownership actually lay with millions of ordinary members and that many of these 'active members' were staunch co-operators and who would be unlikely to back the bid.\n\nAfter investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34792/news/consumer/regan039s-out-court-settlement-co-op-group/|title=Regan's out-of-court settlement with Co-op Group|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe shock that Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the reduced hostilities between the CWS and CRS factions which eventually ended with the CRS becoming a member of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group|CRTG]] before fully merging with the CWS in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/670302.stm |title=Co-op merger approved |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2000 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 [[Co-operative Commission]] report, chaired by [[John Monks]], which proposed a strategy of modernisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.coop/newsroom/ten-years-co-operative-commission|title=Blog: Ten Years from the Co-operative Commission \u2013 Co-operatives UK Newsroom|work=uk.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe report focused on improving store design and building a consistent [[The Co-operative brand|branding]] whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive \u2013 the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage'; a favourite idea of Graham Melmoth, which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the Co-op which would further its commercial success \u2013 a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to \"The Co-operative brand\" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-date=31 October 2007|website=Co-operatives UK|date=13 June 2005|title=Commission Paves the Way for Co-operative Success}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the CWS-CRS merger, new governance arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however, was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a [[secondary co-operative]] led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a governance arrangement which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit governance arrangement.<ref name=myners /> In 2014 the governance arrangements were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review \u2013 for more information see the [[The Co-operative Group#Governance|governance section]].\n\n====Establishing the \"Co-operative difference\"====\nThough the modernisation of the business was most noticeable after the 1997 takeover attempt, this is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from \"selling to\" to \"buying for\" co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the Co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before the Second World War. Many leaders within the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example, expanding into [[hypermarkets]] after [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] had already developed a dominant position, but without the resources to compete on price. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its [[hypermarkets]] and [[department stores]] and instead focus on its core chain of [[convenience store]]s.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nAs a further attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of [[Apartheid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/40332/news/social-enterprise/my-story-how-co-operators-led-south-african-boycott-support-mandela/|title=My story: How co-operators led a South African boycott in support of Mandela|author=Elaine Dean|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=12 December 2013}}</ref>), by cementing its \"ethical\" credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the \"co-operative difference\".\n\nThis move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. As a part of this, the Co-op worked with [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] to help introduce the [[Fairtrade Mark]] in the UK. It was an early adopter of the [[RSPCA]]'s 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification. It introduced the first supermarket range of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by [[Cruelty Free International]] as \"not tested on animals\".\n\nThis new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS' changes. The Co-op had been pioneering on notable changes to its packaging with nutritional labelling on food (1985) and later introduced [[Braille]] on its packaging. Many [[own brand]] products were also reformulated to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in order to make the product range more healthy. So successful was this initiative that competitors such as Sainsbury's and [[Marks and Spencer]] began to follow aggressively on these initiatives.\n[[File:Co-op shop - geograph.org.uk - 593466.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Co-Op Welcome' branding from [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]]]\n\n[[File:Co-op Store at Warwickgates - geograph.org.uk - 1098934.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Late Shop' branding on the co-op store in [[Whitnash]]]]\nIn an attempt to build upon the success which was being felt around the increasing public perception of the co-op as an ethical retailer and to implement what was a core recommendation of the 2001 Co-operatives Commission, The Co-operative Group launched a brand panel which was tasked with developing a single consistent national branding standard for the movement. For decades, marketing by co-operatives was confusing for many customers with different societies adopting different store names (notably \"Co-op Welcome\" and \"Co-op Late Shop\"), various shop fascia designs and inconsistent marketing. Also, the cloverleaf design of the Co-op logo was seen by many as too associated with the years of neglect and decline within the movement and hence The Co-operative Group aimed to launch a totally new brand.\n\nThe new \"[[The Co-operative brand|The Co-operative]]\" branding was first displayed at the 2005 co-operative congress and became the first brand which could bring together all of the co-operative businesses (both those of The Group and the independent societies) under a single consistent brand. With the brand came a set of standards which any outlet using the brand must adhere to \u2013 to maintain a high standard of impression with customers. A twelve-month pilot of the new branding followed and these suggested that a significant growth in sales followed the re-branding of stores, largely understood to result from a major impact on public perceptions. Not all of the independent societies joined this new branding however, with [[United Co-operatives]] (prior to its merger with the Co-operative Group), the [[Scottish Midland Co-operative Society]] and the [[Lincolnshire Co-operative Society]] not adopting the new brand design. In combination with the new \"The Co-operative\" redesign, the Co-op sought to relaunch the co-operative membership scheme using a single consistent national standard and featuring the re-introduction of the member dividend.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nTogether, this renewed focus on responsible trading, the redesign of \"The Co-operative\" brand and the reintroduction of the member dividend helped to build the start of a renewed relationship with the British public. In 2006 a survey found the Co-op to be the most trusted major retailer in the UK and almost six million people joined the membership scheme over the following five years. Even after The Co-operative Group's financial crisis of 2013 the 'Have Your Say' survey found that more than 70% of the public agreed that the Co-op 'tries to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion (2000\u20132012)===\n[[File:VG Grocers Logo FAIR USE ONLY.jpg|thumb|180px|The VG logo and shop livery, c. 1990]]\nFollowing the integration of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Co-op-comes-to-the-rescue-of-Alldays|title=Co-op comes to the rescue of Alldays|work=FoodAndDrinkEurope.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a [[Business franchise|franchise]] operation, supplying marketing and own-brand products to independently owned grocers. The Co-op invested significantly in distribution facilities, notably by opening a purpose built National Distribution Centre in [[Coventry]] during 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/category-news/supermarket/co-op-opens-new-ndc/|title=Co-op opens new NDC|work=Talking Retail|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their steady expansion after 2000 the [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Pharmacy]] and [[The Co-operative Funeralcare|Funeralcare]] businesses were performing well, however the farming business was poorly aligned with the needs of the food stores and so was significantly reorganised in 2007 to focus the farmland on producing produce for the business' food stores. The co-op also moved into new business opportunities during this period adding a [[The Co-operative Legal Services|legal services business]] (providing [[conveyancing]], [[Will and testament|will]] writing and [[probate]] services) and an Energy Generation business, the latter included significant investment in renewable energy generation which formed another key aspect of the co-op's drive towards its ethical image. This period was successful for the co-op in increasing its profitability and in beginning to rationalise what had been a sprawling but rather unsuccessful conglomerate. Many however, believed that for the co-op to survive in the long term it would need to merge with other large co-operative societies.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the group began discussions with [[United Co-operatives]], then the UK's second-largest co-operative, about a merger of the societies.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |title=Co-op boards back merger plan |publisher=Boards of the Co-operative Group and [[United Co-operatives]] |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219093136/http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |archivedate=19 February 2007 }}</ref> Such a merger was expected to lead to significant efficiency savings owing to the large duplication of services which the two societies provided.

This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members at all levels of the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions(Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourhoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: Quite a task for volunteer laypeople.\n\nThe Group Board was made up of fifteen \"lay\" member directors elected from regional boards, another five which came from the \"independent societies\" and, though there was the option to appoint up to three \"independent professional non-executive directors\" (IPNEDs) to the Group Board at any one time, only one was ever appointed.\n\nAll Group Board members (excluding IPNEDs) were appointed by competitive regional election \u2013 in contrast, most building societies and [[public limited company|PLCs]] have a nominations committee consisting of members of the executive which picks potential board members and puts them up for uncontested elections.\n\nA series of regional boards, consisting of twelve to fifteen people elected from area committees, were responsible for holding the Group Board to account and for block-voting at the Annual General Meeting. There were 48 area committees which were responsible for representing member interests and promoting membership within their constituency.\n\nOut of the millions of members that the Group had, only area committee members were able to vote in the elections for the regional boards and \"lay\" director seats on the Group Board and the votes were weighted depending on the value of sales within individual areas.\n\nOne of the justifications for this complex governance arrangement was that it took a number of years to reach regional board level, which helped to minimise the influence of single-issue campaigners and [[carpet-bagger]]s. In the 1990s it was these issues, notably the failed take-over by [[Andrew Regan]] in 1997, which caused significant problems for the, then, CRS and CWS.\n\nThe Myners Review noted that \"the primary source of power within the Group [was] firmly entrenched at the level of the Regional Boards\", replicating the roles of the predecessor regional societies in voting a century before, and the review concluded that it was this 'labyrinthine' structure, where Group Board members need to remain elected to Area Committees and regional boards, which led to the governance problems at the Co-op and its financial crisis of 2013.<ref name=myners />\n\n==Dividend and membership scheme==\nThe idea of co-operative trading revolutionised food retailing with the [[dividend]], often known as \"divi\", and the \"divi number\" became a part of British life. The way in which co-operative retail societies are run for the benefit, and on behalf of their members sets them apart from their modern-day competitors. The dividend is a financial reward to members based on each member's level of trade with the society. The distribution of profits on the basis of turnover rather than capital invested is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and most private sector enterprises.\n\n===History of co-op membership===\nHistorically, members' sales would be recorded in ledgers in society's stores and at the end of the collection period a proportional payment would be made to the member. As the societies grew, and the number of members increased, the method of using ledgers became cumbersome. As a solution, some societies, including Co-operative Retail Services, issued stamps to members for qualifying transactions. Members collected stamps on a savings card and, when the card was complete, would use it as payment for goods or deposit into their share account.\n\nBy the late 20th century the group's predecessors and then the Co-operative Group no longer paid true dividend as it had become a drain on limited resources, although several independent societies (such as [[Anglia Regional]]) continued to do so. In the mid-1990s a [[Loyalty program|loyalty card scheme]], in the style of the [[Tesco Clubcard]], was introduced which used the dividend brand.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Grocer]] |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |title=National rollout for CWS reward card |quote=The card which has been on trial since May 1996 is unique in that it awards cash payments rather than credit points. |date=25 October 1997 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |author=Christian Cull |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720184541/http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> These loyalty cards were inspired by the co-operative dividend but were little more than marketing exercises and a way to gather useful customer information. Co-operative customers, not just members, could sign up and receive a swipe card to record purchases with vouchers sent out twice a year which could be exchanged for cash or goods.\n\nIn September 2006 the Co-operative Group relaunched \"true\" dividend whereby a proportion of the profits of the Co-operative Group is returned to members. To emphasise the change, the scheme is now called the ''Co-operative Membership'' and members earn a \"share of the profits\".

Since then, other independent co-operatives have joined the reciprocal membership dividend scheme, including [[Central England Co-operative]] (merged from [[Anglia Regional Co-operative Society|Anglia]] and [[Midlands Co-operative|Midlands]] who joined in 2008 and 2010 respectively), [[Southern Co-operative]] (2009) and [[Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society]] (2009). This reciprocal membership agreement means members of these societies can earn membership points at more than 90% of UK co-operative outlets.\n\n===Current membership scheme===\nThe current co-op membership scheme was launched in September 2016 and rewards members with 5% of what they spend on own brand products and services being credited back to their membership account. A further 1% is donated to a local charitable or community cause which the members helps to select. Additionally, members will still earn their share of the profits when the member dividend returns (expected 2018). Though the independent societies are not participating in the 5+1% scheme, members can earn the points (from which the profit share is derived) at five of the largest consumer's co-operatives within the UK owing to a reciprocal membership scheme (described above).\n\n==Ethical trading and campaigning==\nAs the UK's largest co-operative, the group plays a key part in the co-operative movement. In the 1840s the original co-op shops were set up to protect consumers from adulterated food and profiteering shopkeepers. Since then the co-operative movement has campaigned on a number of issues which they thought were key consumer interests. As a part of this, The Co-operative Group has long been campaigning for consumer rights legislation, researching into new food labelling initiatives, a major sponsor of new co-operative ventures, a notable donor to community initiatives, directly involved in the development of animal welfare standards and in championing [[Fairtrade]] in the UK.\n\nThe Co-op has traded on its 'ethical' credentials for many years and in 2014 a survey suggested that 70% of the British public believed that it was a business that 'tried to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haveyoursay.coop|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The co-op is particularly known for its work in championing the introduction of Fairtrade in the UK, investing in renewable energy and in reducing its carbon emissions, in maintaining high standards of animal welfare, in being a leading retailer of responsible fish, for reinvesting its profits in local communities and for campaigning on a range of social issues.\n\nThe Co-operative is widely recognised for its commitment to responsible and ethical trading, particularly for championing [[fairtrade]] in the UK.<ref name=\"fairtrade.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/buying-fairtrade/tea/cooperative|title=The Co-operative|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> These commitments and its mutual structure led to The Co-operative Food being awarded ''[[Ethical Consumer]]'' magazine's 'Best Buy' status in 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/food/supermarkets.aspx|title=The most ethical supermarkets.

The business has also constructed its own renewable energy generation facilities, operating three [[wind farms]] with a fourth given [[planning permission]] in 2014.

The Co-op implemented this labelling system on own-brand products the same year. Further research in 1993 suggested that many consumers were confused by the nutritional labelling schemes used at the time. Both of these findings were supported by evidence gathered by the [[Food Standards Agency]] in 2002 and the Institute for Grocery Distribution proposed a new labelling system based upon the [[guideline daily amount]] principle.\n\nAs a consequence of this research, the Co-op trialled a new greatly extended labelling format which went above the legal requirement for what should be included at the time (energy, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, fat, of which saturates, [[fibre]] and sodium) by including reference values for \"guideline daily amounts\", displaying whether each item constitutes \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\", providing information regarding recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables, using the word \"calories\" rather than \"energy\" and for displaying \"[[salt]]\" rather than \"[[sodium]]\". Overall this new design was endorsed by 89% of those customers asked. As a part of this change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all own-brand products which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word \"salt\" over \"sodium\" was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand the difference between the two words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.<ref name=Corporate>{{cite report |url=https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |title=Lie of the Label II |accessdate=2015-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103411/https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-op}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 The Co-operative Group published further research which they had conducted into front-of-pack labelling schemes and have modified their own front-of-pack labelling scheme to combine both the traffic light and guideline daily amount schemes into one simple system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/co-operative-food-research-champions-traffic-lights-and-new-front-of-pack-labelling/|title=Co-operative Food research champions traffic lights and front-of-pack labelling|work=Retail Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009 the Co-op also introduced a 'green dot' scheme where additional specifically defined nutritional benefits in products (e.g. over 6&nbsp;g of fibre per 100 g) were included on the front of the pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/magazine/foodanddrink/healthy-eating/green-dots-explained/|title=green dots explained \u2013 traffic light labelling for a healthier diet|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Since 2003, the Co-op has been using a similar system to highlight products which count towards one's '5 a day' fruit and veg \u2013 also listing the quantity of the product which required to reach the required serving size.\n\nSince 1997 the group has not used \"per-cent fat free\" health claims. The Co-op introduced calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks in 2002 and they also list the caffeine content of products which contain more than 1.6&nbsp;mg in a single serving.\n\nStarting in 1995 the Co-op conducted a survey of the views of over 31,000 customers which suggested that customers wanted to make more informed buying decisions. Consequently, in 1997 the Co-operative Wholesale Society, forerunner to The Co-operative Group, published a report titled \"The Lie of the Label\" which presented a number of techniques which the Co-op accused the food industry of using to mislead the consumer. These included:\n# hiding key information from consumers about a product (e.g. \"products called 'mince' and 'onion', where the main ingredient was mechanically recovered chicken\");\n# using meaningless terms like 'wholesome' or 'natural' to make the product seem better;\n# using unrealistic photographs to make the product seem better on the label than what is achievable with what is actually sold;\n# using claims which make something normal seem special (e.g. dried pasta which is free from preservatives, a legal requirement);\n# framing claims to make a products characteristics seem better (e.g. 80% fat free crisps, when they would have been only 20% fat anyway); and\n# using very small fonts or text colours to make the label difficult to read. Since 1995, the Co-op has clearly labelled the country of origin and percentage content of key ingredients, even when not required to by law.<ref name=Responsible>{{cite report |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Responsible%20Business%20Report.pdf |title=Values in Action |accessdate=2015-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205243/http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Responsible%20Business%20Report.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-operative Group |date=May 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe follow-up report, \"The Lie of the Label II\" (2002), specifically urged legislative improvements to provide consumers with better nutritional information on all foods (especially those foods which disproportionately contribute to consumers' fat, salt and sugar intake) and a new, clearer, more intuitive format for presenting this information to consumers. The report also warned about the prevalence of advertising for sugary, fatty and/or salty foods which are aimed at children and how this will likely impact on the overall public health of young people the UK.<ref name=Corporate/>\n\nThe group has campaigned against many misleading nutritional and 'health' claims which have appeared on food packaging over the years. Those cited included a chocolate spread which is high in both fat and sugar, but which was marketed as \"rich in calcium, magnesium and vitamins\". Other such claims have included products which are advertised as \"low [[cholesterol]]\" when [[saturated fat]] is thought to be a larger control on blood cholesterol than direct cholesterol consumption.<ref name=\"Corporate\"/> The group operates a self-imposed ban on such health claims. In 2003 the European Commission introduced legislation which defined many health claims such as \"fat free\" and \"high fibre\" to reduce the prevalence of meaningless claims on food packaging, a move welcomed by the co-op movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34328/news/business/co-ops-back-labelling-crackdown/|title=Co-ops back labelling crackdown|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 the group became the first retailer to include Braille writing on its range of medicines and alcoholic drinks, a move which received three industry awards.<ref name=Responsible/> In 2015 Braille can also be found on many products, including breakfast cereals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/2001present/|title=2001 \u2013 present day|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128043902/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/2001present/|archivedate=28 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/216426/co-op-extend-braille-labelling-food-range|title=Co-op to extend braille labelling to food range|work=marketingmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Co-operative Group became the first retailer to list the ingredients in its own-brand wines on the label in 1999 in a move that was illegal at the time.
