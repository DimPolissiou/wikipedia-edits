There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local [[pub]]. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent, and some are no longer present.\n\nThe stone circles have been studied since [[John Aubrey]]'s visit in 1664, and some excavations of the site were performed in the 18th century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]] have confirmed the size of the stone circles and identified additional pits and [[posthole]]s. The Cove has been shown to be around 1000 years older than the stone circles, and so date from 4000-3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.\n\n== Monument ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = John Aubrey.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Stukeley William.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The antiquarians [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]] both visited the stone circles at Stanton Drew\n}}\n\nThe most famous feature is the Great Circle, the second largest [[stone circle]] in Britain (after [[Avebury Henge|Avebury]]).

When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet.

(Enter iron gate on L. a few hundred yards before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous \"druidical remains\" will be found near the church. About 50&nbsp;yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The \"remains\" consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (whatever that may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur's victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance. The penalty for a \"Sabbath\" thus \"profaned\" was the prompt transformation of the bridal party into stone. Hence the local appellation of \"The fiddlers and the maids\".<ref>{{gutenberg|no=12287|name=Somerset by Wade, G.W. & Wade, J.H.}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Wide image|Stanton Drew North East Circle

The largest [[stone circle]] is the Great Circle, {{convert|113|m}} in diameter and the second largest stone circle in Britain (after [[Avebury]]); it is considered to be one of the largest [[Neolithic]] monuments to have been built. The date of construction is not known, but is thought to be between 3000 and 2000 [[BCE]], which places it in the Late Neolithic\nto Early [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oswin |first1=John |last2=Richards |first2=John |last3=Sermon |first3=Richard |title=Stanton Drew 2010 Geophysical survey and other  archaeological investigations |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/sd_2010_report_low_res.pdf |publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council |accessdate=21 August 2014 |format=PDF |page=63 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921170254/http://bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/sd_2010_report_low_res.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}</ref> It was made a [[scheduled monument]] in 1982.<ref name=nhlecircles/>\n\nThe Great Circle was surrounded by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the northeast and southwest. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local [[pub]]. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent, and some are no longer present.\n\nThe stone circles have been studied since [[John Aubrey]]'s visit in 1664, and some excavations of the site were performed in the 18th century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]] have confirmed the size of the stone circles and identified additional pits and [[posthole]]s. The Cove has been shown to be around 1000 years older than the stone circles, and so date from 4000-3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.\n\n== Monument ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = John Aubrey.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Stukeley William.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The antiquarians [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]] both visited the stone circles at Stanton Drew\n}}\n\nThe most famous feature is the Great Circle, the second largest [[stone circle]] in Britain (after [[Avebury Henge|Avebury]]).

The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet.

(Enter iron gate on L. a few hundred yards before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous \"druidical remains\" will be found near the church. About 50&nbsp;yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The \"remains\" consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (whatever that may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur's victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance. The penalty for a \"Sabbath\" thus \"profaned\" was the prompt transformation of the bridal party into stone. Hence the local appellation of \"The fiddlers and the maids\".<ref>{{gutenberg|no=12287|name=Somerset by Wade, G.W. & Wade, J.H.}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Wide image|Stanton Drew North East Circle
