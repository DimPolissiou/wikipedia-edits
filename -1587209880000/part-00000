Most of the time, the lamina in F.limbatus is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally. \n\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:<br />\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf.

The cells are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical or distal to the vaginant laminae, on the adaxial side of the [[costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina: the part of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing base and the ventral lamina, occupying the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa.

Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium sometimes enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina),\u00a0 which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]].  The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before apex.

{"title_page": "1911 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1911 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the second full organised club season in Auckland following the [[1910 Auckland Rugby League season]]. It featured a representative program in August and September where [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] went undefeated. The season commenced on 20 May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup.\n\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]], Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', [[Auckland Domain]], and [[Eden Park]] (which was the venue for the club final between [[City Rovers]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]].\n\n==Eden Ramblers Formed==\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard, MP]] presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on 29 April with a join practice with Ponsonby at Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Eden Ramblers

It featured a representative program in August and September where [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] went undefeated. The season commenced on 20 May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup.\n\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]], Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', [[Auckland Domain]], and [[Eden Park]] (which was the venue for the club final between [[City Rovers]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]].\n\n==Eden Ramblers Formed==\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard, MP]] presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on 29 April with a join practice with Ponsonby at Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Eden Ramblers
