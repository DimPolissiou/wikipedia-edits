Since its first show in 1948, Farnborough has seen the debut of many famous planes, including the [[Vickers VC10]], [[Concorde]], the [[Eurofighter]], the Airbus [[A380]], and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]]. At the 1958 show, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]\u2019s [[Black Arrows]] executed a 22-plane formation loop, setting a world record.\n\nThe international trade show is put together every two years by FIL Farnborough International Ltd. and takes over the entire course of a week.

TDI was first incorporated in 1938. TDI was sold to IT&T in the early 1970s and then to the Winston Network in the early 1980s, it was later renamed TDI in 1989 led by Bill Apfelbaum. In 1996 the company was sold to [[Infinity Broadcasting]]. The transit business and the billboard business merged in 2001 under the name '''Viacom Outdoor'''.\n\nThe billboard division was originally two separate companies: 3M National, the outdoor advertising subsidiary of [[3M]]; and Gannett Outdoor, owned by the [[Gannett Company]]. In August 1996, Gannett exited the billboard business by [[corporate spin-off|spinning off]] Gannett Outdoor into a new company, Outdoor Systems. This new company would later acquire 3M National in May 1997, but before that sale was finalized, the [[United States Justice Department]] ruled that Outdoor Systems had to sell nearly all of its 3M billboards in ten U.S. cities (all 3M billboards in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Denver]]; [[Detroit]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]; plus almost all 3M billboards in [[Atlanta]] and half of 3M's billboards in [[Houston]]) where both Outdoor Systems and 3M National already had billboards to [[Lamar Advertising]] to avoid a monopoly in these cities.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1997/1202.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1999 Outdoor Systems (OSI) was bought by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity]] and became Infinity Outdoor.

When [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] split from [[CBS Corporation]] in December 2005, it became CBS Outdoor. CBS owned CBS Outdoor as a division of CBS until March 2014, at which point it was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] into an independent company.

TDI was first incorporated in 1938. TDI was sold to IT&T in the early 1970s and then to the Winston Network in the early 1980s, it was later renamed TDI in 1989 led by Bill Apfelbaum. In 1996 the company was sold to [[Infinity Broadcasting]]. The transit business and the billboard business merged in 2001 under the name '''Viacom Outdoor'''.\n\nThe billboard division was originally two separate companies: 3M National, the outdoor advertising subsidiary of [[3M]]; and Gannett Outdoor, owned by the [[Gannett Company]]. In August 1996, Gannett exited the billboard business by [[corporate spin-off|spinning off]] Gannett Outdoor into a new company, Outdoor Systems. This new company would later acquire 3M National in May 1997, but before that sale was finalized, the [[United States Justice Department]] ruled that Outdoor Systems had to sell nearly all of its 3M billboards in ten U.S. cities (all 3M billboards in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Denver]]; [[Detroit]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]; plus almost all 3M billboards in [[Atlanta]] and half of 3M's billboards in [[Houston]]) where both Outdoor Systems and 3M National already had billboards to [[Lamar Advertising]] to avoid a monopoly in these cities.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1997/1202.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1999 Outdoor Systems (OSI) was bought by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity]] and became Infinity Outdoor. Infinity was absorbed into [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] in 2001, and became Viacom Outdoor. When [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] split from [[CBS Corporation]] in December 2005, it became CBS Outdoor. CBS owned CBS Outdoor as a division of CBS until March 2014, at which point it was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] into an independent company. CBS Corporation continued to own 83% of Outfront Media, although this number is expected to decline over time as Outfront Media converts into a [[real estate investment trust]] and CBS Corporation divests itself of the outdoor unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/01/cbs-outdoor-not-ready-to-have-name-on-the-big-boar.aspx |title=CBS Outdoor Not Ready to Have Name on the Big Board &#124; The Motley Fool |publisher=Fool.com |date=2014-04-01 |accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> CBS Outdoor shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on March 28, 2014.<ref name=\"DealBook: CBS shares rise on debut\">{{cite web | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/shares-of-cbs-outdoor-rise-on-debut/ | title=Shares of CBS Outdoor Rise on Debut | publisher=NY Times DealBook | date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that CBS Outdoor would acquire the billboard business of Van Wagner Communications for $690 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/21/us-cbs-outdoor-assets-idUSKBN0FQ0XK20140721 | title=CBS Outdoor buys Van Wagner billboard unit for $690 million | author=Liana Baker | publisher=Reuters | date=21 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of July 17, 2014 CBS Outdoor became a fully independent corporation, operating as a real estate investment trust.

OMNOVA was founded in 1999 when [[GenCorp]] spun off its Decorative & Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses into a separate, publicly traded company. OMNOVA's world headquarters is located in [[Beachwood, Ohio]]  with additional sales, manufacturing and distribution locations through Europe and Asia.\n\n==Products==\nOMNOVA produces a variety of products within two Business Units - Performance Chemicals and Engineered Surfaces. The Engineered Surfaces business the following divisions: Performance [[Chemicals]], Pool Liner Films, Performance Films, [[Laminate]]s, viewnique Digital Murals and [[Upholstery]].\n\n===Performance Chemicals===\nAccording to OMNOVA's webpage, the Performance Chemicals business makes up about 75% of the Company's revenues.  Emulsion polymers and specialty chemicals are key ingredients in products for a wide variety of end uses including architectural and industrial coatings; nonwovens used in hygiene products, filtration and construction; drilling additives for oil and gas exploration and production; elastomeric modification of plastic casings and hoses used in household and industrial products and automobiles; floor polishes and sealers; tire cord and other fabric reinforced rubber goods; molded rubber components; tapes and adhesives; sports surfaces; textile finishes; carpet backing; [[coated paper]] and packaging; and the list goes on.\n\nThe performance features of end use products that incorporate OMNOVA chemicals include stain, rust and aging resistance; surface modification; gloss; softness or hardness; dimensional stability; high heat and pressure tolerance; binding and barrier (e.g. moisture, oil) properties, and others.\n\n===Engineered Surfaces===\nOMNOVA's Engineered Surfaces business comprises the remaining 25% of the company's sales. Laminates, coated fabrics and films are primarily rolled goods (and occasionally sheets) of vinyl, polyurethane or paper. Superior durability, cleanability, stain and chip resistance, and design flexibility are hallmarks of these products. Additionally, the Engineered Surfaces Business Unit's products include viewnique digital wall murals which can be used to create branded interior for restaurants and retail chains. \n\n===Laminates===\nOMNOVA's laminate portfolio includes realistic woodgrains, faux marbles and granites, contemporary patterns and solids, available in a variety of textures, colors, and surface decorative and protective finishes in a range of constructions from cost-effective Paper Laminates to high-performance 3D (thermofoil) Laminates. OMNOVA's laminates are used to fabricate retail fixtures and displays, casework for hospitality and food service; kitchen and bath cabinetry; residential and commercial furniture; recreational vehicle and manufactured housing interiors; and luxury vinyl tile flooring. \n\n===Upholstery===\nOMNOVA's coated fabrics are primarily used in upholstered seating as a high performance alternative to textile upholsteries, which are costly and difficult to clean. Major and emerging automotive OEMs in Asia are increasingly depending on OMNOVA\u2019s coated fabrics to upgrade the quality of their seating. Additionally, OMNOVA's vinyl and polyurethane upholstery is used across the global transportation sector in mass transit trains and buses, heavy duty trucks and boats. OMNOVA's upholstery products are also used in various contract applications including healthcare, casinos, hospitality and corporate office.\n\n===Acquisition by Synthomer===\nOn July 2, 2019, [[Synthomer]] announced that it's gonna buy Omnova Solutions for an enterprise value of $824 million in a bid to strengthen it's global position as heard from [[Reuters]]. The deal was completed on January 15, 2020. So this means that Synthomer will still acquire Omnova Solutions later in the year.\n\n==Credit Ratings==\nS&P Global Ratings April 2, 2020 OMNOVA Solutions Inc.

Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position.

Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been [[Biomedical Reference Laboratories]], which dated from the late 1960s, and was  located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc.], FundingUniverse.com</ref>\n\nBy 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. [[James Powell (biologist)|James Powell]] was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina.

At the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1776, the Wataugans organized the \"Washington District,\" which was governed by a [[committee of safety (American Revolution)|committee of safety]].  North Carolina initially refused to recognize the settlements as legal, but finally agreed to annex the district after the settlers thwarted an invasion by hostile Cherokees.  The settlements were governed as the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]], which originally included all of what is now Tennessee.  The district was reorganized as Washington County in 1777.<ref name=tehc>Mildred Kozsuch and Ruth Broyles, \"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1472 Washington County],\" ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''.

The county reverted to North Carolina control, however, following the failure of the Franklin state government in 1788.\n\n===Part of Tennessee===\nIn 1790 the area became part of [[Southwest Territory]], and afterward it was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state.<ref name=tehc />  [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesboro]], the county seat of Washington County, is Tennessee's oldest town.

Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and a lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects discussion in class are sometimes very intens and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usual offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level.

Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects discussion in class are sometimes very intens and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usual offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium_Jena"}

[[Ramree Island]] ([[Yangbye]] Kywan) lies off the [[Burma]] coast, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of Akyab (now [[Sittwe]]). The island had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in early 1942, along with the rest of Southern Burma. In January 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] launched an attack to retake Ramree and its neighbour [[Cheduba|Cheduba Island]], to establish airbases on the islands for the supply of the mainland campaign. There have been reports of Japanese soldiers being eaten by [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in the inland [[mangrove swamps]]; the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] has listed it as \"worst crocodile disaster in the world\" and \"most number of fatalities in a [[crocodile attack]]\" but scientists and historians have dismissed this as implausible.{{sfn|Russell|1987|p=216}}{{sfn|Kynaston|1998|p=135}}\n\n==Background==\nThe early capture of [[Sittwe|Akyab]] made the [[26th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Henry Chambers (Indian Army officer)|Henry Chambers]]) available for an attack on Ramree Island, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the south, the island being {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide, flat and an obvious site for airfields.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} A plan was ready by 2 January, when it was clear that the advance of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) would soon pass beyond the range of its airbases at [[Imphal]] and [[Agartala]]; replacements at [[Chittagong]], Akyab and Ramree would be needed.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=433}} On 14 January, the 26th Indian Division was ordered to attack Ramree on 21 January, as a Royal Marine detachment from [[3 Commando Brigade]] occupied Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=214\u2013215}} The Japanese garrison of Ramree consisted of the II Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment (Colonel Kanichi Nagazawa), part of the [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]], with artillery and engineer detachments to act as an independent force.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=215}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\nThe battle started with [[Operation Matador (1945)|Operation Matador]], an amphibious assault to capture the strategic port of [[Kyaukpyu]] at the north end of Ramree Island and the airfield near the port, south of [[Akyab]] across Hunter's Bay. The invasion force was led by three Joint Assault Commanders, Captain Bush RN, Major-General [[Cyril Lomax]] and Wing Commander H. Smith. Reconnaissance carried out on 14 January 1945, found that Japanese forces were placing artillery in caves overlooking the landing beaches on Ramree and the [[Royal Navy]] assigned the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, the [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] {{HMS|Ameer|D01|6}}, [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}, the destroyers ''Rapid'', ''Napier'', ''Norman'' and ''Pathfinder'', with the [[Black Swan-class sloop|sloops]] ''Flamingo'' and {{HMIS|Kistna|U46|6}}.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\nThe large number of ships was intended to provide more firepower in support of the landing force. On 21 January, an hour before the [[71st Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier R. C. Cotterell-Hill) was to land, ''Queen Elizabeth'' opened fire with {{nowrap|69 rounds}} of {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}}-shell from the main battery, the fall of shot being watched by aircraft from ''Ameer''. ''Phoebe'' also joined the bombardment, along with Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]]s, North American [[B-25 Mitchell]]s and Republic [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of [[No. 224 Group RAF|224 Group]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), under the command of [[RAF Third Tactical Air Force|HQ RAF Bengal and Burma]], that strafed and bombed the beaches.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Indian Div beside temple on Ramree Island.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Men of the Wiltshire Regiment from the 26th Indian Infantry Division prepare a meal beside a temple on Ramree Island.}}]]\nThe assault troops were slightly delayed when a motor launch and a landing craft struck mines but landed unopposed on the beaches west of Kyaukpyu at {{nowrap|9:42 a.m.,}} securing the beachhead by the afternoon. The following day, the [[4th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier J. F. R. Forman) landed, took over the beachhead and occupied Kyaukpyu and on 23 January, the 71st Infantry Brigade advanced southwards, down the west coast. Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day. Resistance at the chaung from the troops of the II Battalion, 121st Regiment increased and on 31 January, the 71st Brigade was ordered to move inland, north-east towards Sane, then head south towards Ramree town. The 4th Brigade was to keep the defenders at Yanbauk Chaung under pressure and follow up vigorously should they retire.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n(On 26 January in [[Operation Sankey]], a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] force landed on [[Cheduba]] island, about {{convert|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the south-west coast of Ramree Island and found it unoccupied.) On Ramree, the Japanese garrison put up tenacious resistance but on 1 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade reached Sane and parts of the [[36th Indian Infantry Brigade]], from reserve, took Sagu Kuyun Island and relieved the marines on Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}} When the British outflanked a Japanese stronghold, the {{nowrap|900 defenders}} abandoned the base and marched to join a larger battalion of Japanese soldiers across the island. The route took the Japanese through {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[mangrove]] swamp and as they struggled through it, the British encircled the area. Trapped in deep mud-filled land, tropical diseases soon started to afflict the soldiers, as did [[scorpion]]s, tropical [[mosquito]]es and [[saltwater crocodile]]s.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\nOn 7 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade and supporting tanks reached the town of Ramree and found determined Japanese resistance. The 4th Indian Infantry Brigade had advanced to Ledaung Chaung and was sent east to reinforce the attack; the town fell on 9 February. The navy and the 26th Indian Infantry Division then concentrated on blockading the ''chaungs'' (small streams) on the east coast to prevent the Japanese from escaping to the mainland. A Japanese air raid on 11 February seriously damaged a destroyer with a near miss and forty small craft were sent by the Japanese from the mainland to rescue the survivors of the garrison. Japanese resistance on the island ended on 17 February and the Allied blockade was maintained until 22 February, sinking many of the rescue craft and inflicting many casualties on the Japanese troops hiding in the mangrove swamps; about {{nowrap|500 troops}} managed to get away. Cheduba Island was not garrisoned and the 22nd East African Brigade was sent to hold Ramree Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn 1965, the British official historian [[Stanley Kirby|Stanley Woodburn Kirby]] wrote that the Japanese defence of the island and the escape of about {{nowrap|500 men}} against \"fearful odds\", had been courageous and determined.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}} It took until 16 April for the airfield to be used for transport sorties, Akyab having come into use on 1 April. It had been vital to complete the occupation of Ramree Island quickly, as [[Operation Dracula]] against Rangoon needed to commence in the first week of May at the latest, to have a chance of finishing before the monsoon.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} The experience in co-operation between the 26th Indian Division and the navy in the war of chaungs and small ports along the Arakan coast was intended to be exploited in the attack. An estimate put naval gunfire support from 4 January to 13 March for the land operations at Akyab, Ramree and Cheduba at {{nowrap|23,000 shells.}} The navy also carried {{nowrap|54,000 men,}} {{nowrap|1,000 vehicles,}} {{convert|14000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of stores and {{nowrap|800 animals.}}{{sfn|Allen|1984|p=468}}\n\n===Crocodile attack===\n[[File:SaltwaterCrocodile('Maximo').jpg|thumb|{{centre|A [[saltwater crocodile]]}}]]\nSome British soldiers, including the naturalist [[Bruce Stanley Wright|Bruce Wright]], who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island [[predation|preyed on]] the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers. Wright gave a description in ''Wildlife Sketches Near and Far'' (1962), quoted by [[Frank McLynn]],\n\n{{quote|That night [of the 19 February 1945] was the most horrible that any member of the M. L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left.... Of about one thousand Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were found alive.|Wright{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=13}}}}\n\nIf Wright was correct, the Ramree Island [[crocodile attacks]] were the worst recorded in history. The British [[Burma Star Association]] seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the {{nowrap|20 Japanese}} survivors of one attack and the {{nowrap|900 Japanese}} who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp. In his memoir, ''An Odyssey in War and Peace'', Lieutenant-General [[J.F.R. Jacob]] recounted his experiences during the battle,\n\n{{quote|Over a 1000 soldiers of the Japanese garrison retreated into the crocodile-infested mangrove swamps. We went in with boats and interpreters using loud-hailers asking them to come out. Not a single one did. salt-water crocodiles, some of them well over 20 ft in length frequented these waters. It is not difficult to imagine what happened to the Japanese who took refuge in the mangroves!{{sfn|Jacob|2012|loc=Ch 2}}}}\n\nThese figures have been disputed by other historians, who call the event an [[urban myth]].{{sfn|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001|pp=15\u201318}} McLynn wrote\n\n{{quote|Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with an exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=14}}}}\n\nThe British official history (War against Japan volume IV, ''The Reconquest of Burma'', 1965 [2004]) referred only to \"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\".{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|1984}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War |publisher=Dent Paperbacks |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-460-02474-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jacob |first=J.

The following day, the [[4th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier J. F. R. Forman) landed, took over the beachhead and occupied Kyaukpyu and on 23 January, the 71st Infantry Brigade advanced southwards, down the west coast. Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day. Resistance at the chaung from the troops of the II Battalion, 121st Regiment increased and on 31 January, the 71st Brigade was ordered to move inland, north-east towards Sane, then head south towards Ramree town. The 4th Brigade was to keep the defenders at Yanbauk Chaung under pressure and follow up vigorously should they retire.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n(On 26 January in [[Operation Sankey]], a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] force landed on [[Cheduba]] island, about {{convert|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the south-west coast of Ramree Island and found it unoccupied.) On Ramree, the Japanese garrison put up tenacious resistance but on 1 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade reached Sane and parts of the [[36th Indian Infantry Brigade]], from reserve, took Sagu Kuyun Island and relieved the marines on Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}} When the British outflanked a Japanese stronghold, the {{nowrap|900 defenders}} abandoned the base and marched to join a larger battalion of Japanese soldiers across the island. The route took the Japanese through {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[mangrove]] swamp and as they struggled through it, the British encircled the area. Trapped in deep mud-filled land, tropical diseases soon started to afflict the soldiers, as did [[scorpion]]s, tropical [[mosquito]]es and [[saltwater crocodile]]s.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\nOn 7 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade and supporting tanks reached the town of Ramree and found determined Japanese resistance. The 4th Indian Infantry Brigade had advanced to Ledaung Chaung and was sent east to reinforce the attack; the town fell on 9 February. The navy and the 26th Indian Infantry Division then concentrated on blockading the ''chaungs'' (small streams) on the east coast to prevent the Japanese from escaping to the mainland. A Japanese air raid on 11 February seriously damaged a destroyer with a near miss and forty small craft were sent by the Japanese from the mainland to rescue the survivors of the garrison. Japanese resistance on the island ended on 17 February and the Allied blockade was maintained until 22 February, sinking many of the rescue craft and inflicting many casualties on the Japanese troops hiding in the mangrove swamps; about {{nowrap|500 troops}} managed to get away. Cheduba Island was not garrisoned and the 22nd East African Brigade was sent to hold Ramree Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn 1965, the British official historian [[Stanley Kirby|Stanley Woodburn Kirby]] wrote that the Japanese defence of the island and the escape of about {{nowrap|500 men}} against \"fearful odds\", had been courageous and determined.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}} It took until 16 April for the airfield to be used for transport sorties, Akyab having come into use on 1 April. It had been vital to complete the occupation of Ramree Island quickly, as [[Operation Dracula]] against Rangoon needed to commence in the first week of May at the latest, to have a chance of finishing before the monsoon.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} The experience in co-operation between the 26th Indian Division and the navy in the war of chaungs and small ports along the Arakan coast was intended to be exploited in the attack. An estimate put naval gunfire support from 4 January to 13 March for the land operations at Akyab, Ramree and Cheduba at {{nowrap|23,000 shells.}} The navy also carried {{nowrap|54,000 men,}} {{nowrap|1,000 vehicles,}} {{convert|14000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of stores and {{nowrap|800 animals.}}{{sfn|Allen|1984|p=468}}\n\n===Crocodile attack===\n[[File:SaltwaterCrocodile('Maximo').jpg|thumb|{{centre|A [[saltwater crocodile]]}}]]\nSome British soldiers, including the naturalist [[Bruce Stanley Wright|Bruce Wright]], who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island [[predation|preyed on]] the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers. Wright gave a description in ''Wildlife Sketches Near and Far'' (1962), quoted by [[Frank McLynn]],\n\n{{quote|That night [of the 19 February 1945] was the most horrible that any member of the M. L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left.... Of about one thousand Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were found alive.|Wright{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=13}}}}\n\nIf Wright was correct, the Ramree Island [[crocodile attacks]] were the worst recorded in history. The British [[Burma Star Association]] seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the {{nowrap|20 Japanese}} survivors of one attack and the {{nowrap|900 Japanese}} who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp. In his memoir, ''An Odyssey in War and Peace'', Lieutenant-General [[J.F.R. Jacob]] recounted his experiences during the battle,\n\n{{quote|Over a 1000 soldiers of the Japanese garrison retreated into the crocodile-infested mangrove swamps. We went in with boats and interpreters using loud-hailers asking them to come out. Not a single one did. salt-water crocodiles, some of them well over 20 ft in length frequented these waters. It is not difficult to imagine what happened to the Japanese who took refuge in the mangroves!{{sfn|Jacob|2012|loc=Ch 2}}}}\n\nThese figures have been disputed by other historians, who call the event an [[urban myth]].{{sfn|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001|pp=15\u201318}} McLynn wrote\n\n{{quote|Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with an exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=14}}}}\n\nThe British official history (War against Japan volume IV, ''The Reconquest of Burma'', 1965 [2004]) referred only to \"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\".{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|1984}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War |publisher=Dent Paperbacks |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-460-02474-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jacob |first=J.
