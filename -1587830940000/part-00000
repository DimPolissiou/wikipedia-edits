Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts. They marry then and there for the fourth time.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/cast/653/Tina_Lord Tina Lord profile - Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/tina.php Tina Clayton Lord profile - SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://llanviewlabyrinth.webs.com/notoriouslyremembered/1968_1989/remembered_tinalord.html Notoriously Remembered: Tina Lord]\n* [http://soapnet.go.com/soapnet/gallery/path-galleryNum_1667/category_shows/subcategory_daytimeemmysredcarpet2008 \"''OLTL'''s Tina Lord: Through the Years.\" (Photo gallery) - SOAPnet.com]\n\n{{One Life to Live}}\n{{Tina Lord actresses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord, Tina}}\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:One Life to Live characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Tina Lord\n| series         = One Life to Live\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Andrea Evans]] (1978\u20131981, 1985\u20131990, 2008\u20132011)\n* [[Kelli Maroney]] (1984)\n* [[Marsha Clark]] (1984\u20131985)\n* [[Karen Witter]] (1990\u20131994)\n* [[Krista Tesreau]] (1994\u20131997)\n}}\n| first          = {{start date|1978|07|2}}\n| last           = {{end date|2011|11|15}}\n| years          = {{Flatlist|\n* 1978\u20131981\n* 1984\u20131997\n* 2008\n* 2011\n}}\n| creator        = [[Gordon Russell (writer)|Gordon Russell]]\n| introducer     = {{Plainlist|\n* Joseph Stuart\n* [[Paul Rauch]] (1984)\n* [[Frank Valentini]] (2008, 2011)\n}}\n| classification = [[List of One Life to Live characters|Past; recurring]]\n| image1         = Tina-AndreaEvans-2008-06-11.jpg\n| caption1       = Andrea Evans as Tina Lord\n| image2         = Tina-KarenWitter-1990.jpg\n| caption2       = Karen Witter as Tina Lord\n| image3         = Tina-Krista_Tesreau-1995.jpg\n| caption3       = Krista Tesreau as Tina Lord\n| alias          = {{Plainlist|\n* Tina Clayton\n* Tina Roberts\n* Tina Rogan\n* Tina Vickers\n}}\n| occupation     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Socialite]]\n* [[Trustee]] to the [[Lord family]] estate\n* Crown Princess \n* Personal shopper\n* Interior designer\n}}\n| family         = [[Lord family|Lord]]\n| father         = [[Victor Lord]]\n| mother         = [[Irene Manning (One Life to Live)|Irene Manning Lord]]\n| stepfather     = [[Ted Clayton (One Life to Live)|Ted Clayton]]\n| brothers       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Todd Manning]]\n* [[Victor Lord, Jr.]]\n}}\n| halfbrothers   = [[Tony Lord (One Life to Live)|Tony Lord]]\n| halfsisters    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Victoria Lord]]\n* [[Meredith Lord]]\n}}\n| spouse         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Cord Roberts]] (1986\u20131993, 2011){{efn|The first ceremony for Cord and Tina was in 1986.

She makes fast friends with Natalie, a relative newcomer and former fellow \"black sheep of the family,\" but Tina's once-loving relationship with Jessica is now fractious and antagonistic. Stunned by Jessica's cold and rude behavior, Tina is unaware that Jessica is actually \"Tess,\" her dangerous alternate personality, who has secretly emerged from Jessica's psyche to take control and seek revenge on Natalie and her lover [[Jared Banks]], whom Tess blames for the death of [[Nash Brennan]], Jessica's husband and the love of Tess's life. As Tina settles into Llanfair, she takes care to hide the stolen Mendorran Crown Jewels in Viki's wall safe, fearing she will be apprehended by international authorities. Tina grows increasingly suspicious of \"Jessica's\" strange actions when she discovers her niece has ordered construction to be done in the Llanfair basement. \"Jessica\" claims the construction work is a surprise for the family, but when Tina and her beloved [[shih tzu]] \"David Vickers\" go snooping in the basement, they discover the soundproofed secret room Tess has built below the house. Tina reflects on her memories of her father Victor Lord's own secret room, and its significance to Viki and her own alternate personalities, one of whom had imprisoned Dorian Lord below Llanfair. Remembering her own complicated relationship with Viki's alters such as Niki Smith, Tina realizes that Tess has emerged. Before Tina can alert the family, Tess traps her in the secret room.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5128/Enjoy_Your_New_Digs ''One Life to Live'' recap (9/3/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tess discovers the jewels in the safe and threatens to not only tell the authorities, but a vengeful Carlo as well. Fearing for herself and especially Sarah, Tina begrudgingly agrees to not only stay quiet, but to help Tess drag a drugged Natalie down into the secret room. A guilty Tina tries to thwart Tess several times, but is always caught; Tina sends Jared down to the basement to find Natalie, but Tess traps him as well. Viki returns to town in time to realize that Tess is on the loose. With a bomb set to go off, Tina leads Viki and Jared's father [[Charlie Banks (One Life to Live)|Charlie Banks]] down to the secret room in time to save Natalie and Jared. On November 14, 2008, Tina comes clean to a furious Viki, who tells Tina to leave and never return.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5551/You_Never_Know_Whos_Around_The_Corner ''One Life to Live'' recap (11/14/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tina says goodbye to a disappointed Sarah on November 25, 2008, too ashamed to explain why she is leaving town.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/> Tina  peers into Jessica's hospital room, sadly watching Viki, Clint and Natalie surrounding Jessica and her daughters \u2014 the family Tina may never be a part of again.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/> Finally, Tina goes to the crypt of her father Victor, curses him for the damage he has done to Viki and the rest of the family, and vows to return to Llanview someday.<ref name=\"Soaps 2008-11-25\"/>\n\n===2011===\nTina returns to Llanview with her dog David Vickers for the reading of Todd's will on September 27, 2011. She is shocked to discover that her mother Irene is alive and well, and that the brother who has just died is not Todd, but his secret twin brother, [[Victor Lord, Jr.|Victor Lord, Jr]]. Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts.

These two species can mate with each other ([[heterospecific]] mating), but it is in their best interest, for the viability and fecundity of their offspring, that they mate only within their species ([[conspecific]] mating). Male members of the two species try and court or mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. This female choice has caused the two species to diverge and become reproductively isolated.

There are several habitat-related reasons behind the drop in wood white butterfly. Researchers hypothesize that this could be due to the changing treatment of woodland areas, including over-planting of trees. Many of the woodlands where wood whites colonize were replanted in the last 50 years, leading to a large increase in the amount of shade over the woodland rides and shrubbery. Very little is understood about how to upkeep woodland areas so that they are sufficient for wood white colonization; this is the main area of research on conversation presently.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Conservation efforts ===\nThere have been efforts to recolonize areas of the United Kingdom as part of a 10-year plan to reintroduce more wood whites into the area. This recolonization involves maintaining woodland ride areas to minimize loss of vegetation and dispersing the butterflies strategically into woodland ride areas in Britain. Another major point of interest for the conservation effort is to examine how weather and climate change, particularly in the winter, affects pupation, since this process largely takes place over winter (called [[overwintering]] of the pupae).<ref name=\":5\" />[[Image:Leptidea sinapis1.jpg|thumb|200px]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of butterflies of Great Britain]]\n\n==References==<!-- Zootaxa1819:40. -->\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* Jim Asher ''et al.''

A female would not want to be subjected to the long courtship ritual only to bear the cost of having hybridized off-spring, so there is niche separation to prevent heterospecific mating.<ref name=\":4\" />\n[[File:Wood white (Leptidea sinapis) female 2.jpg|thumb|A female wood white]]\n\n== Migration ==\nThere is no local or regional migration of the wood white. The wood white is a [[bivoltine]] species, meaning that there are two generations of eggs that hatch in one year. The two generations of butterflies emerge and fly in May through June and secondly in July through August. Egg laying, hatching of the larvae, and pupation occur during the winter (over-wintering). Studies about how climate changes during the winter months affect pupation are being conducted to help develop conservation plans.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Jeffcoate|first=Stephen|last2=Joy|first2=Jenny|date=2011-12-01|title=Evidence-based National Recovery Plan for Leptidea sinapis (wood white butterfly) in Southern Britain|journal=Journal of Insect Conservation|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=759\u2013763|doi=10.1007/s10841-010-9374-3|issn=1366-638X}}</ref>\n\n== Mating ==\n\n=== Female-male interactions ===\n\n==== Mate choice ====\nThere are two reproductively isolated species of wood white called ''L. sinapis'' and ''L. reali.'' These two species can mate with each other ([[heterospecific]] mating), but it is in their best interest, for the viability and fecundity of their offspring, that they mate only within their species ([[conspecific]] mating). Male members of the two species try and court or mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. This female choice has caused the two species to diverge and become reproductively isolated. There is a time and energy cost that the females bear when males of the opposite species attempt to mate with them\u2014this cost has led to females occasionally acquiescing and mating with these males, leading to some degree of between-species hybridization.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Courting ====\nThere is an elaborate courtship ritual between wood whites, initiated by the male. They begin by wagging their head from one side to another, extending their [[proboscis]] towards the female. The female, with her antennae pulled back, would be unmoving if already mated and would immediately move their abdomen towards the male if not.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Balzende Senfwei\u00dflinge, Leptidea sinapis 01.JPG|thumb|Two wood whites courting]]\n\n==== Copulation and number of mates ====\nFemales mate only once in nature, while males can mate several times.<ref name=\":3\" /> This can be explained by the competing pressures that each sex faces. wood white males would need to mate with as many conspecific females as possible to maximize the number of viable offspring, while females benefit from only mating once, since the egg-laying process of choosing the best food-plant on which to oviposit is so time and energy intensive\u2014mating multiple times would not be a good use of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiklund|first=C.|date=1977|title=Courtship Behaviour in Relation to Female Monogamy in Leptidea sinapis (Lepidoptera)|jstor=3543614|journal=Oikos|volume=29|issue=2|pages=275\u2013283|doi=10.2307/3543614}}</ref>\n\n== Physiology ==\n\n=== Flight ===\nAdult wood whites fly slowly, and they appear to flutter.

An analysis of the relationship between the ''Phlox-Coliasis'' pollination system and the ''L.'' sinapis which feeds on the nectar, displays that the pollination efficiency is around 1%, extremely low for the need to successfully pollinate the host population. Thus, rather than being considered a mutualistic relationship, the ''L.'' sinapis is considered a parasite to the flowers from which they feed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiklund|first=Christer|last2=Eriksson|first2=Torsten|last3=Lundberg|first3=Hans|date=1979|title=The Wood White Butterfly Leptidea sinapis and Its Nectar Plants: A Case of Mutualism or Parasitism?|jstor=3544323|journal=Oikos|volume=33|issue=3|pages=358\u2013362|doi=10.2307/3544323}}</ref>\n\n== Threats ==\n\n=== Predators ===\nPredators of the wood white eggs are largely unknown, but lead to 90-98% of all egg deaths.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Parasites ===\nThe [[Chalcid wasp|chalcid fly]] parasitizes the wood white eggs and accounts for only a small percentage of egg death. The larvae are parasitized by ''Cotesia vitripennis'' and ''C. anchisiades,'' which are two wasp species.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Habitat fluctuations ===\nRapid changes in shade (tree-cover, buildings, etc.) in the woodlands where the butterflies lay their eggs and moist or colder weather during ovipositing season contribute to the lower quantities of adult wood whites during the months of June through August.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Conservation ==\n\n=== Habitat loss ===\nThe wood white butterfly was named a UK BAP Priority Species candidate in 2005, due to the substantial drop in population size in the last quarter century. There are several habitat-related reasons behind the drop in wood white butterfly. Researchers hypothesize that this could be due to the changing treatment of woodland areas, including over-planting of trees. Many of the woodlands where wood whites colonize were replanted in the last 50 years, leading to a large increase in the amount of shade over the woodland rides and shrubbery. Very little is understood about how to upkeep woodland areas so that they are sufficient for wood white colonization; this is the main area of research on conversation presently.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Conservation efforts ===\nThere have been efforts to recolonize areas of the United Kingdom as part of a 10-year plan to reintroduce more wood whites into the area. This recolonization involves maintaining woodland ride areas to minimize loss of vegetation and dispersing the butterflies strategically into woodland ride areas in Britain. Another major point of interest for the conservation effort is to examine how weather and climate change, particularly in the winter, affects pupation, since this process largely takes place over winter (called [[overwintering]] of the pupae).<ref name=\":5\" />[[Image:Leptidea sinapis1.jpg|thumb|200px]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of butterflies of Great Britain]]\n\n==References==<!-- Zootaxa1819:40. -->\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* Jim Asher ''et al.''
