The outbreak, with 41 continual hours of tornado activity, was one of the longest-lasting and largest fall tornado outbreaks in the United States<ref name=Record>{{harvnb|Grazulis|2001|p=247}}</ref> Published studies of this outbreak report widely varying numbers of confirmed tornadoes (92, 94, 146 and 143, with the higher numbers reflected in NOAA studies).\n\n<!--A number of records were established by this outbreak - it is both the longest-lasting (with 41 continual hours of tornado activity) and largest (in number of tornadoes) fall tornado outbreak in the U.S., though it should be noted that published studies of this outbreak report widely varying numbers of confirmed tornadoes (92, 94, 146 and 143, with the higher numbers reflected in NOAA studies). -->\nThe outbreak began on November 21 with a cluster of six tornadoes, ranging from [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1 to F4 intensities]], that struck parts of the [[Greater Houston|Houston metropolitan area]]. Later on the same day, the deadliest tornado of the outbreak, a long-tracked F4 tornado, struck [[Brandon, Mississippi]], causing 10 deaths, 98 injuries and over $25 million in damage.  Other F4 tornadoes struck [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]], GA, in the [[Atlanta]] suburbs, and [[Switzerland County, Indiana]], just southwest of [[Cincinnati]].  Of the five tornadoes reported in North Carolina on November 22\u201323, the last left a damage path over {{convert|160|mi|km|}} in length (at consistent F2-F3 intensity), the longest tornado damage track to have ever been recorded in the state, producing damage in [[Wilson, North Carolina|Wilson]] and [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]].  The last tornado of the outbreak, a short-lived F1, touched down in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=95 | F0=12 | F1=36 | F2=26 | F3=15 | F4=6 | F5=0 }}<!--Only add once confirmed by NWS offices-->\n\n===November 21 event===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!'''[[Fujita scale|F#]]'''\n!'''Location'''\n!'''County''' \n!'''Time (UTC)'''\n!'''Path length'''\n!'''Damage'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=center|'''[[Texas]]'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat1}} | <big>'''F1'''</big>\n|'''NE of [[Glen Flora, Texas|Glen Flora]]''' \n| [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton]]\n| 1930\n| 0.5 miles (0.8&nbsp;km)\n| This and the following event damaged or destroyed many barns.<ref name=StormData /> \n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat1}} | <big>'''F1'''</big>\n|'''NE of [[Jones Creek, Texas|Jones Creek]]''' \n| [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton]]\n| 1940\n| 1 miles (1.6&nbsp;km)\n| Same as the above.\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat1}} | <big>'''F1'''</big>\n|'''W of [[Wharton, Texas|Wharton]]''' \n| [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton]]\n| 2015\n| 1 miles (1.6&nbsp;km)\n| One unoccupied home was destroyed.\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat2}} | <big>'''F2'''</big>\n|'''NE of [[Foster, Texas|Foster]] to W of [[Deco, Texas|Deco]]''' \n| [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]]\n| 2020\n| 25 miles (40&nbsp;km)\n| Tornado began in the [[Cinco Ranch, Texas|Cinco Ranch]] area before moving into [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], where roofs and walls were removed from homes, garages were destroyed, and some homes under construction collapsed.

Also sometimes referred to as the '''Widespread Outbreak''' (as was the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] initially), this exceptionally long lasting and geographically large outbreak produced over $300 million in damage, along with 26 deaths and 641 injuries in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]]. The outbreak, with 41 continual hours of tornado activity, was one of the longest-lasting and largest fall tornado outbreaks in the United States<ref name=Record>{{harvnb|Grazulis|2001|p=247}}</ref> Published studies of this outbreak report widely varying numbers of confirmed tornadoes (92, 94, 146 and 143, with the higher numbers reflected in NOAA studies).\n\n<!--A number of records were established by this outbreak - it is both the longest-lasting (with 41 continual hours of tornado activity) and largest (in number of tornadoes) fall tornado outbreak in the U.S., though it should be noted that published studies of this outbreak report widely varying numbers of confirmed tornadoes (92, 94, 146 and 143, with the higher numbers reflected in NOAA studies). -->\nThe outbreak began on November 21 with a cluster of six tornadoes, ranging from [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1 to F4 intensities]], that struck parts of the [[Greater Houston|Houston metropolitan area]]. Later on the same day, the deadliest tornado of the outbreak, a long-tracked F4 tornado, struck [[Brandon, Mississippi]], causing 10 deaths, 98 injuries and over $25 million in damage.  Other F4 tornadoes struck [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]], GA, in the [[Atlanta]] suburbs, and [[Switzerland County, Indiana]], just southwest of [[Cincinnati]].  Of the five tornadoes reported in North Carolina on November 22\u201323, the last left a damage path over {{convert|160|mi|km|}} in length (at consistent F2-F3 intensity), the longest tornado damage track to have ever been recorded in the state, producing damage in [[Wilson, North Carolina|Wilson]] and [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]].

In the late 1960s, Didion's reportage brought Californian subcultures to wider attention. Her political writing often concentrated on the subtext of rhetoric. In 1991, she wrote the earliest mainstream media article to suggest the [[Central Park Five]] had been wrongfully convicted. In 2005, she won the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]] and was a finalist for both the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Biography/Autobiography for ''[[The Year of Magical Thinking]]''. She later adapted the book into a play, which premiered on Broadway in 2007. In 2017, Didion was profiled in the Netflix documentary ''[[Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold|The Center Will Not Hold]]'', directed by her nephew [[Griffin Dunne]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJoan Didion was born on December 5, 1934, in [[Sacramento, California]],<ref name=\"AA\">{{cite web|title= Joan Didion Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/joan-didion/#interview}}</ref> to Frank Reese and Eduene (n\u00e9e Jerrett) Didion. Didion recalls writing things down as early as age five, though she says she never saw herself as a writer until after her work had been published. She read everything she could get her hands-on, and she even needed written permission from her mother to borrow adult books\u2014biographies especially\u2014from the library at a young age. She identified as a \"shy, bookish child\" who pushed herself to overcome social anxiety through acting and public speaking.<ref name=\"AA\"/>\n\nDidion attended kindergarten and first grade, but because her father was in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]] and her family was constantly relocated, she did not attend school on a regular basis. In 1943 or early 1944, her family returned to Sacramento, and her father went to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] to negotiate defense contracts for [[World War II]]. Didion wrote in her 2003 memoir ''[[Where I Was From]]'' that moving so often made her feel like a perpetual outsider.<ref name=\"AA\"/>\n\nIn 1956, Didion graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5601/joan-didion-the-art-of-nonfiction-no-1-joan-didion|title=Joan Didion, The Art of Nonfiction No. 1|first=Hilton|last=Als|accessdate=September 14, 2017|date=Spring 2006|newspaper=[[The Paris Review]]}}</ref> During her senior year, she won first place in the \"Prix de Paris\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiamuseum.org/inductee/joan-didion|title=Joan Didion \u2013 California Museum|website=www.californiamuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}</ref> essay contest sponsored by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]],'' and was awarded a job as a research assistant at the magazine, having written a story on the San Francisco architect [[William Wurster|William Wilson Wurster]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Joan Didion|url=http://www.thejoandidion.com/about/|website=TheJoanDidion.com|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/books/didion-calif.html|title=Joan Didion: Staking Out California|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=1979-06-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDuring her seven years at ''Vogue'', Didion worked her way up from promotional copywriter to associate feature editor.<ref name=\":0\" /> While there, and homesick for California, she wrote her first novel, ''[[Run River]]'', which was published in 1963.

The following year, she published the novel ''[[Democracy (novel)|Democracy]]'', which narrates the story of a long but unrequited love affair between a wealthy heiress and an older man, a CIA officer, against the background of the [[Cold War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Her 1987 nonfiction book ''[[Miami (book)|Miami]]'' looked at the [[Cubans|Cuban]] expatriate community in that city.\n\nIn a prescient [[New York Review of Books]] piece of 1991, a year after the various trials of the [[Central Park Five]] had ended, Didion dissected serious flaws in the prosecution's case, becoming the earliest mainstream writer to view the guilty verdicts as a miscarriage of justice.<ref>New York Review of Books\n[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1991/01/17/new-york-sentimental-journeys/ New York: Sentimental Journeys]</ref> She suggested the obtaining of convictions against the Five had resulted from a sociopolitical narrative with racial overtones that had clouded the judgement of the court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/film-voice-men-falsely-convicted-central-park-jogger/story?id=18037863|title=Film Gives Voice to Men Falsely Convicted in Central Park Jogger Case|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=December 21, 2012|author=Cristina Costantini}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/koch-central-park-five-and-end-doubt/|title='Koch', 'The Central Park Five' and the End of Doubt|magazine=[[The Nation]]|date=April 17, 2013|author=Gene Seymour}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebulwark.com/the-problem-with-when-they-see-us/|title=The Problem With \"When They See Us\"|publisher=[[The Bulwark (website)|The Bulwark]]|date=June 24, 2019|author=Cathy Young}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, she published ''[[After Henry (book)|After Henry]]'', a collection of twelve geographical essays and a personal memorial for Henry Robbins, who was Didion's friend and editor from 1966 until his death in 1979. In 1996, she published ''[[The Last Thing He Wanted]]'', a romantic thriller. Dunne and Didion worked closely together for most of their careers. Much of their writing is therefore intertwined. The two co-wrote a number of screenplays, including a [[Play It as It Lays (film)|1972 film adaptation]] of her novel ''[[Play It as It Lays|Play It As It Lays]]'' that starred [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Tuesday Weld]]. The couple also spent eight years adapting the biography of journalist [[Jessica Savitch]] into the film ''[[Up Close & Personal]]''.\n\nDidion began writing ''[[The Year of Magical Thinking]],'' a narrative of her response to the death of her husband and severe illness of their daughter, Quintana Roo Dunne Michael, on October 4, 2004, and finished the manuscript 88 days later on New Year's Eve.<ref name=\"NYMag\">Jonathan Van Meter. \"[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/books/14633/ When Everything Changes]\".

Produced by [[Scott Rudin]], the Broadway play featured [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

This style is also described as creative nonfiction, intimate journalism, or literary nonfiction. It is a popular moment in the long history of literary journalism in America. [[Tom Wolfe]], who along with E.W. Johnson edited the anthology ''[[The New Journalism]]'' (1973), and wrote a manifesto for the style that popularized the term, pointed to the idea that \"it is possible to write journalism that would ... read like a novel.\"<ref name=\"Masterpiece\">A Masterpiece of Literary Journalism: Joan Didion's Slouching towards Bethlehem \u2013 Feb. 2006, Volume 3, No. 2 (Serial No. 26), Sino-US English Teaching, {{ISSN|1539-8072}}, USA</ref> New Journalist writers tend to turn away from \"just the facts\" and focus more upon the dialogue of the situation and the scenarios that the author may have experienced. The style gives the author more creative freedom. This can help to represent the truth and reality through the author's eyes. Exhibiting subjectivity is a major theme in New Journalism. Here, the author's voice is critical to a reader forming opinions and thoughts concerning the work.<ref name=\"Braman\">Sandra Braman. \"[http://www.english.upenn.edu/~despey/didion.htm Joan Didion]\".</ref>\n\nDidion's ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem'' exemplifies much of what New Journalism represents as it explores the cultural values and experiences of American life in the 1960s. Didion includes her personal feelings and memories in this first person narrative, describing the chaos of individuals and the way in which they perceive the world. Here Didion rejects conventional journalism, and instead prefers to create a subjective approach to essays, a style that is her own.\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nDidion views the structure of the sentence as essential to what she is conveying in her work. In ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, ''Why I Write'' (1976)<ref name=\"Why\">Why I Write by Joan Didion, New York Times (1857-Current file); December 5, 1976; ProQest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2005) pg. 270</ref> Didion remarks, \"To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed...The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind...The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what's going on in the picture.\"<ref name=\"Why\" />\n\nDidion is heavily influenced by [[Ernest Hemingway]], whose writing taught Didion the importance of the way sentences work within a text. Other influences include writer [[Henry James]], who wrote \"perfect, indirect, complicated sentences\" and [[George Eliot]].<ref name=\"Art\">\"[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3439/the-art-of-fiction-no-71-joan-didion The Art of Fiction No. 71: Joan Didion]\". ''The Paris Review'', No. 74 (Fall-Winter 1978).</ref>\n\nBecause of her belief that it is the media that tells us how to live, Joan Didion has become an observer of journalists themselves.<ref name=\"Braman\"/> She believes that the difference between the process of fiction and nonfiction is the element of discovery that takes place in nonfiction. This happens not during the writing, but during the research.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nThere are rituals that are a part of Didion's creative thought process. At the end of the day, Didion must take a break from writing to remove herself from the \"pages\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> She feels closeness to her work; without a necessary break, she cannot make proper adjustments. Didion spends a great deal of time cutting out and editing her prose before concluding her evening. The next day, Didion begins by looking over her work from the previous evening, making further adjustments as she sees fit. As this process culminates, Didion feels that it is necessary to sleep in the same room as her book. In Didion's own words, \"That's one reason I go home to Sacramento to finish things. Somehow the book doesn't leave you when you're right next to it.\"<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nIn a notorious essay published in 1980 called \"Joan Didion: Only Disconnect\", [[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]] called Didion a \"[[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]] [[Cher]]\" whose style was \"a bag of tricks\" and whose \"subject is always herself.\"<ref>Harrison, Barbara Grizzutti (1980) \"Joan Didion: Only Disconnect\" in ''Off Center: Essays.''

In the late 1960s, Didion's reportage brought Californian subcultures to wider attention. Her political writing often concentrated on the subtext of rhetoric. In 1991, she wrote the earliest mainstream media article to suggest the [[Central Park Five]] had been wrongfully convicted. In 2005, she won the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]] and was a finalist for both the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Biography/Autobiography for ''[[The Year of Magical Thinking]]''. She later adapted the book into a play, which premiered on Broadway in 2007. In 2017, Didion was profiled in the Netflix documentary ''[[Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold|The Center Will Not Hold]]'', directed by her nephew [[Griffin Dunne]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJoan Didion was born on December 5, 1934, in [[Sacramento, California]],<ref name=\"AA\">{{cite web|title= Joan Didion Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/joan-didion/#interview}}</ref> to Frank Reese and Eduene (n\u00e9e Jerrett) Didion. Didion recalls writing things down as early as age five, though she says she never saw herself as a writer until after her work had been published. She read everything she could get her hands-on, and she even needed written permission from her mother to borrow adult books\u2014biographies especially\u2014from the library at a young age.

This style is also described as creative nonfiction, intimate journalism, or literary nonfiction. It is a popular moment in the long history of literary journalism in America. [[Tom Wolfe]], who along with E.W. Johnson edited the anthology ''[[The New Journalism]]'' (1973), and wrote a manifesto for the style that popularized the term, pointed to the idea that \"it is possible to write journalism that would ... read like a novel.\"<ref name=\"Masterpiece\">A Masterpiece of Literary Journalism: Joan Didion's Slouching towards Bethlehem \u2013 Feb. 2006, Volume 3, No. 2 (Serial No. 26), Sino-US English Teaching, {{ISSN|1539-8072}}, USA</ref> New Journalist writers tend to turn away from \"just the facts\" and focus more upon the dialogue of the situation and the scenarios that the author may have experienced. The style gives the author more creative freedom. This can help to represent the truth and reality through the author's eyes. Exhibiting subjectivity is a major theme in New Journalism. Here, the author's voice is critical to a reader forming opinions and thoughts concerning the work.<ref name=\"Braman\">Sandra Braman. \"[http://www.english.upenn.edu/~despey/didion.htm Joan Didion]\".</ref>\n\nDidion's ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem'' exemplifies much of what New Journalism represents as it explores the cultural values and experiences of American life in the 1960s. Didion includes her personal feelings and memories in this first person narrative, describing the chaos of individuals and the way in which they perceive the world. Here Didion rejects conventional journalism, and instead prefers to create a subjective approach to essays, a style that is her own.\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nDidion views the structure of the sentence as essential to what she is conveying in her work. In ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, ''Why I Write'' (1976)<ref name=\"Why\">Why I Write by Joan Didion, New York Times (1857-Current file); December 5, 1976; ProQest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2005) pg. 270</ref> Didion remarks, \"To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed...The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind...The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what's going on in the picture.\"<ref name=\"Why\" />\n\nDidion is heavily influenced by [[Ernest Hemingway]], whose writing taught Didion the importance of the way sentences work within a text. Other influences include writer [[Henry James]], who wrote \"perfect, indirect, complicated sentences\" and [[George Eliot]].<ref name=\"Art\">\"[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3439/the-art-of-fiction-no-71-joan-didion The Art of Fiction No. 71: Joan Didion]\". ''The Paris Review'', No. 74 (Fall-Winter 1978).</ref>\n\nBecause of her belief that it is the media that tells us how to live, Joan Didion has become an observer of journalists themselves.<ref name=\"Braman\"/> She believes that the difference between the process of fiction and nonfiction is the element of discovery that takes place in nonfiction. This happens not during the writing, but during the research.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nThere are rituals that are a part of Didion's creative thought process. At the end of the day, Didion must take a break from writing to remove herself from the \"pages\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> She feels closeness to her work; without a necessary break, she cannot make proper adjustments. Didion spends a great deal of time cutting out and editing her prose before concluding her evening. The next day, Didion begins by looking over her work from the previous evening, making further adjustments as she sees fit. As this process culminates, Didion feels that it is necessary to sleep in the same room as her book. In Didion's own words, \"That's one reason I go home to Sacramento to finish things. Somehow the book doesn't leave you when you're right next to it.\"<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nIn a notorious essay published in 1980 called \"Joan Didion: Only Disconnect\", [[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]] called Didion a \"[[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]] [[Cher]]\" whose style was \"a bag of tricks\" and whose \"subject is always herself.\"<ref>Harrison, Barbara Grizzutti (1980) \"Joan Didion: Only Disconnect\" in ''Off Center: Essays.''
