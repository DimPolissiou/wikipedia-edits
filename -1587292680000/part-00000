We have been in six competitions in two years and we won every one of them. I think they can lay claim to being one of the greatest camogie teams ever to play the game now. The amount of work that went in was phenomenal. We did it because [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] loves camogie and loves GAA.\nThey weren't letting us run at them. It was the way it was in [http://www.rappstars.com/ Bellefield] earlier in the year, a game that was talked about an awful lot. People had said a lot of things about [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] camogie, especially the senior team. People questioned our girl's hunger. People questioned our desire, said that [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] were going to be hungrier than us. They questioned a lot of things about the team. We wanted to get the opportunity to answer them. Thankfully we have done that.\nIt is very hard to put into words what I feel right now. I feel extremely proud of the girls, all 48 that have been training with us. The first half seemed to go on for hours and the second half just flew by. Then we got into injury time and I thought it would never end. Anyone looking at that out there today will see that [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] camogie is made of very very stern stuff. You don\u2019t play for as many years as these girls have and not have the character.\nWhen [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] got the goal lesser teams would have buckled. I have learned a lot about the girls and they have learned a lot about themselves.\u201d </blockquote>\nThe losing manager [[Noel Finn]] of [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] stood down on the Sunday night of the All-Ireland final:\n<blockquote>I am very, very disappointed. Last year was hard to take but losing again today was devastation. The girls are devastated in there. We all are. Sport can be cruel, great when you win, very very hard to take when you lose. Scrappy first half. Two points downat half time, I felt we were in the game. We came out with all guns blazing in the second half. When we went three points in front and I thought we would have pushed on. Instead [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] came back at us. They got the scores and they finished us. It was very, very exciting there. Anyone could have won as it went down to the wire. After they got the goal they sort of pushed on.\u201d </blockquote>\n\n==Media reaction==\nMedia coverage was generally favourable, praising the intensity and excitement of the game, sometimes at the expense of individual skill. Three times All Ireland medalist [[Therese O\u2019Callaghan]], a television analyst said \u201cGalway did very little wrong today while her co-analyst [[Stellah Sinnott]], a former [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] manager said \u201cthe second half had everything you could look for in an All-Ireland final.

You won\u2019t see better than that anywhere. Everything is just on precision, on the dot.

It was a sucker punch that late, they got their dander up. They were winning the breaks and when you\u2019re on the back foot it is very hard to try and push on.<ref name=\"galwaynews.ie\">[http://www.galwaynews.ie/21571-so-close-and-yet-so-far-once-again-galway Connacht Tribune: So close and yet so far once again for Galway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826035457/http://www.galwaynews.ie/21571-so-close-and-yet-so-far-once-again-galway |date=2012-08-26 }}</ref>\nIt brought the initiative back to [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] after they had dominated the first half, having taken the initiative with a penalty scored by [[Una Leacy]] (4 minutes, but fallen three points behind after a snap goal scored by [[Tara Ruttledge]] (37 minutes).\nGalway led by 1-8 to 1-5 after 50 minutes, but failed to score in the last ten minutes. Finn pondered:\n<blockquote> \u201cWhen you go 10 minutes without scoring, especially the last 10 minutes, you\u2019re not going to hold out. They got the break and they took their scores. When Tara got the goal I thought we would drive on because we were hurling well at that stage, but [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] dug deep and got the result and its heartbreak again for us this year, I just thought when [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] went in front they killed the game, that\u2019s experience, we have to learn, it\u2019s very hard to lose two finals. I said coming up here today we were well prepared, better than last year and if we played to our ability we would have got a result. [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] hit us hard, and fair play to them they are All Ireland champions and we have to suffer the consequences of losing another All Ireland.\u201d<ref name=\"galwaynews.ie\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Attendance & TV Audience==\nThe attendance of 14,974 was the sixth highest ever for a camogie-only final day in [[Croke Park]].

The final minutes of the game attracted a peak of 303,000 viewers. A further 3,312 viewed on live web feed.\n\n==Management reaction==\nWinning manager [[JJ Doyle]] of [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] said:\n<blockquote>\u201dWhat the [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] teams achieved out there today I doubt ever will be achieved again. We have been in six competitions in two years and we won every one of them. I think they can lay claim to being one of the greatest camogie teams ever to play the game now. The amount of work that went in was phenomenal. We did it because [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] loves camogie and loves GAA.\nThey weren't letting us run at them. It was the way it was in [http://www.rappstars.com/ Bellefield] earlier in the year, a game that was talked about an awful lot. People had said a lot of things about [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] camogie, especially the senior team. People questioned our girl's hunger. People questioned our desire, said that [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] were going to be hungrier than us. They questioned a lot of things about the team. We wanted to get the opportunity to answer them. Thankfully we have done that.\nIt is very hard to put into words what I feel right now. I feel extremely proud of the girls, all 48 that have been training with us. The first half seemed to go on for hours and the second half just flew by. Then we got into injury time and I thought it would never end. Anyone looking at that out there today will see that [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] camogie is made of very very stern stuff. You don\u2019t play for as many years as these girls have and not have the character.\nWhen [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] got the goal lesser teams would have buckled. I have learned a lot about the girls and they have learned a lot about themselves.\u201d </blockquote>\nThe losing manager [[Noel Finn]] of [[Galway GAA#Camogie|Galway]] stood down on the Sunday night of the All-Ireland final:\n<blockquote>I am very, very disappointed. Last year was hard to take but losing again today was devastation. The girls are devastated in there. We all are. Sport can be cruel, great when you win, very very hard to take when you lose. Scrappy first half. Two points downat half time, I felt we were in the game. We came out with all guns blazing in the second half. When we went three points in front and I thought we would have pushed on. Instead [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] came back at us. They got the scores and they finished us. It was very, very exciting there. Anyone could have won as it went down to the wire. After they got the goal they sort of pushed on.\u201d </blockquote>\n\n==Media reaction==\nMedia coverage was generally favourable, praising the intensity and excitement of the game, sometimes at the expense of individual skill. Three times All Ireland medalist [[Therese O\u2019Callaghan]], a television analyst said \u201cGalway did very little wrong today while her co-analyst [[Stellah Sinnott]], a former [[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]] manager said \u201cthe second half had everything you could look for in an All-Ireland final.

His father was a luthier who also played guitar, as well his brother. \nHe began messing around with the guitar at the age of 5, played on and off for a few years, but did not start to actually practice until he was around 14-15. His first guitar was a 12 fret cheap nylon string that he inherited from his brother. His first electric guitar was a black [[Squier]] Stratocaster included in a guitar pack. \nHe has said that the moment he began taking the guitar seriously was when his cousins introduced him to both [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] and [[Michael Angelo Batio]]. Before this, he primarily focused on playing like [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Joe Satriani]]. During his teen years, he was able to teach himself all of the ''[[Best of the Beast]]'' by [[Iron Maiden]]. He attended a music school in England, but has never stated which one, but has credited it with helping him with practice schedules.\n\n===Falling in Reverse (2008\u20132015)===\n{{main|Falling in Reverse}}\nVincent joined [[Falling in Reverse]] in 2008 as a founding member of the band.

He has said the reason for doing this is to eliminate any extra hand and wrist movements, essentially making his playing much more efficient.\n\nJacky also states that his biggest influences as a child were his dad, brother, and bands like [[DragonForce]], [[Sonata Arctica]], [[Rhapsody of Fire]], [[Galneryus]], [[Heavenly (French band)|Heavenly]], [[Dragonland]], [[X Japan]], and [[Angra (band)|Angra]].<ref name=\"Guitarz Forever\"/><ref name=\"All That Shreds\"/> Jacky's brother also taught him how to tap on the guitar, as explained in his Alternative Press Interview.\n\n==Discography==\n\n;Solo\n*''[[Star X Speed Story]]'' (2013)\n*''[[Life Imitating Art]]'' (2018)\n\n;Falling in Reverse\n*''[[The Drug in Me Is You]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Fashionably Late (Falling in Reverse album)|Fashionably Late]]'' (2013)\n*''[[Just Like You (Falling in Reverse album)|Just Like You]]'' (2015)\n\n;Cry Venom\n*''[[Vanquish the Demon (Cry Venom album)|Vanquish the Demon]]'' (2016)\n\n;Collaborations\n*\"Death From Above\" by [[Oh, Sleeper]] ([[The Titan (EP)]], 2013)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqRAkf9d9T0|title=Oh, Sleeper - Death from Above ft.
