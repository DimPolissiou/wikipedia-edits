Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds \"have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth\" and, like Earth, \"contain animals and inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that \"if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.\nThe didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in \"Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds\" (1647).\nIn \"The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books\" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: \"We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place\". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested \"our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere\". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.\n\nThe possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th\u201319th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed \"cosmic pluralism\" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably \"[[Sector Four|Area 51]]\" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.\n\nIn the words of SETI's Frank Drake, \"All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.\n\nIn 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}</ref> In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).\n\nTheoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms.

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom, and its abundance in the visible universe, makes it the element most likely to provide the bases\u2014even exotic ones\u2014for the chemical composition of life on other planets.<ref>{{cite book |title=To Utopia and Back: The Search for Life in the Solar System |url=https://archive.org/details/toutopiabacksear0000horo |url-access=registration |publisher=W.

Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds \"have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth\" and, like Earth, \"contain animals and inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that \"if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.\nThe didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in \"Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds\" (1647).\nIn \"The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books\" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: \"We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place\". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested \"our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere\". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.\n\nThe possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th\u201319th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed \"cosmic pluralism\" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the \"Martian invasion\" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.\n\n===20th century===\n{{see also|Space exploration}}\n[[File:Arecibo message.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Arecibo message]] is a digital message sent to [[Messier 13]], and is a well-known symbol of human attempts to contact extraterrestrials.]]\n\nMost [[unidentified flying object]]s or [[List of UFO sightings|UFO sightings]]<ref>{{cite journal |first=Anne |last=Cross |title=The Flexibility of Scientific Rhetoric: A Case Study of UFO Researchers |journal=Qualitative Sociology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201334 |doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000015542.28438.41 |year=2004}}</ref> can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft, known [[astronomical object]]s, or as [[hoax]]es.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Ailleris |date=January\u2013February 2011 |title=The lure of local SETI: Fifty years of field experiments |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=68 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=2\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.12.011 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68....2A}}</ref> Nonetheless, a certain fraction of the public believe that UFOs might actually be of extraterrestrial origin, and, indeed, the notion has had influence on popular culture.\n\nThe possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably \"[[Sector Four|Area 51]]\" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.\n\nIn the words of SETI's Frank Drake, \"All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.\n\nIn 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}</ref> In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).\n\nTheoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. \"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]\", he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

Cf. [[#Opposition]]. }}\n\n{{term|term= Change of Engagement }}\n{{defn|1= An engagement of the opponent's blade in the opposite line. Changes of engagement are sometimes performed to place one fencer's blade on the side of his/her opponent\u2019s blade that he feels has an advantage, or could be just to fool with the opponent. Often, a bout with a left-handed fencer versus a right-handed will see both of them jockey for position with changes of engagements.}}\n\n{{term|term= Circle-Beat }}\n{{defn|1= Also Counter-Beat or Change-Beat. A beat that is preceded by a circle under the opponent's blade. This can provoke a reaction with a beat from an unexpected quarter.}}\n\n{{term|term= Circle-Parry }}\n{{defn|1= also counter-parry. A parry that moves in a circle to end up in the same position in which it started. A circle-parry usually traps an attack coming in a different line, but in the same high/low line. Thus, the parry 'Circle-Six' (circular outside-high) is effective against attacks in the Four line (inside-high). While commonly referred to as a \"counter-parry,\" due to the circular motion of the parry, a circle parry does not necessarily need to be don in response to a riposte}}\n\n{{term|term= Compound Attack }}\n{{defn|1= Also composed attack. An attack or riposte incorporating one or more feints to the opposite line that the action finishes in. A compound attack does not necessarily lose right of way during its execution; it just comprises more than one indirect action. Compound attacks are usually used to draw multiple reactions from an opponent, or against an opponent who uses complex parries. A counter-attack into a compound attack must hit a clear tempo ahead of the compound attack to be valid.}}\n\n{{term|term= Corps-\u00e0-corps }}\n{{defn|1= (French \"body-to-body\") The action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts. This is illegal in foil and sabre bouts, and is cause for the Referee (Director) to halt the fencing action. In \u00e9p\u00e9e, it does not violate the spirit of the game, but contact may not be accompanied with any brutality or forcefulness (intentional or not).}}\n\n{{term|term= Coul\u00e9 }}\n{{defn|1= ''(Archaic)'' Also graze, glis\u00e9, or glissade. An attack or feint that slides along the opponent's blade.

Also see, [[#Prise de Fer]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Counter-Attack }}\n{{defn|1= An attack made against, or into, an attack initiated by the opponent. In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does not have the right-of-way against the opponent\u2019s initiated attack. Counter-attacking is a common tactic in \u00e9p\u00e9e, where one may gain a touch by hitting first, and avoiding the opponent\u2019s attack.

From en garde, push the front heel out by extending the front leg from the knee. Do not bend the front ankle, or lift up on the ball of the front foot. This means that the front foot must move forward prior to the body weight shifting forward. As the front leg extends, energetically push erect body forward with the rear leg. Rear arm extends during forward motion as a counterbalance. Land on the front heel and glide down into final position, with front shin perpendicular to the ground, and both heels on the floor. During this action, the torso should remain relatively erect, and not be thrown forward. Often, the back foot can be pulled along behind during an energetic lunge. It is important, and a fundamental characteristic of the lunge, to fully extend the back leg, obtaining full power from this spring-like extension.

This is because propagation of micro-cracks in the blade is approximately 10 times slower in maraging steel than in carbon-steel. It is a fencing urban myth that a maraging steel blade is designed to break flat; the breakage patterns are identical. Both maraging and non-maraging blades break with the same degree of jaggedness. The sole reason for requiring a maraging steel blade (or a non-maraging one that has the same longevity under FIE testing) is that fewer blade breaks means less potential for follow-on injury.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73&dq=maraging+steel+blade+injury+fencing&hl=en&ei=Kp9NTuuUGsi08QO75KGeBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=maraging%20steel%20blade%20injury%20fencing&f=false|title=Popular Mechanics \"Noncarbon steel in fencing weapons reduces the chances of breakage and injury.\"|date=July 1996|page=73|publisher=[[The Hearst Corporation]]}}</ref>}}\n\n{{term|term= Match }}\n{{defn|1= The aggregate of bouts between two fencing teams.}}\n\n{{term|term= Moulinet }}\n{{defn|1= In sabre, a circular cut.

A parry is usually only wide enough to allow the attacker's blade to just miss; any additional motion is wasteful. A well-executed parry should take the foible of the attacker's blade with the forte and/or guard of the defender's. This provides the greatest control over the opponent's blade. In sabre, the guard should be turned appropriately using the fingers to protect the wrist.\n\nParries generally cover one of the 'lines' of the body.  The simplest parries move the blade in a straight line.  Other parries move the blade in a circular, semicircular, or diagonal manner.  There are eight basic parries, and many derivatives of these eight.  (see [[#Prime]], [[#Seconde]], [[#Tierce]], [[#Quarte]], [[#Quinte]], [[#Sixte]], [[#Septime]], [[#Octave]], [[#Neuvieme]]).  See also [[#Lines]].\n\nIn foil, the opponent's blade should not only be deflected away from the target, but away from off-target areas as well.  An attack that is deflected off the valid target but onto invalid target still retains right-of-way. In sabre, the opponent's blade need only be deflected away from valid target, since off-target touches do not stop the phrase.  Sabre parries must be particularly clean and clear to avoid the possibility of whip-over touches.  In \u00e9p\u00e9e, a good parry is simply any one that gains enough time for the riposte;  opposition parries and prise-de-fer are commonly used, since they do not release the opponent's blade to allow a remise.}}\n\n{{term|term= Pass Backwards }}\n{{defn|1= Also Passe Arriere.

A point-in-line is a static threat, created by one fencer by extending the weapon and arm prior to any actions in a phrase. In foil and sabre, a Point-in-line has right of way, therefore, if the line is not withdrawn, any attack launched by the opponent does not have right of way. This can be likened to a spear poking up from the ground: If you throw yourself upon it, you have only yourself to blame. A successful attack on the blade will invalidate a point-in-line or causing the opponent to withdraw his/her arm.

It has female threading, but unlike a nut the threaded hole does not pass through. It is screwed onto the distal end of the tang, locking guard, grip and electric connector is position by compression and friction. The pommel traditionally acts as a counterweight on non-orthopedic grips of foils and \u00e9p\u00e9es, and on all sabres. In electric sabre, it is covered with plastic as to not interfere with the detection of valid hits by allowing stray currents.

Posting is a trade-off: the fencer loses a little control over their blade work in return for the greater reach. This is most commonly done in \u00e9p\u00e9e, where there is no need to establish right of way and hitting first can award the touch. Technically it is not legal to slide the hand down the grip during an offensive action (see FIE t.16), so a fencer who wishes to post must do it while the action is stopped, or they risk a possible penalty.}}\n\n{{term|term= Preparation }}\n{{defn|1= Any action that precedes the actual launch of an attack. Preparation usually consists of actions against the opponents blade to take it out of line, or to provoke a reaction. In foil and sabre, any action that occurs during a phrase or conversation that precedes the establishment of right-of-way on the part of a fencer, often accompanied with a movement forward. In calling the actions in a foil or sabre bout, a referee may indicate preparation on the part of one fencer, meaning the fencer was moving forward without establishing right-of-way, and was vulnerable to an attack made during this time.}}\n\n{{term|term= Presentation }}\n{{defn|1= Offering one's blade for engagement by the opponent.}}\n\n{{term|term= Press }}\n{{defn|1= Also \"pressure.\" An attempt to push the opponent's blade aside or out of line from engaged blades. A press can precede a direct or indirect attack, depending on the opponent's reaction, but should be followed by an immediate threat (a full or partial extension). A press which is not followed by a threat may invite a disengage from the opponent, and an attack thereby. From an engagement, press smoothly on the opponent's foible, taking his/her blade out of line, and perhaps provoking a response. The thumb and fingers should provide the force behind this action.}}\n\n{{term|term= Pr\u00eats }}\n{{defn|1= French adjective for \"ready.\" Spoken by the director at outset to ask if fencers are ready to fight.

The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the inside low-line. (This is a rare sabre parry.) }}\n\n{{term|term= Priority }}\n{{defn|1= In sabre and foil, the rules that decide which fencer will be awarded the touch in the event that they both attack simultaneously; sometimes used synonymously with \"right-of-way.\" }}\n{{defn|2= In the 1995 revision of the rules for all weapons, priority also refers to rules dealing with a tie score. Priority is awarded when time expires with a tied score. The priority is determined by the flip of a coin at the start of the last minute, and the winner of the toss wins the bout if the score is tied when time expires.}}\n\n{{term|term= Prise de Fer |content= [[Prise de Fer]] }}\n{{defn|1= (French : Literally take the steel); also \u201cTaking the Blade\u201d; an engagement of the blades that attempts to control the opponent's weapon. See also [[#Beat]], [[#Press]], [[#Expulsion]], [[#Bind]], [[#Crois\u00e9]], [[#Envelopment]], [[#Opposition]], [[#Transfer]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Pronation }}\n{{defn|1= Having the hand in a position where the palm faces downwards.

Covers the inside high line.}}\n\n{{term|term= Quillion }}\n{{defn|1= Also quillon, cross-guard. A cross-bar style guard not utilized in modern fencing. The quillions (usually two), on historical swords, extend from the top of the hilt, perpendicular to the line of the blade, on the same plane as the edge(s) of the blade. In simple medieval swords, the quillions usually form the entire guard. In later, more complex hilts, rings and other protective structures were extended in front of the quillions. One or two fingers can be wrapped above the quillions, providing better control of the weapon but endangering some fingers. In olympic fencing weapons, the Italian grip is the only one that retains quillions.}}\n\n{{term|term= Quinte }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #5; blade up and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is higher than the hand. This parry, more than any other, is subject to different interpretations in different schools (in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e). In foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e, this parry generally covers the inside high line, since the pronated wrist can push further down than the supinated wrist (in Quarte). If the point and hand are lifted, this parry can also cover the inside low line with a sweeping action upwards, carrying the opponents point over the outside shoulder. In sabre, the blade is held above the head to protect from head cuts, but should still point slightly forward ready for riposte.}}\n\n{{glossary end}}\n\n== R ==\n{{glossary}}\n\n{{term|term= Rapier |content= [[Rapier]] }}\n{{defn|1= A long, double-edged thrusting sword, not used in modern fencing,<ref name=\"FIE\" /> popular in the 16th-17th centuries. Rapiers began as swords which were designed to use the point, in addition to heavy cuts. Some consider the \u2018estoc\u2019 a precursor to the rapier. As the styles of combat changed, and heavy armor was lightened, the rapier became more focused on the use of the point, and less on heavy cutting strokes. Hilts were designed to allow the forefinger to wrap around a quillion and provide better control. Hilts could be of complex 'swelp-hilt' design, or shaped like a deep cup.}}\n\n{{term|term= Recovery }}\n{{defn|1= A return to en garde stance from any other position, generally by pulling backwards into en garde. Recovery from a lunge occurs by reversing the motions in a lunge, and recovering the extended arm last of all. A forward recovery involves moving the rear foot forward to return to en garde. For a center recovery, both feet move towards the center simultaneously.}}\n\n{{term|term= Red Card }}\n{{defn|1= Used to indicate repeated minor rule infractions or a major rule infraction by one of the fencers; results in a point being given to the other fencer, and often the annulment of any touch which would have been made by the offending fencer.}}\n\n{{term|term= Redoublement }}\n{{defn|1= An additional offensive action made after a previous offensive action (attack, riposte, counterattack or renewal) has failed and made with some further blade action, such as feints and disengages.

The mediator of the fencing bout.}}\n\n{{term|term= Renewal }}\n{{defn|1= An offensive action made immediately after a previous offensive action has missed or been parried. There are three types of renewal: the [[#Remise]] (direct), the [[#Redoublement]] (indirect or compound) and the [[#Reprise]] (made after returning to the en garde position).}}\n\n{{term|term= Remise }}\n{{defn|1= An immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. A remise is a direct continuation, meaning that no deceptions or changes of line occur with the continuation (replacement) of the attack. In foil and sabre, a remise does not have right of way over an immediate riposte. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Reprise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Reprise }}\n{{defn|1= A new attack executed immediately after a return to the en garde position. Specifically, this most often refers to the movement of bringing up the back foot from the lunge and lunging again to renew the attack against an opponent who caused the initial attack to miss by retreating. A reprise may be direct, indirect, or compound. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Remise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Retreat }}\n{{defn|1= The basic backwards movement. Rear foot reaches backwards and is firmly planted, then front leg pushes body weight backwards smoothly into 'en garde' stance.}}\n\n{{term|term= Right-of-Way }}\n{{defn|1= The rules for awarding the point in the event of a double touch in foil or sabre. The concept involved in being the first to establish a valid threat to an opponent's target area. Extending is the usual means to establishing this threat. Breaking the extended arm during an attack means relinquishing right-of-way. An opponent can take right-of-way by parrying the opponents blade.}}\n\n{{term|term= Riposte }}\n{{defn|no=1|1= An attack made immediately after a parry of the opponent's attack.}}\n{{defn|no=2|1= An attack with right-of-way following a valid parry.

Performed at the start and end of a bout (match, assault, etc.), and also at the start and end of a lesson. At the start of a bout, it is traditional, and expected, to salute the adversary, the referee of the bout, any additional judges for the bout, and then, optionally, others (the timekeeper, scorekeeper, etc.). The FIE rules now state that failure to salute an opponent and shake his/her hand at the end of a bout is an offense punishable by a black card - meaning elimination from the competition.}}\n\n{{term|term= Second-Intention }}\n{{defn|1= In general, a term used to imply that the first action initiated is ''not'' the one intended to score. The fencer may initiate a move, anticipating (or intending to draw) a certain response from the opponent, against which a second action is planned. For example, Lunge Attack (anticipating that it will be parried), Parry the riposte, and hit with a Counter-Riposte.}}\n\n{{term|term= Seconde }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #2; blade down and to the outside, wrist pronated.

A counter-attack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack. A properly performed Stop Hit allows a fencer to counter-attack into an oncoming attack, hit his opponent, and then still parry the oncoming attack (allowing a possible valid riposte as well). It may try to break the continuance of an attack by 'stopping' into it. However, it is still a Counter-attack, and does not have Right-of-Way against a continuous attack.}}\n\n{{term|term= Strip |content= [[Piste (fencing)|Strip (Piste)]] {{anchor|Piste}} }}\n{{defn|1= The fencing area, 14 metres long and between 1.5 and 2 metres wide. Going off the side of the strip with one foot or both halts the fencing action and gets a penalty of the loss of one metre. The last two metres on each end is hash-marked, to warn a fencer before he/she backs off the end of the strip. Going off the back of the piste with both feet results in a hit being awarded to the opponent. After each touch, fencers begin again at the center of the strip, 4 metres apart.}}\n\n{{term|term= Supination }}\n{{defn|1= The position of the hand when the palm is facing up.

Sabre uses all the body area above the waist, except the hands and the back of the head.}}\n\n{{term|term= Third Intention }}\n{{defn|1= There is first intention which is a simple attack or thrust. There is second intention in which the attacker seeks to deceive their opponent before the actual thrust. Third intention goes further with two or more actions intended to deceive or place the defender in a position favorable to the attacker. Aldo Nadi stated in his book \"On Fencing\" that \"The great fencer uses the latter (2nd intention) predominantly, exploiting their value and comparative safety to the utmost. But this is not all.

Cf. [[#Opposition]]. }}\n\n{{term|term= Change of Engagement }}\n{{defn|1= An engagement of the opponent's blade in the opposite line. Changes of engagement are sometimes performed to place one fencer's blade on the side of his/her opponent\u2019s blade that he feels has an advantage, or could be just to fool with the opponent. Often, a bout with a left-handed fencer versus a right-handed will see both of them jockey for position with changes of engagements.}}\n\n{{term|term= Circle-Beat }}\n{{defn|1= Also Counter-Beat or Change-Beat. A beat that is preceded by a circle under the opponent's blade. This can provoke a reaction with a beat from an unexpected quarter.}}\n\n{{term|term= Circle-Parry }}\n{{defn|1= also counter-parry. A parry that moves in a circle to end up in the same position in which it started. A circle-parry usually traps an attack coming in a different line, but in the same high/low line. Thus, the parry 'Circle-Six' (circular outside-high) is effective against attacks in the Four line (inside-high). While commonly referred to as a \"counter-parry,\" due to the circular motion of the parry, a circle parry does not necessarily need to be don in response to a riposte}}\n\n{{term|term= Compound Attack }}\n{{defn|1= Also composed attack. An attack or riposte incorporating one or more feints to the opposite line that the action finishes in. A compound attack does not necessarily lose right of way during its execution; it just comprises more than one indirect action. Compound attacks are usually used to draw multiple reactions from an opponent, or against an opponent who uses complex parries. A counter-attack into a compound attack must hit a clear tempo ahead of the compound attack to be valid.}}\n\n{{term|term= Corps-\u00e0-corps }}\n{{defn|1= (French \"body-to-body\") The action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts. This is illegal in foil and sabre bouts, and is cause for the Referee (Director) to halt the fencing action. In \u00e9p\u00e9e, it does not violate the spirit of the game, but contact may not be accompanied with any brutality or forcefulness (intentional or not).}}\n\n{{term|term= Coul\u00e9 }}\n{{defn|1= ''(Archaic)'' Also graze, glis\u00e9, or glissade. An attack or feint that slides along the opponent's blade. In performing a sliding action along the opponent\u2019s blade, it is generally the goal to establish leverage by moving forte against foible, or forte to forte. Also see, [[#Prise de Fer]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Counter-Attack }}\n{{defn|1= An attack made against, or into, an attack initiated by the opponent. In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does not have the right-of-way against the opponent\u2019s initiated attack. Counter-attacking is a common tactic in \u00e9p\u00e9e, where one may gain a touch by hitting first, and avoiding the opponent\u2019s attack. Counter-attacks, especially in \u00e9p\u00e9e, are often accompanied by an action on the blade (beat, opposition, prise-de-fer, transfer).}}\n\n{{term|term= Counter-Parry }}\n{{defn|1= A second, third, or further parry done in the fencing 'phrase,' typically against a [[#riposte]] or counter-riposte, and often as a result of [[#Second-Intention]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Counter-Riposte }}\n{{defn|1= A second, third, or further riposte in a fencing 'phrase' or encounter.

From en garde, push the front heel out by extending the front leg from the knee. Do not bend the front ankle, or lift up on the ball of the front foot. This means that the front foot must move forward prior to the body weight shifting forward. As the front leg extends, energetically push erect body forward with the rear leg. Rear arm extends during forward motion as a counterbalance. Land on the front heel and glide down into final position, with front shin perpendicular to the ground, and both heels on the floor. During this action, the torso should remain relatively erect, and not be thrown forward. Often, the back foot can be pulled along behind during an energetic lunge. It is important, and a fundamental characteristic of the lunge, to fully extend the back leg, obtaining full power from this spring-like extension.

This is because propagation of micro-cracks in the blade is approximately 10 times slower in maraging steel than in carbon-steel. It is a fencing urban myth that a maraging steel blade is designed to break flat; the breakage patterns are identical. Both maraging and non-maraging blades break with the same degree of jaggedness. The sole reason for requiring a maraging steel blade (or a non-maraging one that has the same longevity under FIE testing) is that fewer blade breaks means less potential for follow-on injury.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73&dq=maraging+steel+blade+injury+fencing&hl=en&ei=Kp9NTuuUGsi08QO75KGeBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=maraging%20steel%20blade%20injury%20fencing&f=false|title=Popular Mechanics \"Noncarbon steel in fencing weapons reduces the chances of breakage and injury.\"|date=July 1996|page=73|publisher=[[The Hearst Corporation]]}}</ref>}}\n\n{{term|term= Match }}\n{{defn|1= The aggregate of bouts between two fencing teams.}}\n\n{{term|term= Moulinet }}\n{{defn|1= In sabre, a circular cut.

A parry is usually only wide enough to allow the attacker's blade to just miss; any additional motion is wasteful. A well-executed parry should take the foible of the attacker's blade with the forte and/or guard of the defender's. This provides the greatest control over the opponent's blade. In sabre, the guard should be turned appropriately using the fingers to protect the wrist.\n\nParries generally cover one of the 'lines' of the body.  The simplest parries move the blade in a straight line.  Other parries move the blade in a circular, semicircular, or diagonal manner.  There are eight basic parries, and many derivatives of these eight.  (see [[#Prime]], [[#Seconde]], [[#Tierce]], [[#Quarte]], [[#Quinte]], [[#Sixte]], [[#Septime]], [[#Octave]], [[#Neuvieme]]).  See also [[#Lines]].\n\nIn foil, the opponent's blade should not only be deflected away from the target, but away from off-target areas as well.  An attack that is deflected off the valid target but onto invalid target still retains right-of-way. In sabre, the opponent's blade need only be deflected away from valid target, since off-target touches do not stop the phrase.  Sabre parries must be particularly clean and clear to avoid the possibility of whip-over touches.  In \u00e9p\u00e9e, a good parry is simply any one that gains enough time for the riposte;  opposition parries and prise-de-fer are commonly used, since they do not release the opponent's blade to allow a remise.}}\n\n{{term|term= Pass Backwards }}\n{{defn|1= Also Passe Arriere.

A point-in-line is a static threat, created by one fencer by extending the weapon and arm prior to any actions in a phrase. In foil and sabre, a Point-in-line has right of way, therefore, if the line is not withdrawn, any attack launched by the opponent does not have right of way. This can be likened to a spear poking up from the ground: If you throw yourself upon it, you have only yourself to blame. A successful attack on the blade will invalidate a point-in-line or causing the opponent to withdraw his/her arm.

It has female threading, but unlike a nut the threaded hole does not pass through. It is screwed onto the distal end of the tang, locking guard, grip and electric connector is position by compression and friction. The pommel traditionally acts as a counterweight on non-orthopedic grips of foils and \u00e9p\u00e9es, and on all sabres.

Posting is a trade-off: the fencer loses a little control over their blade work in return for the greater reach. This is most commonly done in \u00e9p\u00e9e, where there is no need to establish right of way and hitting first can award the touch. Technically it is not legal to slide the hand down the grip during an offensive action (see FIE t.16), so a fencer who wishes to post must do it while the action is stopped, or they risk a possible penalty.}}\n\n{{term|term= Preparation }}\n{{defn|1= Any action that precedes the actual launch of an attack.

In foil and sabre, any action that occurs during a phrase or conversation that precedes the establishment of right-of-way on the part of a fencer, often accompanied with a movement forward. In calling the actions in a foil or sabre bout, a referee may indicate preparation on the part of one fencer, meaning the fencer was moving forward without establishing right-of-way, and was vulnerable to an attack made during this time.}}\n\n{{term|term= Presentation }}\n{{defn|1= Offering one's blade for engagement by the opponent.}}\n\n{{term|term= Press }}\n{{defn|1= Also \"pressure.\" An attempt to push the opponent's blade aside or out of line from engaged blades. A press can precede a direct or indirect attack, depending on the opponent's reaction, but should be followed by an immediate threat (a full or partial extension). A press which is not followed by a threat may invite a disengage from the opponent, and an attack thereby. From an engagement, press smoothly on the opponent's foible, taking his/her blade out of line, and perhaps provoking a response. The thumb and fingers should provide the force behind this action.}}\n\n{{term|term= Pr\u00eats }}\n{{defn|1= French adjective for \"ready.\" Spoken by the director at outset to ask if fencers are ready to fight. Full commencing phrase is \"En garde! Pr\u00eats? Allez!\" (For two female fencers, \"pr\u00eats\" becomes \"pr\u00eates.\")}}\n\n{{term|term= Prime }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #1: blade down and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the inside low-line. (This is a rare sabre parry.) }}\n\n{{term|term= Priority }}\n{{defn|1= In sabre and foil, the rules that decide which fencer will be awarded the touch in the event that they both attack simultaneously; sometimes used synonymously with \"right-of-way.\" }}\n{{defn|2= In the 1995 revision of the rules for all weapons, priority also refers to rules dealing with a tie score. Priority is awarded when time expires with a tied score. The priority is determined by the flip of a coin at the start of the last minute, and the winner of the toss wins the bout if the score is tied when time expires.}}\n\n{{term|term= Prise de Fer |content= [[Prise de Fer]] }}\n{{defn|1= (French : Literally take the steel); also \u201cTaking the Blade\u201d; an engagement of the blades that attempts to control the opponent's weapon. See also [[#Beat]], [[#Press]], [[#Expulsion]], [[#Bind]], [[#Crois\u00e9]], [[#Envelopment]], [[#Opposition]], [[#Transfer]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Pronation }}\n{{defn|1= Having the hand in a position where the palm faces downwards.

Covers the inside high line.}}\n\n{{term|term= Quillion }}\n{{defn|1= Also quillon, cross-guard. A cross-bar style guard not utilized in modern fencing. The quillions (usually two), on historical swords, extend from the top of the hilt, perpendicular to the line of the blade, on the same plane as the edge(s) of the blade. In simple medieval swords, the quillions usually form the entire guard. In later, more complex hilts, rings and other protective structures were extended in front of the quillions. One or two fingers can be wrapped above the quillions, providing better control of the weapon but endangering some fingers. In olympic fencing weapons, the Italian grip is the only one that retains quillions.}}\n\n{{term|term= Quinte }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #5; blade up and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is higher than the hand. This parry, more than any other, is subject to different interpretations in different schools (in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e). In foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e, this parry generally covers the inside high line, since the pronated wrist can push further down than the supinated wrist (in Quarte). If the point and hand are lifted, this parry can also cover the inside low line with a sweeping action upwards, carrying the opponents point over the outside shoulder. In sabre, the blade is held above the head to protect from head cuts, but should still point slightly forward ready for riposte.}}\n\n{{glossary end}}\n\n== R ==\n{{glossary}}\n\n{{term|term= Rapier |content= [[Rapier]] }}\n{{defn|1= A long, double-edged thrusting sword, not used in modern fencing,<ref name=\"FIE\" /> popular in the 16th-17th centuries. Rapiers began as swords which were designed to use the point, in addition to heavy cuts. Some consider the \u2018estoc\u2019 a precursor to the rapier. As the styles of combat changed, and heavy armor was lightened, the rapier became more focused on the use of the point, and less on heavy cutting strokes. Hilts were designed to allow the forefinger to wrap around a quillion and provide better control. Hilts could be of complex 'swelp-hilt' design, or shaped like a deep cup.}}\n\n{{term|term= Recovery }}\n{{defn|1= A return to en garde stance from any other position, generally by pulling backwards into en garde. Recovery from a lunge occurs by reversing the motions in a lunge, and recovering the extended arm last of all. A forward recovery involves moving the rear foot forward to return to en garde. For a center recovery, both feet move towards the center simultaneously.}}\n\n{{term|term= Red Card }}\n{{defn|1= Used to indicate repeated minor rule infractions or a major rule infraction by one of the fencers; results in a point being given to the other fencer, and often the annulment of any touch which would have been made by the offending fencer.}}\n\n{{term|term= Redoublement }}\n{{defn|1= An additional offensive action made after a previous offensive action (attack, riposte, counterattack or renewal) has failed and made with some further blade action, such as feints and disengages. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Remise]] and [[#Reprise]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Referee }}\n{{defn|1= also director, president. The mediator of the fencing bout.}}\n\n{{term|term= Renewal }}\n{{defn|1= An offensive action made immediately after a previous offensive action has missed or been parried. There are three types of renewal: the [[#Remise]] (direct), the [[#Redoublement]] (indirect or compound) and the [[#Reprise]] (made after returning to the en garde position).}}\n\n{{term|term= Remise }}\n{{defn|1= An immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. A remise is a direct continuation, meaning that no deceptions or changes of line occur with the continuation (replacement) of the attack. In foil and sabre, a remise does not have right of way over an immediate riposte. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Reprise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Reprise }}\n{{defn|1= A new attack executed immediately after a return to the en garde position. Specifically, this most often refers to the movement of bringing up the back foot from the lunge and lunging again to renew the attack against an opponent who caused the initial attack to miss by retreating. A reprise may be direct, indirect, or compound. See also [[#Renewal]], [[#Remise]] and [[#Redoublement]].}}\n\n{{term|term= Retreat }}\n{{defn|1= The basic backwards movement. Rear foot reaches backwards and is firmly planted, then front leg pushes body weight backwards smoothly into 'en garde' stance.}}\n\n{{term|term= Right-of-Way }}\n{{defn|1= The rules for awarding the point in the event of a double touch in foil or sabre. The concept involved in being the first to establish a valid threat to an opponent's target area. Extending is the usual means to establishing this threat. Breaking the extended arm during an attack means relinquishing right-of-way. An opponent can take right-of-way by parrying the opponents blade.}}\n\n{{term|term= Riposte }}\n{{defn|no=1|1= An attack made immediately after a parry of the opponent's attack.}}\n{{defn|no=2|1= An attack with right-of-way following a valid parry. A simple (or direct) riposte goes straight from the parry position to the target. A riposte may attack in any line. Consider its equivalent in a conversation.}}\n\n{{glossary end}}\n\n== S ==\n{{glossary}}\n\n[[Image:Fencing saber valid surfaces.svg|thumb|120px|A sabre fencer.

Indicates respect and good sportsmanship. A handshake is usually exchanged after a bout.}}\n{{defn|no=2|1= A gesture of respect and civility performed with the weapon. Performed at the start and end of a bout (match, assault, etc.), and also at the start and end of a lesson. At the start of a bout, it is traditional, and expected, to salute the adversary, the referee of the bout, any additional judges for the bout, and then, optionally, others (the timekeeper, scorekeeper, etc.). The FIE rules now state that failure to salute an opponent and shake his/her hand at the end of a bout is an offense punishable by a black card - meaning elimination from the competition.}}\n\n{{term|term= Second-Intention }}\n{{defn|1= In general, a term used to imply that the first action initiated is ''not'' the one intended to score. The fencer may initiate a move, anticipating (or intending to draw) a certain response from the opponent, against which a second action is planned. For example, Lunge Attack (anticipating that it will be parried), Parry the riposte, and hit with a Counter-Riposte.}}\n\n{{term|term= Seconde }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #2; blade down and to the outside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the outside low line in sabre, replacing octave.}}\n\n{{term|term= Semicircular Parry }}\n{{defn|1= A parry that moves from a high line to a low line, or vice versa. The parry can also cross the body. The parry must be made in a semicircle to provide the enveloping movement needed to trap the attacking blade.}}\n\n{{term|term= Septime }}\n{{defn|1= Parry #7; blade down and to the inside, wrist supinated.

A counter-attack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack. A properly performed Stop Hit allows a fencer to counter-attack into an oncoming attack, hit his opponent, and then still parry the oncoming attack (allowing a possible valid riposte as well). It may try to break the continuance of an attack by 'stopping' into it. However, it is still a Counter-attack, and does not have Right-of-Way against a continuous attack.}}\n\n{{term|term= Strip |content= [[Piste (fencing)|Strip (Piste)]] {{anchor|Piste}} }}\n{{defn|1= The fencing area, 14 metres long and between 1.5 and 2 metres wide. Going off the side of the strip with one foot or both halts the fencing action and gets a penalty of the loss of one metre. The last two metres on each end is hash-marked, to warn a fencer before he/she backs off the end of the strip. Going off the back of the piste with both feet results in a hit being awarded to the opponent. After each touch, fencers begin again at the center of the strip, 4 metres apart.}}\n\n{{term|term= Supination }}\n{{defn|1= The position of the hand when the palm is facing up.

Head, arms and legs are considered off-target in foil. \u00c9p\u00e9e uses the entire body for target. Sabre uses all the body area above the waist, except the hands and the back of the head.}}\n\n{{term|term= Third Intention }}\n{{defn|1= There is first intention which is a simple attack or thrust. There is second intention in which the attacker seeks to deceive their opponent before the actual thrust. Third intention goes further with two or more actions intended to deceive or place the defender in a position favorable to the attacker. Aldo Nadi stated in his book \"On Fencing\" that \"The great fencer uses the latter (2nd intention) predominantly, exploiting their value and comparative safety to the utmost. But this is not all.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

GASA is known to hold \"Late Night\" events on Thursdays, popular among students from all programs in the School.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engage/overview/faculty-and-school-associations/graduate-faculty-and-school-associations|title=Graduate Faculty and School Associations, Engage McGill|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)===\nAs of 2019, the School of Architecture has established a chapter of the [[American Institute of Architecture Students]], an international, non-profit, student-run organization dedicated to providing progressive programs, information and resources on critical issues to architecture students.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.aias.org/chapter/mcgill-university/|title=McGill University, Northeast Quad|publisher=American Institute of Architecture Students/accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Exchange and Study Abroad===\nThe Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture has close ties to several architecture schools across the world and has formal bilateral exchange agreements on a departmental level with seven schools in particular, including [[The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Politecnico di Milano]] in [[Milan]], [[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], [[\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Architecture de Paris-Belleville]], [[:fr:\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble|\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble]], [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]] in [[Brussels]] and [[TU Wien]] in [[Vienna]]. These bilateral agreements make it easy for undergraduate architecture students at McGill to go on exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/bscarch_programadvisingandcourseregistration-fall_2018.pdf|title=B.Sc.(Arch.) program and Architecture Exchange Students (New and Returning Students) - STUDENT EXCHANGES|page=5|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nStudents also have the opportunity to spend an exchange semester abroad at any of McGill University's 160+ partner institutions<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/mcgillabroad/mcgill-students-going-abroad/global-learning-opportunities|title=McGill students going abroad|publisher=McGill Abroad, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> as long as they offer architecture exchanges, however these are more difficult to coordinate due to the competitive nature of University-wide exchanges. In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 48 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios,<ref name=CACB /> the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in \"U0\", taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or first-year undergraduate (U1), but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=CACB />\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> As of 2018, the number of spaces has been reduced to 48.<ref name=CACB>{{cite web|url=https://cacb.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2018-McGill_University-VTR.pdf|title=2018 Visiting Team Report - Master of Architecture Program - McGill University|publisher=The Canadian Architectural Certification Board|page=16|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nEach year, the Master's program receives over 200 applicants, of which approximately 35 are admitted. Generally, about half of these students obtain their undergraduate degree from McGill, either from the BSc (Arch) program or another at the university.<ref name=CACB />\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir.
