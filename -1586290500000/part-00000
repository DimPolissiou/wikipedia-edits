Singer wrote: \"My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\"<ref>S. F.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

Singer responded with a letter to ''Science'' saying the IPCC report had presented material selectively. He wrote: \"the Summary does not even mention the existence of 18 years of weather satellite data that show a slight global cooling trend, contradicting all theoretical models of climate warming.\"<ref>Singer, Fred.

When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.<ref>Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned. At least 20 were television weather reporters, some did not have science degrees, and 14 were listed as professors without specifying a field.

He developed a new method of launching rockets into space: firing them from a high-flying plane, both with and without a pilot. The Navy adopted the idea and Singer supervised the project.

CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C.

Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum|T\u00f8jhus Arsenal]] and [[B\u00f8rsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Ark\u00e6ologer graver ny teori om K\u00f8benhavn op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} \nThe natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=K\u00f8benhavn \u2013 historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=K\u00f8benhavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''K\u00f8bmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14\u201315</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]].
