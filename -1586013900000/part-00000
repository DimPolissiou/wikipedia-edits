He works as a government 17th grade officer and earns Rs 65,000 monthly. His whole world revolves around his wife Mehwish ([[Ayeza Khan]]) and son Roomi. He loves them immensely. Even though he doesn't earn much, he tries to give them all the happiness in the world. On the other hand, Mehwish keeps coming up with wishes that she knows her husband will go to any extent to fulfil. Her desires are influenced by her best friend Anoushey ([[Mehar Bano]]), who keeps reminding Mehwish on how much she is missing out on in life just because she married Danish. Mehwish sees a Necklace at a mall and demands that Danish purchase it for her. Eager to please the love of his life, Danish decides to take the shortcut and use his position as a government officer to earn some extra cash via corruption. At first, Danish is afraid, but after witnessing how easily his boss gets away with bribery, Danish is now determined to take the risk to provide his family with all the luxuries. He gets a right start at this wrong path and finally buys the much-hyped necklace for Mehwish. However, when he arrives home, Danish finds out that Mehwish and Rumi have gone shopping with Mehwish's best friend, Anoushey. Where Mehwish is mature and understands the financial situation of her family, she is also under continuous peer pressure whenever she is with Anoushey. She borrows money from Anoushey to purchase the exact same necklace without knowing that Danish has already bought it for her. After indulging in shopping, Mehwish and Anoushey go to a restaurant for lunch, where we are introduced to Anoushey's brother's boss, Shehwar Ahmad ([[Adnan Siddiqui]]).\n\nShehwar Ahmed is a successful businessman and Anoushey's family friend. However, his marriage life is unsuccessful. His wife lives in the US due to their marital issues and Shehwar is free to flirt and date whomever he pleases. Shehwar and Mehwish meet for the first time at the restaurant and Shehwar couldn't help but praise Mehwish's beauty. She goes home and tells Danish about the necklace. Danish is disheartened, however, he does not tell Mehwish about the necklace that he bought. Instead, he gives Mehwish money to give back to Anoushey. Later that evening, Danish and Mehwish attend Anoushey's brother's Mehndi function, where Shehwar is also attending as a guest. Danish instantly notices Shehwar's lustful gaze on his wife and feels uncomfortable. Shehwar asks Mehwish for a dance. Mehwish is flattered but later politely declines. Danish sees the two talking and feels upset. He asks Mehwish to dance with him and she agrees after resisting at first. Shehwar asks Anoushey to go over and dance with Danish so that he could manipulate Mehwish into dancing with him. He uses this time to corrupt her thoughts by saying that a woman of her beauty and grace deserves much better than Danish. Danish sees Shehwar holding Mehwish close while dancing and is instantly furious. He tells Mehwish that they need to leave immediately and they head home without having eaten dinner. Once they reach home, Mehwish fights with Danish and asks him what is wrong with dancing. He tells her how disheartening it was for him to see another man holding his wife. He tells her that instead of being angry, she should feel ashamed. Mehwish feels insulted that her husband could be so insecure. Danish apologies and admits that his love for her makes him possessive and that he would go to any extent to keep Mehwish to himself. He also tells her that Mehwish should not worry about how others see her, but rather how her husband sees her.\n\nDanish leaves to bring food, as they left the event without eating. Frazzled by what happened at the Mehndi, Danish is almost hit by a car, whose driver turns out to be Shehwar. He senses Danish's unease and offers to give him a ride home. Danish refuses and returns home without the food and goes to sleep. The next day Mehwish and Roomi go shopping and accept a ride from their neighbour, Monty. Monty has eyes for Mehwish, but she doesn't see it that way. Danish is aware of this and does his best to protect his wife from the gaze of other men. Monty flirts with Mehwish in the car and tells her that she and Danish don't belong together. Danish finds out that Mehwish is in the car with Monty and leaves work to confront Monty. The two men get into an altercation. Danish arrives home bleeding and Mehwish argues that Danish is at fault, when Danish argues that Mehwish is blind to how men ogle at her and try to get close to her. Mehwish promises to be careful next time. Danish encourages Mehwish to attend Anoushey's brother's wedding without him, as he doesn't want to be seen with his bruised face, but much to Mehwish's surprise, he ends up attending the wedding and befriends Shehwar. Later, Shehwar drives them home and invites their family to his house for dinner, which they accept. The following day Shehwar calls Mehwish, saying that he has perhaps mistaken her number with Danish's and flirts with her, praising her beauty and her voice.\n\nDanish is offered a bribe of 10 lakh at work and is made to take the money home to think about it for a day or two.  Danish understands the weight of this decision \u2013 taking the money goes against his morals and those that he was taught by his father.  However, he also believes that he will never be able to afford the fine things in life or even the necessities if he does not venture on this path.  He discusses the situation with Mehwish, his emotional turmoil visible, but ultimately decides to take the bribe. Danish and Mehwish discuss their plans about the 10 lakhs that have come their way.  Planning on buying a new car, new clothes and so forth, Danish expresses his disbelief that this money belongs to him.  He goes so far as to approach Monty, despite their street brawl, and offers to buy his car.  While Monty does not believe him and asks where he got the money, insinuating that Mehwish is \"working,\" triggering Danish, who leaves in anger.  The next morning when Monty approaches him, he says he will not buy the car from him and asks him to leave. Mehwish, on the other hand, starts talking to Shehwaar on the phone on a daily basis when Danish leaves for the office.  Shehwar leaves no stone unturned to flirt with Mehwish and make her feel as though he only has eyes for her.\n\nAt work, Danish has a run-in with his boss when he is expected to sign off on paperwork that is unethical.  He returns the money, unable to compromise on his ethics. That night, the two (plus Roomi) visit Shahwaar for dinner, where Shahwaar takes any moment with Danish not in the room to flirt with Mehwish.  He has one on one discussions with her in the hall, telling her that any man would feel as though he needs nothing else if he had her. Later, before the two leave, Shehwar gifts Mehwish a necklace and asks Danish to put it on her. After returning home Danish begins to notice the change in his wife, pointing out that Mehwish used to complain when men leered at her and yet, she doesn't even notice Shehwar's inappropriate stares.  Mehwish brushes it off, but it's clear that she is taken in and impressed by Shehwar's wealth and charisma.  It also becomes clear that she enjoys the attention, something even Danish begins to realize.  While Danish works, Shehwar drops by his home and visits Mehwish (though he does not come in).  Their daily conversations continue, Shehwar becomes bold with his declarations towards Mehwish and offers Mehwish a job in his office with a monthly income of Rs 1 lakh.\n\nDanish arrives home and the watchman at the gate tells him that Shehwar came to the building, asking for Danish's apartment number. Danish confronts Mehwish and she denies it at first, then admits that she lied in fear of Danish's anger. Danish forgives her but insists that they return Shehwar's expensive gifts back to him. After Danish leaves to return the gifts, Mehwish calls Shehwar to give him a heads-up and Shehwar assures her that he can handle Danish. Once Danish arrives, Shehwar pacifies him by discussing his own loneliness and the joy he receives in their company. He sways Danish to the extent that Danish agrees to allow Mehwish to work for Shehwar.\n\nOnce at the office, Shehwar and Mehwish seem to begin their affair, something that they now have more freedom to carry out. Danish is the only one in this situation who is getting affected emotionally and physically. He is unable to focus on his work as he keeps thinking about Mehwish and Shehwar. He knows that he gave Mehwish permission to work for Shehwar, yet his heart is telling him that something wrong with his wife's boss is showering her with a new car, a driver and advanced salary. Mehwish is flying high thinking that's all she deserves. She starts comparing Shehwar with Danish and thinks about all the stuff she's missed out so far. Slowly, she begins \u2020o neglect her family and doesn't attend her son's first day of school. Shehwar insists that he cannot spend a day in the office without Mehwish's presence. Shehwar tricks Mehwish into attending a business trip with him to Islamabad. Mehwish does not tell Danish about the trip and believes she will be back home before Danish realises. She tells Danish that she needs to work late and Shehwar assures her that she will be back home before 9:00 pm. As luck would have it, their return flight gets delayed due to a storm and the audience sees a startled Mehwish, who is lying in bed at a hotel. She panics at first but Shehwar reassures her that they will get the next immediate flight out. They return at 10:30 instead of 9 pm, by which time Danish has discovered that Shehwar is in Islamabad. Sensing the worst, he rushes to the airport, and his fears are confirmed when he sees his wife and Shehwar arriving together. Danish takes Mehwish home on his bike and she asks him to stop so they can talk.\n\nShe asks him if he will beat her for lying to him, to which he replies that it was just a mistake and that there was nothing to worry about, even though he has tears running from his eyes. He realises what she has done but he forgives her, and simply prohibits her from returning to work the next day. The next day, Shehwar comes to the office and is surprised to hear that Mehwish has not come to work. After the airport incident, Danish tries his best to return to the way things were before but Mehwish is distracted with the thoughts of Shehwar. It is revealed through a flashback in the hotel room that Shehwar is influencing her thoughts and more directly pushing her to make the decision of choosing life with him. Mehwish knocks on his room and declares she is ready to \"get off at the next stop..\" confirming that she is more than considering leaving Danish.  This scene also implies that the relationship turned physical which Shehwar had planned it all along. After an evening out, Mehwish creates an argument with Danish, even though he tells her that he does not think bad of her and that he would like to move on from this incident. He swears at Shehwar and says he has ill intentions towards her boss. Mehwish immediately asks him to not swear at Shehwar and also that if Danish is over the incident then let her go back to the office which he refuses straight away. Mehwish declares that she is tired of their relationship and she wants nothing to do with Danish anymore. Danish seems to convince her the next day to calm down but as soon as he leaves for work she is on the phone to Shehwar. He asks her if she trusts him and that he will handle what needs to be done. He tells Mehwish to keep pushing separation from Danish and ask for a divorce.\n\nDanish borrow money from his boss and gathers the things gifted to Mehwish by Shehwar. As he is reaching Shehwar's office, Mehwish is on the phone and warns Shehwar in advance. Shehwar makes Danish wait in reception for a while as a show of authority. He tells Mehwish to pack her bags as he will ensure Danish divorces her tonight. Mehwish is concerned that he won't, but Shehwar tells her that Danish will divorce her. Danish is called in and tells him why he has come, he begins to return the advanced payment as well as the necklace. Shehwar starts to discuss the matter more directly and asks Danish why is he holding on to Mehwish if he can see that she wants to leave.\n\nTo further confirm this, he shows Danish the images of Mehwish in the hotel with him posing and wearing the infamous pink nighty. Danish is horrified and shocked, to add further the insult Shehwar also replays the recording of both speaking about he will convince Danish to divorce her. Danish visibly upset and speechless is then offered RS50 million to divorce her. Danish refuses the money and states that once a woman is bought, her value is worth nothing. Following an accident on his bike, Danish arrives home in bandages with the help of Monty. Mehwish shows no concern and Danish asks her to make a cup of tea. Shehwar calls Danish to ask him when he should come past their house to take Mehwish back with him. Danish says to come later in the evening, at a time when his son is asleep. Danish confronts Mehwish and tells her that he knows everything. He tells her that he went to Shehwar to save their love, but in the end, he barely managed to save their respect. He tells her that he saw the picture Shehwar took of her and that he can see that she is happy for once. She tells him to tell Roomi the truth after a few days as to not upset him if they ever cross paths randomly. Danish tells her to start packing but then asks if she is able to stay the night and leave in the morning instead when he is at work and their child is at school to which she agrees after consulting Shehwar. Mehwish asks Danish what deal he has done to for the divorce if he has taken money. Danish tells her he was offered the 50 million but refused it. He states that he never thought she would be sold so easy out on the street to which she states that he can do so much with that money. Danish says the money would never equal the peace and joy he had when he would come home from work to see her. Through a flashback at the office, Danish questions Shehwar about the thinking behind a woman who cheats. Also asking about how easy it was for Mehwish to visit the hotel with him, he tells Shehwar he has decided that he is letting go of Mehwish and he can collect her later that night. Shehwar is slightly confused about how direct and easy it was. Shehwar advises him to not hold on to a woman who is trying to leave as she has already left in her mind. This is repeated to Mehwish by Danish.\n\nSpeaking to Shehwar on the phone as Danish has gone for food, Mehwish discusses what has happened. Mehwish tells him that he has gone to get a cake to celebrate their wedding anniversary, Shehwar is amused and suggests that Danish has lost his mind. After bringing the food, he asks her to light the candles as he changes into clean clothes. Mehwish notices blood on her fingers which is Danish as his arm is bleeding, he cleans the wound himself. After lighting the candles he and her both blow the candles and Danish wishes her a long healthy life. Mehwish notices more blood on his arm and says she will bandage it but Danish refuses and says she has inflicted enough pain on him he can manage. Mehwish rings Shehwar again and explains what has happened then pleads with him to come collect her. Shehwar suggests he ask herself to which Danish laughs that he must he restless without her.He tells her he was the same when Shehwar took her to Islamabad for the night but at least she was her wife at the time. Danish tells her to ring him but as she is about to walk he away he says no need to go away and do it as there is no secrets between them anymore. He then hands her the divorce papers as she looks on with slight surprise. He starts to clean up but as she is trying to help him he tells her not to as he will be doing it from now on anyways. He tells her that he might be poor but he's not dirty. Shehwar arrives and is seated as Danish goes to make tea, Mehwish and him exchange glances as there is awkward silence. Danish makes the tea after Mehwish tries but says he never wants to drink from her hand ever again. Danish starts talking about how when they did love each other, he felt 6&nbsp;ft plus. Since this event he hasn't felt smaller as a person, he tells how the love of a woman can make a man feel invincible but when she's no longer interested the man feels turned away from God. Shehwar says times have changed and nowadays women do move on and regret the past and that they ever did love. He also further suggests a man should help pave the way such as Danish has done to help the woman move on. Danish says he has done exactly that by granting her divorce. Shehwar responds in glee that its great he has but Danish asks him to not call something like divorce great. He further embarrasses Shehwar by saying stealing from a broken home is not remotely great, Mehwish herself appears highly embarrassed. She says she will get things from her room but Danish forbids her and says her right for doing so was given away when he handed her the divorce papers. He goes and gets her luggage and says if they have finished their tea they can leave. Mehwish appears dejected and almost in a state of disbelief as she walks towards the door. As Danish and him shake hands, Danish says to Shehwar that he is surprised by looking at him as a businessman with all his charisma and told him he was an idiot to offer that much money for 2 but worthless woman. Mehwish is stunned hearing this and Shehwar is left speechless. They both make their way to the car as Danish lays next to Roomi with tears in his eyes. Shehwar and Mehwish look at each other in the car with only a slight smile, both still bemused as to what has happened.\n\nFew months have passed and Danish is sat with Mateen sahab discussing his intention to become a millionaire businessman, explaining how anything like loyalty, love and friendship can be bought. Danish also tells him how Roomi has slowly stopped asking about his mother and asked to be sent to a boarding school. He receives a letter from Roomi's headteachers asking for him to come in. As he is speaking to the headteacher she explains how Roomi is distant and failing in his grades. His teacher Ms Hania arrives and also states how she feels that he is not suited to the school as his classmates feel in danger from him. Danish explains something has happened which is the reason for his lack of interest and involvement. After both teachers agree to allow more time so Danish can speak to him, Ms Hania asks about his mother to which Danish angry states she has divorced him and left the country. Apologising for the outburst he explains that he will speak to Roomi and he will improve. Speaking to Roomi he explains how the loss is more for him and that she is still his mother. Roomi tells him that he does not want to he his fathers weakness and says if a mother leaves she isn't a mother either. At work Danish receives a promotion with a higher pay grade and is congratulated by Mateen. During lunch he explains how he is selling his apartment to start himself off in business and his intention to quit work so he can focus on business. Mateen sahab suggest that he does not rush into these things and for him to reconsider. At home Danish is upset after remembering how things used to be with Mehwish. She and Shehwar are both arriving back after a tour of Europe when she asks him when will they both marry. He laughs and responds that why spoil the good time they are having with thoughts of a lower class girl. He says they are both loving each other, if there is a need for marriage later they will. He then says that in marriage there is divorce but not when its love. Mehwish appears confused at this and slightly upset as Shehwar walks away. Danish meets Mateen sahab at a cafe where he says he has a buyer for his apartment. Mateen sahab again reiterates that he should hold on from quitting his job. He then tells him a time when he had a fall infront of his ex-wife who with her husband still.helped him. He asks her how she can still help him after the hurt he has given her she said to him that you feel sorry for the people who betray you, not hate. Mateen sahab upset at this then leaves where he has a heart attack in his car. Danish takes him to the hospital and calls his daughter from his mobile telling him what has happened. Sat waiting he see's Roomi teacher Ms Hania run into the hospital and realises she is Mateen sahab's daughter. The doctor comes to Danish and says he has passed away, Hania falls to the floor crying.\n\nDanish sits thinking about Mateen sahab and his last conversation as well as the funeral. The broker of the flat arrives and says he has been trying to contact him and that the buyer would like to make payment the next day. Danish asks him to delay it a few days with what has happened. Mehwish and Shehwar are sat having breakfast and she asks if he wouldn't mind Roomi coming to stay on the weekends to which he replies it's no problem. He tells her to call herself and arrange it then leaves for work. She calls and Hania answers, unaware that her late fathers and Danish phone was accidentally swapped. Mehwish asks for Danish and rudely speaks to her, Hania tells her to stop calling as it is not his number. She also receives a call from the broker who apologises for the mistake. Danish calls her and they realise that the phone was swapped so he says he will arrive shortly to drop it off. Just as he leaves the carpark, Mehwish arrives in a car after being advised by Shehwar to go herself and collect Roomi. The security for the apartments tells her she has just missed Danish, she says she will wait for him in the car. It is revealed that Danish has not told anyone about the divorce, instead just said that Mehwish and the kid are away due to work. She speaks to Shehwar who tells her that she should threaten legal action if Roomi isn't with her by the weekend. Danish sisters and speaks to Hania sharing memories about her father. She tells him Roomi has improved in class and that his education is her responsibility. She says to him that she is curious to meet his ex-wife, to see what a selfish unloving mother and wife looks like. Danish arrives and is shocked to see Mehwish in the car. She tries arguing in the carpark but he asks her into the flat as to not make a scene. He tells her he is happy for her to meet him etc but he will not allow him to go to Shehwar. He tells her he is at boarding and he is just about finally settled, if he says his mother with another man it will damage him. Mehwish ignores this and continues to argue that she will have him for the weekends. Danish again refuses so this time she threatens to take him to court where he will be disgraced. Danish snaps and shouts at her to get out. Speaking to a lawyer about his situation, he is advised against going to court due to the wealth and influence difference between him and Shehwar. He also says that a guy like Shehwar will not handle another man's child taking his attention away for too long so the situation will sort itself out rather than he lose in court. Shehwar receives a phone call and is told his shares have fallen. Already angry at this, he tells Mehwish that a threat alone is enough rather than go to court, he has no time to visit courts with her over this matter. He also says he only has weekends with her and won't if she has a child clung to her so she should just do day visits with him. He says to her he would rather her still look like a lover rather than a 50-year-old woman with a child to which Mehwish appears shocked. Mehwish arrives at the boarding school where Roomi hides when he sees her. Speaking to the headteacher she also meets Ms Hania. She then realises it was her that she spoke to on the phone. After saying she will be taking Roomi out, the head asks for a letter of permission from his father as this is the first time meeting his mother. Angry at this she says Roomi will meet her showing that she is indeed his mother but the head says rules are rules. They can meet but cannot leave the school premises. She either has to get a letter from Danish or a court order.\n\nFrustrated at not being able to take Roomi, she asks to meet him and Ms Hania goes to get him. Roomi refuses to meet her and says he does not want to see her anytime she comes. Mehwish is told this and explodes in anger, accusing the teachers of working with Danish against her. Hania tells her firmly that she needs to show respect to who she is talking to and that she only is repeating what Roomi told her, she cannot force him. Mehwish is then told by the head that she will not be allowed on the premises if she behaves in this manner. Hania calls Danish and tells him what has happened and tells him that a child should not be forced against his will. Danish then receives a call from Shehwar who gives him 2 days to ensure that Roomi meets his mum or else his lawyers will tear into him. Danish meets Roomi and tries to convince him to meet his mother or else he will face huge trouble from them, Roomi laughs and says to him that he is the weakness for him. These words take an effect on Danish who is conflicted about what to do. His mind is made up when he overhears a group of men who work for Shehwar, discussing the financial trouble and that he is spending all his money on a new girlfriend. He discusses his change of mind with both Hania and Roomi that he will be a man ot strength and character. After ringing Shehwar that he will discuss the matter face to face, Danish changes into a nice suit and cleans up his look. Arriving at the office, Shehwar has informed his secretary to keep him waiting for an hour but Danish expects this and walks in. Locking the door he approaches a surprised Shehwar and slaps him to the ground. Making his subordinates watch, Danish says he has come to discuss the matter as said before. Shehwar tries to threaten him and call the police but Danish slams him to the table and says he will do plenty of damage before the police come. Visibly scared, Shehwar pleads with him to let him go. Danish sits him down and says by the time his lawyers and goons get to him, he can disgrace Shehwar within minutes. He tells him you might have bought my ex-wife but don't ever threaten me over my son. Danish says if he does try to get between them again, he will strip him down infront of the rest of his employees. After telling Shehwar workers that they can use this incident to their advantage as he will be too embarrassed to say or do anything before walking out.\n\nDanish and Roomi are enjoying a day out at the zoo, they discuss how he beat Shehwar which makes Roomi happy and says how proud he is of him. He jokingly tells Danish to ask his teacher to marry him which Danish laughs off. Shehwar arrives at home and Mehwish is concerned as to why he is bleeding. After learning about the office incident she asks about what happened with the Roomi situation and Shehwar angrily tells her he wont meet her unless Roomi decides to himself. He shouts at her that because of his having to deal with situation he got beat up. She says don't hesitate on my behalf but Shehwar excuses it that if anything happens to Danish the suspicions will fall on them both. Roomi and Ms Hania sit and talk about him meeting his mother, she tries to convince him but Roomi falls silent then says he still does not want to. He blames Shehwar for what has happened but Hania quickly says it's his mothers fault, she then changes the subject. She asks why does your father not marry and Roomi tells her he himself has found a girl but he wont agree. Mehwish still angry at Shehwar, she argues that he claimed his threat meant something. He thinks back to Danish threatening him but tells her to speak to Danish himself. He says he can get him killed for 30,000 rupees in Karachi if he wanted but is hesitant because of her. He lies to her and says he wont forgive him for what happened but she has to try herself first. Danish is moving out of his apartment as some neighbour's discuss he is moving out because of his wife's betrayal. Danish meets them all to say goodbye and makes up with Monty due to their past differences, Monty apologises for his actions in the past. \nShehwar is informed that his shares have dropped further because of the 2 day strike at his chemical plant. During this he receives a call from Mehwish and angrily tells her to not disturb him. He tells his manager to increase the wages of staff to meet their demands and production to start immediately. Mehwish arrives at the apartment but is told Danish has sold up and left without telling anyone where he is going to. She rings and tells Shehwar who wrongly assumes Danish sold up because he was scared of him. Danish overhears the same group of men who work for Shehwar discussing the strike and the stock price drop. Shehwar sits drinking and is upset about the fall in profits from the strike and the wage increase. He says to her that they are both in a bad situation, his business and her not seeing her own son. She says she has left it in the hands of god but Shehwar mockingly tells her don't blame god for your own actions, he is never happy with a divorce seeking woman. He suggests they go to London for a week to which Mehwish says only after they marry, to avoid the conversation he says he is drunk and wants to sleep. Meanwhile, Danish speaks to an old university friend who works as a stock broker and asks to meet him. They meet in the morning and discuss how Danish wants to make money by investing his money, he finally tells him about what has happened with Mehwish. He is adamant to only buying Shehwar chemical shares, telling his friend that Mehwish has ran off with the CEO. At her home, Mehwish answers the telephone but nobody speaks. She tells Shehwar they received a call from the US and he tells her don't answer again if it rings. It does ring again but Mehwish walks away without answering. Danish has come to view an apartment to rent, costing over 1lakh a month which he puts down a deposit. His stock broker calls him and says his investment has paid off, the stock price of Shehwar chemicals has jumped but Danish is not surprised to hear this.\n\nHania and her friends arrive at a restaurant where she spots Danish alone. Whilst speaking to him, Mehwish arrives with Shehwar but do not notice him sat there. This upsets Danish who asks Hania to sit with him for a few minutes as he does not feel too good, he then leaves without eating. \nThe next day Danish is travelling with his estate agent to a car show room where he purchases a car. Receiving a call from the broker who advises him that share prices are good at the moment so he buys a small amount. Shehwar and Mehwish seem to have finalised getting a nikkah done as she refuses to meet him face to face until the ceremony is done. During a shopping trip she bumps into Anoushey and tells her what has happened during lunch. She is surprised at this and tells her if she knows that Shehwar defrauded his first wife and that the house belongs to her. Not bothered by this, Mehwish says once she arrives from the US it will all be sorted. Getting ready as a bride for the nikkah, there is a knock on the door. Maham ([[Savera Nadeem]]) walks in and slaps Mehwish and tells her that she is Shehwar Ahmed wife.\n\nWhilst driving, Danish is thinking about the past with Mehwish from how things used to be to when she said she wanted to leave him. He receives a call from Hania who scolds him for leaving Roomi alone. She says he needs a mother with him and for Danish to marry, he replied that the girl he is talking about is herself Hania so she quickly puts the phone down.\nShehwar gets arrested by the anti corruption and police squad, who inform him that the accuser is his wife Maham. He pleads with her to stop this as it is insulting, she replies that it's only just started. As he is led away Maham goes back to Mehwish who is sat crying. She asks her where is she from and if anything where does she belong right now. Ordering her to gather her stuff and leave Mehwish says she has nowhere to go to which Maham tells Dewan to give her money than she expects and to leave. She tells her she is lucky she wasn't arrested and that her punishment has already been given, the rest of her sentence will be out on the roads. Telling her that looking at her she is beautiful that she feels sorry for her but at the same time so ugly that she wanted to spit on her face. The driver takes her to the city centre but she asks if he could drop her off at her old apartment, he says even though they have moved out he will. Dewan and Maham discuss the matter, she asks if Mehwish was mistreated by her husband to which he says it appeared that he loved her so much he never raised his voice to her. Maham finds it hard to believe that a woman given so much love would act this way. Mehwish arrives at the apartment carpark and ask the guard to contact Danish, he says he does not no where he is and would not say even if he did. He tells her to leave the area as not many people know what happened as she would lose respect. The next day she meets Roomi at the school gates, she asks why did he not come see her and if his father had stopped him but he says it was his own choice. Asking if she could see him regular, he says maybe come once a month then leaves. The driver informs Danish that a woman come to meet Roomi and he confirms that it was his mother. Mehwish goes to the jail where Shehwar is held but he refuses to meet her as he is worried his wife will have him hung. He tells her to go back to her husband. Mehwish is further upset hearing this and says she agrees with his wife that she is from nowhere and a cheap woman. She calls Salman who feigns ignorance about the whole situation, she cries and says she needs help. He tells her to come to his house later. At their home, Danish meets Roomi who tells him about his mother. He says that she was crying and looked like she wanted to ask for forgiveness. Danish is told by Salman that Shehwar has been arrested on fraud charges.\n\nDanish does not comment on the Shehwar arrest and Salman tells this to Mehwish who has come to their home sitting with Aisha. He tells her he cannot offer a job at his workplace as Danish is his partner, he asks her to leave a current address and he will find her something. She asks if it's possible to stay the night with them to which he agrees but Aisha refuses. She says she has seen the hurt in Danish eyes and she cannot justify allowing her to stay in their home. She says she has not only betrayed a husband but betrayed all the girls who are legitimate in love. Mehwish arrives at Roomi school the next day and asks Hania if they can both talk. Asking if they plan on marrying, Hania refuses that she isn't doing so. She apologises for her earlier behaviour how she spoke to her. She tells how they married for love but she made a few mistakes and wasn't able to match his love. She admits her mistake but says mistakes happen but Hania says she doesn't just call it a mistake for a mother or wife. She says you have committed a sin even though Mehwish says men do the same. Hania says they don't have the right to make that mistake but a woman is a mother who bears children. Mehwish asks her for help but Hania says maybe her punishment has just begun and that her issue lies with God and forgiveness. Salman speaks to Danish and asks if he is willing to forgive Mehwish, he says he has forgiven her but that's all. He tells him that if you talk about past love, was it really love in the first place. Hania is talking to her sister about meeting Mehwish and how she suspects that both are to marry. Her sister says stay away from it all you want but one day he will ask you to marry so don't be stupid and say no. Mehwish finally calls Danish, she asks to meet him but he says he can't do this. He says if you come then you will need to eventually go again but she says hold on to me and don't let me leave. He says he did that last time but it didn't work. She is still crying as Danish says he remembers her all the time especially when someone talks about love with arrogance then puts the phone down on her. Salman and Aisha have a long discussion about them both and both agree that Danish has awoken from a love that there never was from Mehwish. Aisha tells him she has helped her move into a hostel. Roomi and Mehwish are speaking on the phone, she asks about if Hania and they both speak. Roomi says he will stay angry at her only until his dad does. He tells her about a time when Danish come home after she left and called out for her. Asking if she ever called out for him, Mehwish starts to cry. He explains the same to his dad about speaking to her, he asks if he will forgive her. Danish explains that it isn't easy for a child to understand about forgiveness and he will explain when he is older. Mehwish is seen walking to a darbar to pray, she cries as she remembers her past actions.\n\nMaham has come to meet Mehwish at the hostel. Maham wanted to be forgiven for the slap she gave but Mehwish says she is grateful that she got it, she awoke from a 5 month dream. Maham then offers her 2.5 crore for spending time with Shehwar that Mehwish did for free, Mehwish refuses this. Salman discusses a portfolio to Danish who does not appear to be happy. Danish says he lost Mehwish and he lost himself, money alone is not helping him. As Danish walks to his car, Ayesha jokes that why are you meeting Mehwish in the car park. Danish is unaware of this and does not go. Ayesha goes out to tell her to leave but she has already left but a note is on his car. She wrote that she wanted to picture how far ahead he has gone in life and how behind she is. Danish has come to meet Hania at her home, he says his intentions was to come and ask for her hand in marriage but has changed his mind. He says he won't ask as it will feel as if he is using her to get revenge. Hania jokes that next time it he asks she may say yes. Both Ayesha and Roomi receive a call that Mehwish has been taken into hospital after a suicide attempt. Danish arrives later at home and is told that Roomi is at the hospital with his mother. After waiting the night, Mehwish has awoke so Roomi goes to meet her. Danish asks Salman to handle the bill and any issues they may have and leaves without meeting her. Mehwish is happy to meet Roomi and asks if his father has come, he says he was here but has just left without coming to the room. Danish informs Hania that Roomi will be absent due to his mother being at the hospital. Ayesha and Salman discuss the issue and Salman says to correct a mistake Mehwish has committed a sin for which there is no forgiveness. Mehwish is discharged and both her and Roomi stay at the hostel. Roomi receives a call from Hania who speaks to Mehwish asking about her health. Mehwish jokes with her about Danish and her being his girlfriend to which surprises Hania. Ayesha and Salman arrive at Danish House and she says why is it so difficult for a man to forgive a woman. She says even though Mehwish tried killing herself she is still in hope that Danish will call for her one day. Danish says he is trying to forgive but even god doesn't forgive such a sin.\n\nRoomi asks his father over breakfast to meet his mother, he does not want to her die. Mehwish is seen purshasing the flat they shared using the money Maham gave her. She has his father's name engraved on a plaque outside and remembers the good times they shared. Monty arrives and asks if she is moving in yet and also with Danish but she says they have not had an argument to make up from.\nDanish is sat at his office when Ayesha comes in and tells him Mehwish has come to live with them two, he walks out and says don't justify betrayal. She repeats this to Mehwish who says she thought he would atleat have come seen her when she tried commuted suicide, Ayesha tells her don't rely on dying to make him come back. Hania and her sister discuss her potential love for her but Hania laughs it off. Roomi speaks to his mother and she asks to speak to Danish but he does not. Over dinner Danish asks Roomi to ring his mother. He discusses how mature Roomi has become and how he keeps asking about the divorce. She says why don't u consider moving me in the home and they can pretend as a family, Danish upset at this starts to cry and puts the phone down. Maham and Shehwar are seen to make up and she asks him to play the same tune on the piano he played for Mehwish. They both dance and she tells him that he is no longer the CEO and he will be back in his office. Danish arrives home after speaking to Ayesha about Roomi and how he is asking about Hania his teacher. Roomi tells him that he is going to meet Hania at her home, he rings her to find out and she says he said himself he will go. Roomi takes her hand and proposes on behalf of his father, she smiles and is shocked. When he is at home Danish and Roomi both laugh about what he has done, he says go ring your mother and tell her. Mehwish is seen unpacking and sees the black dress she wore when she left for Islamabad. She tears at the clothes as she is crying, ripping it in pieces.\n\nRoomi is having breakfast with his father and is impatient about not receiving a call from Hania regarding the proposal. Mehwish decides to move out from Salman and Ayesha home and back into the old flat, she says this must be her final punishment that she will forger remember Danish but he won't remember her. Hania comes to Danish House and discusses everything regarding the marriage proposal and leaves him a ring as per an engagement. She says if he agrees then wear it and let her know and goes away. \nMehwish arrives at the bare flat and is reminded by the memories she shared with both Roomi and Danish. She also remembers her actions towards him when she had decided to leave him for Shehwar. Monty sees her and comes to speak to her, she tries to get him to flirt with her like he did in the past but he says he is no longer that way due to his wife. Mehwish says she is happy to see this and asks him to bring her to meet sometime. Both Monty and his wife Ifra come with lunch to share with her and they sit and talk. Mehwish says to Ifra she knows that everyone is aware of her story. Ifra reassures her that Monty is regretful of his past attitude to her and counts her as a sister. Mehwish asks Monty to speak to Danish and try to convince him to meet her even if it is just for the final time. As Ayesha speaks to Danish about Mehwish moving to the flat, he is not happy about this. He is told by his secretary that Monty has come to meet him.

He works as a government 17th grade officer and earns Rs 65,000 monthly. His whole world revolves around his wife Mehwish ([[Ayeza Khan]]) and son Roomi. He loves them immensely. Even though he doesn't earn much, he tries to give them all the happiness in the world. On the other hand, Mehwish keeps coming up with wishes that she knows her husband will go to any extent to fulfil. Her desires are influenced by her best friend Anoushey ([[Mehar Bano]]), who keeps reminding Mehwish on how much she is missing out on in life just because she married Danish. Mehwish sees a Necklace at a mall and demands that Danish purchase it for her. Eager to please the love of his life, Danish decides to take the shortcut and use his position as a government officer to earn some extra cash via corruption. At first, Danish is afraid, but after witnessing how easily his boss gets away with bribery, Danish is now determined to take the risk to provide his family with all the luxuries. He gets a right start at this wrong path and finally buys the much-hyped necklace for Mehwish. However, when he arrives home, Danish finds out that Mehwish and Rumi have gone shopping with Mehwish's best friend, Anoushey. Where Mehwish is mature and understands the financial situation of her family, she is also under continuous peer pressure whenever she is with Anoushey. She borrows money from Anoushey to purchase the exact same necklace without knowing that Danish has already bought it for her. After indulging in shopping, Mehwish and Anoushey go to a restaurant for lunch, where we are introduced to Anoushey's brother's boss, Shehwar Ahmad ([[Adnan Siddiqui]]).\n\nShehwar Ahmed is a successful businessman and Anoushey's family friend. However, his marriage life is unsuccessful. His wife lives in the US due to their marital issues and Shehwar is free to flirt and date whomever he pleases. Shehwar and Mehwish meet for the first time at the restaurant and Shehwar couldn't help but praise Mehwish's beauty. She goes home and tells Danish about the necklace. Danish is disheartened, however, he does not tell Mehwish about the necklace that he bought. Instead, he gives Mehwish money to give back to Anoushey. Later that evening, Danish and Mehwish attend Anoushey's brother's Mehndi function, where Shehwar is also attending as a guest. Danish instantly notices Shehwar's lustful gaze on his wife and feels uncomfortable. Shehwar asks Mehwish for a dance. Mehwish is flattered but later politely declines. Danish sees the two talking and feels upset. He asks Mehwish to dance with him and she agrees after resisting at first. Shehwar asks Anoushey to go over and dance with Danish so that he could manipulate Mehwish into dancing with him. He uses this time to corrupt her thoughts by saying that a woman of her beauty and grace deserves much better than Danish. Danish sees Shehwar holding Mehwish close while dancing and is instantly furious. He tells Mehwish that they need to leave immediately and they head home without having eaten dinner. Once they reach home, Mehwish fights with Danish and asks him what is wrong with dancing. He tells her how disheartening it was for him to see another man holding his wife. He tells her that instead of being angry, she should feel ashamed. Mehwish feels insulted that her husband could be so insecure. Danish apologies and admits that his love for her makes him possessive and that he would go to any extent to keep Mehwish to himself. He also tells her that Mehwish should not worry about how others see her, but rather how her husband sees her.\n\nDanish leaves to bring food, as they left the event without eating. Frazzled by what happened at the Mehndi, Danish is almost hit by a car, whose driver turns out to be Shehwar. He senses Danish's unease and offers to give him a ride home. Danish refuses and returns home without the food and goes to sleep. The next day Mehwish and Roomi go shopping and accept a ride from their neighbour, Monty. Monty has eyes for Mehwish, but she doesn't see it that way. Danish is aware of this and does his best to protect his wife from the gaze of other men. Monty flirts with Mehwish in the car and tells her that she and Danish don't belong together. Danish finds out that Mehwish is in the car with Monty and leaves work to confront Monty. The two men get into an altercation. Danish arrives home bleeding and Mehwish argues that Danish is at fault, when Danish argues that Mehwish is blind to how men ogle at her and try to get close to her. Mehwish promises to be careful next time. Danish encourages Mehwish to attend Anoushey's brother's wedding without him, as he doesn't want to be seen with his bruised face, but much to Mehwish's surprise, he ends up attending the wedding and befriends Shehwar. Later, Shehwar drives them home and invites their family to his house for dinner, which they accept. The following day Shehwar calls Mehwish, saying that he has perhaps mistaken her number with Danish's and flirts with her, praising her beauty and her voice.\n\nDanish is offered a bribe of 10 lakh at work and is made to take the money home to think about it for a day or two.  Danish understands the weight of this decision \u2013 taking the money goes against his morals and those that he was taught by his father.  However, he also believes that he will never be able to afford the fine things in life or even the necessities if he does not venture on this path.  He discusses the situation with Mehwish, his emotional turmoil visible, but ultimately decides to take the bribe. Danish and Mehwish discuss their plans about the 10 lakhs that have come their way.  Planning on buying a new car, new clothes and so forth, Danish expresses his disbelief that this money belongs to him.  He goes so far as to approach Monty, despite their street brawl, and offers to buy his car.  While Monty does not believe him and asks where he got the money, insinuating that Mehwish is \"working,\" triggering Danish, who leaves in anger.  The next morning when Monty approaches him, he says he will not buy the car from him and asks him to leave. Mehwish, on the other hand, starts talking to Shehwaar on the phone on a daily basis when Danish leaves for the office.  Shehwar leaves no stone unturned to flirt with Mehwish and make her feel as though he only has eyes for her.\n\nAt work, Danish has a run-in with his boss when he is expected to sign off on paperwork that is unethical.  He returns the money, unable to compromise on his ethics. That night, the two (plus Roomi) visit Shahwaar for dinner, where Shahwaar takes any moment with Danish not in the room to flirt with Mehwish.  He has one on one discussions with her in the hall, telling her that any man would feel as though he needs nothing else if he had her. Later, before the two leave, Shehwar gifts Mehwish a necklace and asks Danish to put it on her. After returning home Danish begins to notice the change in his wife, pointing out that Mehwish used to complain when men leered at her and yet, she doesn't even notice Shehwar's inappropriate stares.  Mehwish brushes it off, but it's clear that she is taken in and impressed by Shehwar's wealth and charisma.  It also becomes clear that she enjoys the attention, something even Danish begins to realize.  While Danish works, Shehwar drops by his home and visits Mehwish (though he does not come in).  Their daily conversations continue, Shehwar becomes bold with his declarations towards Mehwish and offers Mehwish a job in his office with a monthly income of Rs 1 lakh.\n\nDanish arrives home and the watchman at the gate tells him that Shehwar came to the building, asking for Danish's apartment number. Danish confronts Mehwish and she denies it at first, then admits that she lied in fear of Danish's anger. Danish forgives her but insists that they return Shehwar's expensive gifts back to him. After Danish leaves to return the gifts, Mehwish calls Shehwar to give him a heads-up and Shehwar assures her that he can handle Danish. Once Danish arrives, Shehwar pacifies him by discussing his own loneliness and the joy he receives in their company. He sways Danish to the extent that Danish agrees to allow Mehwish to work for Shehwar.\n\nOnce at the office, Shehwar and Mehwish seem to begin their affair, something that they now have more freedom to carry out. Danish is the only one in this situation who is getting affected emotionally and physically. He is unable to focus on his work as he keeps thinking about Mehwish and Shehwar. He knows that he gave Mehwish permission to work for Shehwar, yet his heart is telling him that something wrong with his wife's boss is showering her with a new car, a driver and advanced salary. Mehwish is flying high thinking that's all she deserves. She starts comparing Shehwar with Danish and thinks about all the stuff she's missed out so far. Slowly, she begins \u2020o neglect her family and doesn't attend her son's first day of school. Shehwar insists that he cannot spend a day in the office without Mehwish's presence. Shehwar tricks Mehwish into attending a business trip with him to Islamabad. Mehwish does not tell Danish about the trip and believes she will be back home before Danish realises. She tells Danish that she needs to work late and Shehwar assures her that she will be back home before 9:00 pm. As luck would have it, their return flight gets delayed due to a storm and the audience sees a startled Mehwish, who is lying in bed at a hotel. She panics at first but Shehwar reassures her that they will get the next immediate flight out. They return at 10:30 instead of 9 pm, by which time Danish has discovered that Shehwar is in Islamabad. Sensing the worst, he rushes to the airport, and his fears are confirmed when he sees his wife and Shehwar arriving together. Danish takes Mehwish home on his bike and she asks him to stop so they can talk.\n\nShe asks him if he will beat her for lying to him, to which he replies that it was just a mistake and that there was nothing to worry about, even though he has tears running from his eyes. He realises what she has done but he forgives her, and simply prohibits her from returning to work the next day. The next day, Shehwar comes to the office and is surprised to hear that Mehwish has not come to work. After the airport incident, Danish tries his best to return to the way things were before but Mehwish is distracted with the thoughts of Shehwar. It is revealed through a flashback in the hotel room that Shehwar is influencing her thoughts and more directly pushing her to make the decision of choosing life with him. Mehwish knocks on his room and declares she is ready to \"get off at the next stop..\" confirming that she is more than considering leaving Danish.  This scene also implies that the relationship turned physical which Shehwar had planned it all along. After an evening out, Mehwish creates an argument with Danish, even though he tells her that he does not think bad of her and that he would like to move on from this incident. He swears at Shehwar and says he has ill intentions towards her boss. Mehwish immediately asks him to not swear at Shehwar and also that if Danish is over the incident then let her go back to the office which he refuses straight away. Mehwish declares that she is tired of their relationship and she wants nothing to do with Danish anymore. Danish seems to convince her the next day to calm down but as soon as he leaves for work she is on the phone to Shehwar. He asks her if she trusts him and that he will handle what needs to be done. He tells Mehwish to keep pushing separation from Danish and ask for a divorce.\n\nDanish borrow money from his boss and gathers the things gifted to Mehwish by Shehwar. As he is reaching Shehwar's office, Mehwish is on the phone and warns Shehwar in advance. Shehwar makes Danish wait in reception for a while as a show of authority. He tells Mehwish to pack her bags as he will ensure Danish divorces her tonight. Mehwish is concerned that he won't, but Shehwar tells her that Danish will divorce her. Danish is called in and tells him why he has come, he begins to return the advanced payment as well as the necklace. Shehwar starts to discuss the matter more directly and asks Danish why is he holding on to Mehwish if he can see that she wants to leave.\n\nTo further confirm this, he shows Danish the images of Mehwish in the hotel with him posing and wearing the infamous pink nighty. Danish is horrified and shocked, to add further the insult Shehwar also replays the recording of both speaking about he will convince Danish to divorce her. Danish visibly upset and speechless is then offered RS50 million to divorce her. Danish refuses the money and states that once a woman is bought, her value is worth nothing. Following an accident on his bike, Danish arrives home in bandages with the help of Monty. Mehwish shows no concern and Danish asks her to make a cup of tea. Shehwar calls Danish to ask him when he should come past their house to take Mehwish back with him. Danish says to come later in the evening, at a time when his son is asleep. Danish confronts Mehwish and tells her that he knows everything. He tells her that he went to Shehwar to save their love, but in the end, he barely managed to save their respect. He tells her that he saw the picture Shehwar took of her and that he can see that she is happy for once. She tells him to tell Roomi the truth after a few days as to not upset him if they ever cross paths randomly. Danish tells her to start packing but then asks if she is able to stay the night and leave in the morning instead when he is at work and their child is at school to which she agrees after consulting Shehwar. Mehwish asks Danish what deal he has done to for the divorce if he has taken money. Danish tells her he was offered the 50 million but refused it. He states that he never thought she would be sold so easy out on the street to which she states that he can do so much with that money. Danish says the money would never equal the peace and joy he had when he would come home from work to see her. Through a flashback at the office, Danish questions Shehwar about the thinking behind a woman who cheats. Also asking about how easy it was for Mehwish to visit the hotel with him, he tells Shehwar he has decided that he is letting go of Mehwish and he can collect her later that night. Shehwar is slightly confused about how direct and easy it was. Shehwar advises him to not hold on to a woman who is trying to leave as she has already left in her mind. This is repeated to Mehwish by Danish.\n\nSpeaking to Shehwar on the phone as Danish has gone for food, Mehwish discusses what has happened. Mehwish tells him that he has gone to get a cake to celebrate their wedding anniversary, Shehwar is amused and suggests that Danish has lost his mind. After bringing the food, he asks her to light the candles as he changes into clean clothes. Mehwish notices blood on her fingers which is Danish as his arm is bleeding, he cleans the wound himself. After lighting the candles he and her both blow the candles and Danish wishes her a long healthy life. Mehwish notices more blood on his arm and says she will bandage it but Danish refuses and says she has inflicted enough pain on him he can manage. Mehwish rings Shehwar again and explains what has happened then pleads with him to come collect her. Shehwar suggests he ask herself to which Danish laughs that he must he restless without her.He tells her he was the same when Shehwar took her to Islamabad for the night but at least she was her wife at the time. Danish tells her to ring him but as she is about to walk he away he says no need to go away and do it as there is no secrets between them anymore. He then hands her the divorce papers as she looks on with slight surprise. He starts to clean up but as she is trying to help him he tells her not to as he will be doing it from now on anyways. He tells her that he might be poor but he's not dirty. Shehwar arrives and is seated as Danish goes to make tea, Mehwish and him exchange glances as there is awkward silence. Danish makes the tea after Mehwish tries but says he never wants to drink from her hand ever again. Danish starts talking about how when they did love each other, he felt 6&nbsp;ft plus. Since this event he hasn't felt smaller as a person, he tells how the love of a woman can make a man feel invincible but when she's no longer interested the man feels turned away from God. Shehwar says times have changed and nowadays women do move on and regret the past and that they ever did love. He also further suggests a man should help pave the way such as Danish has done to help the woman move on. Danish says he has done exactly that by granting her divorce. Shehwar responds in glee that its great he has but Danish asks him to not call something like divorce great. He further embarrasses Shehwar by saying stealing from a broken home is not remotely great, Mehwish herself appears highly embarrassed. She says she will get things from her room but Danish forbids her and says her right for doing so was given away when he handed her the divorce papers. He goes and gets her luggage and says if they have finished their tea they can leave. Mehwish appears dejected and almost in a state of disbelief as she walks towards the door. As Danish and him shake hands, Danish says to Shehwar that he is surprised by looking at him as a businessman with all his charisma and told him he was an idiot to offer that much money for 2 but worthless woman. Mehwish is stunned hearing this and Shehwar is left speechless. They both make their way to the car as Danish lays next to Roomi with tears in his eyes. Shehwar and Mehwish look at each other in the car with only a slight smile, both still bemused as to what has happened.\n\nFew months have passed and Danish is sat with Mateen sahab discussing his intention to become a millionaire businessman, explaining how anything like loyalty, love and friendship can be bought. Danish also tells him how Roomi has slowly stopped asking about his mother and asked to be sent to a boarding school. He receives a letter from Roomi's headteachers asking for him to come in. As he is speaking to the headteacher she explains how Roomi is distant and failing in his grades. His teacher Ms Hania arrives and also states how she feels that he is not suited to the school as his classmates feel in danger from him. Danish explains something has happened which is the reason for his lack of interest and involvement. After both teachers agree to allow more time so Danish can speak to him, Ms Hania asks about his mother to which Danish angry states she has divorced him and left the country. Apologising for the outburst he explains that he will speak to Roomi and he will improve. Speaking to Roomi he explains how the loss is more for him and that she is still his mother. Roomi tells him that he does not want to he his fathers weakness and says if a mother leaves she isn't a mother either. At work Danish receives a promotion with a higher pay grade and is congratulated by Mateen. During lunch he explains how he is selling his apartment to start himself off in business and his intention to quit work so he can focus on business. Mateen sahab suggest that he does not rush into these things and for him to reconsider. At home Danish is upset after remembering how things used to be with Mehwish. She and Shehwar are both arriving back after a tour of Europe when she asks him when will they both marry. He laughs and responds that why spoil the good time they are having with thoughts of a lower class girl. He says they are both loving each other, if there is a need for marriage later they will. He then says that in marriage there is divorce but not when its love. Mehwish appears confused at this and slightly upset as Shehwar walks away. Danish meets Mateen sahab at a cafe where he says he has a buyer for his apartment. Mateen sahab again reiterates that he should hold on from quitting his job. He then tells him a time when he had a fall infront of his ex-wife who with her husband still.helped him. He asks her how she can still help him after the hurt he has given her she said to him that you feel sorry for the people who betray you, not hate. Mateen sahab upset at this then leaves where he has a heart attack in his car. Danish takes him to the hospital and calls his daughter from his mobile telling him what has happened. Sat waiting he see's Roomi teacher Ms Hania run into the hospital and realises she is Mateen sahab's daughter. The doctor comes to Danish and says he has passed away, Hania falls to the floor crying.\n\nDanish sits thinking about Mateen sahab and his last conversation as well as the funeral. The broker of the flat arrives and says he has been trying to contact him and that the buyer would like to make payment the next day. Danish asks him to delay it a few days with what has happened. Mehwish and Shehwar are sat having breakfast and she asks if he wouldn't mind Roomi coming to stay on the weekends to which he replies it's no problem. He tells her to call herself and arrange it then leaves for work. She calls and Hania answers, unaware that her late fathers and Danish phone was accidentally swapped. Mehwish asks for Danish and rudely speaks to her, Hania tells her to stop calling as it is not his number. She also receives a call from the broker who apologises for the mistake. Danish calls her and they realise that the phone was swapped so he says he will arrive shortly to drop it off. Just as he leaves the carpark, Mehwish arrives in a car after being advised by Shehwar to go herself and collect Roomi. The security for the apartments tells her she has just missed Danish, she says she will wait for him in the car. It is revealed that Danish has not told anyone about the divorce, instead just said that Mehwish and the kid are away due to work. She speaks to Shehwar who tells her that she should threaten legal action if Roomi isn't with her by the weekend. Danish sisters and speaks to Hania sharing memories about her father. She tells him Roomi has improved in class and that his education is her responsibility. She says to him that she is curious to meet his ex-wife, to see what a selfish unloving mother and wife looks like. Danish arrives and is shocked to see Mehwish in the car. She tries arguing in the carpark but he asks her into the flat as to not make a scene. He tells her he is happy for her to meet him etc but he will not allow him to go to Shehwar. He tells her he is at boarding and he is just about finally settled, if he says his mother with another man it will damage him. Mehwish ignores this and continues to argue that she will have him for the weekends. Danish again refuses so this time she threatens to take him to court where he will be disgraced. Danish snaps and shouts at her to get out. Speaking to a lawyer about his situation, he is advised against going to court due to the wealth and influence difference between him and Shehwar. He also says that a guy like Shehwar will not handle another man's child taking his attention away for too long so the situation will sort itself out rather than he lose in court. Shehwar receives a phone call and is told his shares have fallen. Already angry at this, he tells Mehwish that a threat alone is enough rather than go to court, he has no time to visit courts with her over this matter. He also says he only has weekends with her and won't if she has a child clung to her so she should just do day visits with him. He says to her he would rather her still look like a lover rather than a 50-year-old woman with a child to which Mehwish appears shocked. Mehwish arrives at the boarding school where Roomi hides when he sees her. Speaking to the headteacher she also meets Ms Hania. She then realises it was her that she spoke to on the phone. After saying she will be taking Roomi out, the head asks for a letter of permission from his father as this is the first time meeting his mother. Angry at this she says Roomi will meet her showing that she is indeed his mother but the head says rules are rules. They can meet but cannot leave the school premises. She either has to get a letter from Danish or a court order.\n\nFrustrated at not being able to take Roomi, she asks to meet him and Ms Hania goes to get him. Roomi refuses to meet her and says he does not want to see her anytime she comes. Mehwish is told this and explodes in anger, accusing the teachers of working with Danish against her. Hania tells her firmly that she needs to show respect to who she is talking to and that she only is repeating what Roomi told her, she cannot force him. Mehwish is then told by the head that she will not be allowed on the premises if she behaves in this manner. Hania calls Danish and tells him what has happened and tells him that a child should not be forced against his will. Danish then receives a call from Shehwar who gives him 2 days to ensure that Roomi meets his mum or else his lawyers will tear into him. Danish meets Roomi and tries to convince him to meet his mother or else he will face huge trouble from them, Roomi laughs and says to him that he is the weakness for him. These words take an effect on Danish who is conflicted about what to do. His mind is made up when he overhears a group of men who work for Shehwar, discussing the financial trouble and that he is spending all his money on a new girlfriend. He discusses his change of mind with both Hania and Roomi that he will be a man ot strength and character. After ringing Shehwar that he will discuss the matter face to face, Danish changes into a nice suit and cleans up his look. Arriving at the office, Shehwar has informed his secretary to keep him waiting for an hour but Danish expects this and walks in. Locking the door he approaches a surprised Shehwar and slaps him to the ground. Making his subordinates watch, Danish says he has come to discuss the matter as said before. Shehwar tries to threaten him and call the police but Danish slams him to the table and says he will do plenty of damage before the police come. Visibly scared, Shehwar pleads with him to let him go. Danish sits him down and says by the time his lawyers and goons get to him, he can disgrace Shehwar within minutes. He tells him you might have bought my ex-wife but don't ever threaten me over my son. Danish says if he does try to get between them again, he will strip him down infront of the rest of his employees. After telling Shehwar workers that they can use this incident to their advantage as he will be too embarrassed to say or do anything before walking out.\n\nDanish and Roomi are enjoying a day out at the zoo, they discuss how he beat Shehwar which makes Roomi happy and says how proud he is of him. He jokingly tells Danish to ask his teacher to marry him which Danish laughs off. Shehwar arrives at home and Mehwish is concerned as to why he is bleeding. After learning about the office incident she asks about what happened with the Roomi situation and Shehwar angrily tells her he wont meet her unless Roomi decides to himself. He shouts at her that because of his having to deal with situation he got beat up. She says don't hesitate on my behalf but Shehwar excuses it that if anything happens to Danish the suspicions will fall on them both. Roomi and Ms Hania sit and talk about him meeting his mother, she tries to convince him but Roomi falls silent then says he still does not want to. He blames Shehwar for what has happened but Hania quickly says it's his mothers fault, she then changes the subject. She asks why does your father not marry and Roomi tells her he himself has found a girl but he wont agree. Mehwish still angry at Shehwar, she argues that he claimed his threat meant something. He thinks back to Danish threatening him but tells her to speak to Danish himself. He says he can get him killed for 30,000 rupees in Karachi if he wanted but is hesitant because of her. He lies to her and says he wont forgive him for what happened but she has to try herself first. Danish is moving out of his apartment as some neighbour's discuss he is moving out because of his wife's betrayal. Danish meets them all to say goodbye and makes up with Monty due to their past differences, Monty apologises for his actions in the past. \nShehwar is informed that his shares have dropped further because of the 2 day strike at his chemical plant. During this he receives a call from Mehwish and angrily tells her to not disturb him. He tells his manager to increase the wages of staff to meet their demands and production to start immediately. Mehwish arrives at the apartment but is told Danish has sold up and left without telling anyone where he is going to. She rings and tells Shehwar who wrongly assumes Danish sold up because he was scared of him. Danish overhears the same group of men who work for Shehwar discussing the strike and the stock price drop. Shehwar sits drinking and is upset about the fall in profits from the strike and the wage increase. He says to her that they are both in a bad situation, his business and her not seeing her own son. She says she has left it in the hands of god but Shehwar mockingly tells her don't blame god for your own actions, he is never happy with a divorce seeking woman. He suggests they go to London for a week to which Mehwish says only after they marry, to avoid the conversation he says he is drunk and wants to sleep. Meanwhile, Danish speaks to an old university friend who works as a stock broker and asks to meet him. They meet in the morning and discuss how Danish wants to make money by investing his money, he finally tells him about what has happened with Mehwish. He is adamant to only buying Shehwar chemical shares, telling his friend that Mehwish has ran off with the CEO. At her home, Mehwish answers the telephone but nobody speaks. She tells Shehwar they received a call from the US and he tells her don't answer again if it rings. It does ring again but Mehwish walks away without answering. Danish has come to view an apartment to rent, costing over 1lakh a month which he puts down a deposit. His stock broker calls him and says his investment has paid off, the stock price of Shehwar chemicals has jumped but Danish is not surprised to hear this.\n\nHania and her friends arrive at a restaurant where she spots Danish alone. Whilst speaking to him, Mehwish arrives with Shehwar but do not notice him sat there. This upsets Danish who asks Hania to sit with him for a few minutes as he does not feel too good, he then leaves without eating. \nThe next day Danish is travelling with his estate agent to a car show room where he purchases a car. Receiving a call from the broker who advises him that share prices are good at the moment so he buys a small amount. Shehwar and Mehwish seem to have finalised getting a nikkah done as she refuses to meet him face to face until the ceremony is done. During a shopping trip she bumps into Anoushey and tells her what has happened during lunch. She is surprised at this and tells her if she knows that Shehwar defrauded his first wife and that the house belongs to her. Not bothered by this, Mehwish says once she arrives from the US it will all be sorted. Getting ready as a bride for the nikkah, there is a knock on the door. Maham ([[Savera Nadeem]]) walks in and slaps Mehwish and tells her that she is Shehwar Ahmed wife.\n\nWhilst driving, Danish is thinking about the past with Mehwish from how things used to be to when she said she wanted to leave him. He receives a call from Hania who scolds him for leaving Roomi alone. She says he needs a mother with him and for Danish to marry, he replied that the girl he is talking about is herself Hania so she quickly puts the phone down.\nShehwar gets arrested by the anti corruption and police squad, who inform him that the accuser is his wife Maham. He pleads with her to stop this as it is insulting, she replies that it's only just started. As he is led away Maham goes back to Mehwish who is sat crying. She asks her where is she from and if anything where does she belong right now. Ordering her to gather her stuff and leave Mehwish says she has nowhere to go to which Maham tells Dewan to give her money than she expects and to leave. She tells her she is lucky she wasn't arrested and that her punishment has already been given, the rest of her sentence will be out on the roads. Telling her that looking at her she is beautiful that she feels sorry for her but at the same time so ugly that she wanted to spit on her face. The driver takes her to the city centre but she asks if he could drop her off at her old apartment, he says even though they have moved out he will. Dewan and Maham discuss the matter, she asks if Mehwish was mistreated by her husband to which he says it appeared that he loved her so much he never raised his voice to her. Maham finds it hard to believe that a woman given so much love would act this way. Mehwish arrives at the apartment carpark and ask the guard to contact Danish, he says he does not no where he is and would not say even if he did. He tells her to leave the area as not many people know what happened as she would lose respect. The next day she meets Roomi at the school gates, she asks why did he not come see her and if his father had stopped him but he says it was his own choice. Asking if she could see him regular, he says maybe come once a month then leaves. The driver informs Danish that a woman come to meet Roomi and he confirms that it was his mother. Mehwish goes to the jail where Shehwar is held but he refuses to meet her as he is worried his wife will have him hung. He tells her to go back to her husband. Mehwish is further upset hearing this and says she agrees with his wife that she is from nowhere and a cheap woman. She calls Salman who feigns ignorance about the whole situation, she cries and says she needs help. He tells her to come to his house later. At their home, Danish meets Roomi who tells him about his mother. He says that she was crying and looked like she wanted to ask for forgiveness. Danish is told by Salman that Shehwar has been arrested on fraud charges.\n\nDanish does not comment on the Shehwar arrest and Salman tells this to Mehwish who has come to their home sitting with Aisha. He tells her he cannot offer a job at his workplace as Danish is his partner, he asks her to leave a current address and he will find her something. She asks if it's possible to stay the night with them to which he agrees but Aisha refuses. She says she has seen the hurt in Danish eyes and she cannot justify allowing her to stay in their home. She says she has not only betrayed a husband but betrayed all the girls who are legitimate in love. Mehwish arrives at Roomi school the next day and asks Hania if they can both talk. Asking if they plan on marrying, Hania refuses that she isn't doing so. She apologises for her earlier behaviour how she spoke to her. She tells how they married for love but she made a few mistakes and wasn't able to match his love. She admits her mistake but says mistakes happen but Hania says she doesn't just call it a mistake for a mother or wife. She says you have committed a sin even though Mehwish says men do the same. Hania says they don't have the right to make that mistake but a woman is a mother who bears children. Mehwish asks her for help but Hania says maybe her punishment has just begun and that her issue lies with God and forgiveness. Salman speaks to Danish and asks if he is willing to forgive Mehwish, he says he has forgiven her but that's all. He tells him that if you talk about past love, was it really love in the first place. Hania is talking to her sister about meeting Mehwish and how she suspects that both are to marry. Her sister says stay away from it all you want but one day he will ask you to marry so don't be stupid and say no. Mehwish finally calls Danish, she asks to meet him but he says he can't do this. He says if you come then you will need to eventually go again but she says hold on to me and don't let me leave. He says he did that last time but it didn't work. She is still crying as Danish says he remembers her all the time especially when someone talks about love with arrogance then puts the phone down on her. Salman and Aisha have a long discussion about them both and both agree that Danish has awoken from a love that there never was from Mehwish. Aisha tells him she has helped her move into a hostel. Roomi and Mehwish are speaking on the phone, she asks about if Hania and they both speak. Roomi says he will stay angry at her only until his dad does. He tells her about a time when Danish come home after she left and called out for her. Asking if she ever called out for him, Mehwish starts to cry. He explains the same to his dad about speaking to her, he asks if he will forgive her. Danish explains that it isn't easy for a child to understand about forgiveness and he will explain when he is older. Mehwish is seen walking to a darbar to pray, she cries as she remembers her past actions.\n\nMaham has come to meet Mehwish at the hostel. Maham wanted to be forgiven for the slap she gave but Mehwish says she is grateful that she got it, she awoke from a 5 month dream. Maham then offers her 2.5 crore for spending time with Shehwar that Mehwish did for free, Mehwish refuses this. Salman discusses a portfolio to Danish who does not appear to be happy. Danish says he lost Mehwish and he lost himself, money alone is not helping him. As Danish walks to his car, Ayesha jokes that why are you meeting Mehwish in the car park. Danish is unaware of this and does not go. Ayesha goes out to tell her to leave but she has already left but a note is on his car. She wrote that she wanted to picture how far ahead he has gone in life and how behind she is. Danish has come to meet Hania at her home, he says his intentions was to come and ask for her hand in marriage but has changed his mind. He says he won't ask as it will feel as if he is using her to get revenge. Hania jokes that next time it he asks she may say yes. Both Ayesha and Roomi receive a call that Mehwish has been taken into hospital after a suicide attempt. Danish arrives later at home and is told that Roomi is at the hospital with his mother. After waiting the night, Mehwish has awoke so Roomi goes to meet her. Danish asks Salman to handle the bill and any issues they may have and leaves without meeting her. Mehwish is happy to meet Roomi and asks if his father has come, he says he was here but has just left without coming to the room. Danish informs Hania that Roomi will be absent due to his mother being at the hospital. Ayesha and Salman discuss the issue and Salman says to correct a mistake Mehwish has committed a sin for which there is no forgiveness. Mehwish is discharged and both her and Roomi stay at the hostel. Roomi receives a call from Hania who speaks to Mehwish asking about her health. Mehwish jokes with her about Danish and her being his girlfriend to which surprises Hania. Ayesha and Salman arrive at Danish House and she says why is it so difficult for a man to forgive a woman. She says even though Mehwish tried killing herself she is still in hope that Danish will call for her one day. Danish says he is trying to forgive but even god doesn't forgive such a sin.\n\nRoomi asks his father over breakfast to meet his mother, he does not want to her die. Mehwish is seen purshasing the flat they shared using the money Maham gave her. She has his father's name engraved on a plaque outside and remembers the good times they shared. Monty arrives and asks if she is moving in yet and also with Danish but she says they have not had an argument to make up from.\nDanish is sat at his office when Ayesha comes in and tells him Mehwish has come to live with them two, he walks out and says don't justify betrayal. She repeats this to Mehwish who says she thought he would atleat have come seen her when she tried commuted suicide, Ayesha tells her don't rely on dying to make him come back. Hania and her sister discuss her potential love for her but Hania laughs it off. Roomi speaks to his mother and she asks to speak to Danish but he does not. Over dinner Danish asks Roomi to ring his mother. He discusses how mature Roomi has become and how he keeps asking about the divorce. She says why don't u consider moving me in the home and they can pretend as a family, Danish upset at this starts to cry and puts the phone down. Maham and Shehwar are seen to make up and she asks him to play the same tune on the piano he played for Mehwish. They both dance and she tells him that he is no longer the CEO and he will be back in his office. Danish arrives home after speaking to Ayesha about Roomi and how he is asking about Hania his teacher. Roomi tells him that he is going to meet Hania at her home, he rings her to find out and she says he said himself he will go. Roomi takes her hand and proposes on behalf of his father, she smiles and is shocked. When he is at home Danish and Roomi both laugh about what he has done, he says go ring your mother and tell her. Mehwish is seen unpacking and sees the black dress she wore when she left for Islamabad. She tears at the clothes as she is crying, ripping it in pieces.\n\nRoomi is having breakfast with his father and is impatient about not receiving a call from Hania regarding the proposal. Mehwish decides to move out from Salman and Ayesha home and back into the old flat, she says this must be her final punishment that she will forger remember Danish but he won't remember her. Hania comes to Danish House and discusses everything regarding the marriage proposal and leaves him a ring as per an engagement. She says if he agrees then wear it and let her know and goes away. \nMehwish arrives at the bare flat and is reminded by the memories she shared with both Roomi and Danish. She also remembers her actions towards him when she had decided to leave him for Shehwar. Monty sees her and comes to speak to her, she tries to get him to flirt with her like he did in the past but he says he is no longer that way due to his wife. Mehwish says she is happy to see this and asks him to bring her to meet sometime. Both Monty and his wife Ifra come with lunch to share with her and they sit and talk. Mehwish says to Ifra she knows that everyone is aware of her story. Ifra reassures her that Monty is regretful of his past attitude to her and counts her as a sister. Mehwish asks Monty to speak to Danish and try to convince him to meet her even if it is just for the final time. As Ayesha speaks to Danish about Mehwish moving to the flat, he is not happy about this. He is told by his secretary that Monty has come to meet him.

{"title_page": "High-definition video", "text_new": "{{About||high-definition video in broadcasting|High-definition television|other uses|High-definition (disambiguation){{!}}High-definition|other uses|HD (disambiguation){{!}}HD}}\n'''High-definition video''' ('''HDTV Video''' or '''[https://hdmovies.alx.com.pk/ HD] video''') is [[video]] of higher [[display resolution|resolution]] and quality than [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]]. While there is no standardized meaning for ''high-definition'', generally any video image with considerably more than 480 vertical [[Scan line|scan lines]] (North America) or 576 vertical lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly exceed that. Images of standard resolution captured at rates faster than normal (60 frames/second North America, 50 fps Europe), by a [[high-speed camera]] may be considered high-definition in some contexts. Some television series shot on high-definition video are made to look as if they have been shot on [[film camera|film]], a technique which is often known as [[filmizing]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first electronic scanning format, [[405-line television system|405 lines]], was the first \"high definition\" television system, since the mechanical systems it replaced had far fewer. From 1939, Europe and the US tried 605 and [[441-line television system|441 lines]] until, in 1941, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandated 525 for the US. In wartime France, Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy tested higher resolutions, up to 1,042. In late 1949, official French transmissions finally began with [[Analog high-definition television system#French 819-line .28737i.29 system|819]]. In 1984, however, this standard was abandoned for 625-line color on the [[TF1]] network.\n\n=== Analog ===\nModern HD specifications date to the early 1980s, when Japanese engineers developed the HighVision 1,125-line interlaced TV standard (also called [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]]) that ran at 60 frames per second. The [[Sony HDVS]] system was presented at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]], April 1981 and Japan's [[NHK]] presented its analog [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) system at a Swiss conference in 1983.\n\nThe NHK system was standardized in the United States as [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) standard #240M in the early 1990s, but abandoned later on when it was replaced by a DVB analog standard. HighVision video is still usable for HDTV video interchange, but there is almost no modern equipment available to perform this function. Attempts at implementing HighVision as a 6&nbsp;MHz broadcast channel were mostly unsuccessful. All attempts at using this format for terrestrial TV transmission were abandoned by the mid-1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nEurope developed [[HD-MAC]] (1,250 lines, 50&nbsp;Hz), a member of the [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|MAC]] family of hybrid analogue/digital video standards; however, it never took off as a terrestrial video transmission format. HD-MAC was never designated for video interchange except by the [[European Broadcasting Union]].\n\n=== Digital ===\nHigh-definition [[digital video]] was not possible with [[uncompressed video]] due to impractically high [[computer memory|memory]] and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] requirements, with a [[bit-rate]] exceeding 1{{nbsp}}[[Gbit/s]] for [[full HD]] video.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jack |title=Scalable Continuous Media Streaming Systems: Architecture, Design, Analysis and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780470857649 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fuvu52cyNEC&pg=PA25}}</ref> Digital [[HDTV]] was enabled by the development of [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) [[video compression]].<ref name=\"Shishikui\">{{cite journal |last1=Shishikui |first1=Yoshiaki |last2=Nakanishi |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Imaizumi |first3=Hiroyuki |title=An HDTV Coding Scheme using Adaptive-Dimension DCT |journal=Signal Processing of HDTV: Proceedings of the International Workshop on HDTV '93, Ottawa, Canada |date=October 26\u201328, 1993 |pages=611\u2013618 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-81844-7.50072-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9XSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA611 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9781483298511}}</ref> The DCT is a [[lossy compression]] technique that was first proposed by [[N.

In essence, the end of the 1980s was a death knell for most analog high definition technologies that had developed up to that time.\n\nThe FCC process, led by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] (ATSC) adopted a [[ATSC Standards|range of standards]] from interlaced 1,080-line video (a technical descendant of the original analog NHK 1125/30&nbsp;Hz system) with a maximum frame rate of 30&nbsp;Hz, (60 fields per second) and 720-line video, progressively scanned, with a maximum frame rate of 60&nbsp;Hz.\nIn the end, however, the [[Digital Video Broadcast|DVB]] standard of resolutions (1080, 720, 480) and respective frame rates (24, 25, 30) were adopted in conjunction with the Europeans that were also involved in the same standardization process. The FCC officially adopted the [[ATSC]] transmission standard in 1996 (which included both [[High-definition television|HD]] and [[Standard-definition television|SD video]] standards).\n\nIn the early 2000s, it looked as if DVB would be the video standard far into the future. However, both Brazil and China have adopted alternative standards for high-definition video{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that preclude the interoperability that was hoped for after decades of largely non-interoperable analog TV broadcasting.\n\n== Technical details ==\n[[Image:Vector Video Standards2.svg|thumb|This chart shows the most [[List of common resolutions|common display resolutions]], with the color of each resolution type indicating the display ratio (e.g., red indicates a 4:3 ratio) ]]\nHigh definition video (prerecorded and broadcast) is defined threefold, by:\n*''The number of lines in the vertical [[display resolution]]''. High-definition television (HDTV) resolution is 1,080 or 720 lines. In contrast, regular [[digital television]] (DTV) is 480 lines (upon which NTSC is based, 480 visible scanlines out of 525) or 576 lines (upon which PAL/SECAM are based, 576 visible scanlines out of 625). However, since HD is broadcast digitally, its introduction sometimes coincides with the introduction of DTV. Additionally, current DVD quality is not high-definition, although the high-definition disc systems [[Blu-ray]] Disc and the [[HD DVD]] are.\n*''The scanning system: [[progressive scan]]ning (p) or [[Interlaced video|interlaced scanning]] (i)''. ''Progressive scanning (p)'' redraws an image frame (all of its lines) when refreshing each image, for example 720p/1080p. ''Interlaced scanning (i)'' draws the image field every other line or \"odd-numbered\" lines during the first image refresh operation, and then draws the remaining \"even numbered\" lines during a second refreshing, for example 1080i. Interlaced scanning yields <!-- Why greater? In the case of 1080p and 1080i, the resolutions are the same. --> image resolution if subject is not moving, but loses up to half of the resolution and suffers \"combing\" artifacts when subject is moving.\n*''The number of frames or fields per second ([[Hertz|Hz]]). In Europe more common (50 Hz) television broadcasting system and in USA (60 Hz)''. The 720p60 format is 1,280&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;720 [[pixel]]s, progressive encoding with 60 frames per second (60&nbsp;Hz). The 1080i50/1080i60 format is 1920&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1080 pixels, interlaced encoding with 50/60 fields, (50/60 Hz) per second. Two interlaced fields formulate a single frame, because the two fields of one frame are temporally shifted. Frame [[telecine|pulldown]] and segmented frames are special techniques that allow transmitting full frames by means of interlaced video stream.\n\nOften, the rate is inferred from the context, usually assumed to be either 50 Hz (Europe) or 60 Hz (USA), except for [[1080p]], which denotes 1080p24, 1080p25, and 1080p30, but also 1080p50 and 1080p60.\n\nA [[Frame rate|frame]] or field rate can also be specified without a resolution. For example, 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second and 50i means 25 progressive frames per second, consisting of 50 interlaced fields per second. Most HDTV systems support some standard resolutions and frame or field rates. The most common are noted below.\nHigh-definition signals require a high-definition television or computer monitor in order to be viewed. High-definition video has an aspect ratio of 16:9 (1.78:1). The aspect ratio of regular widescreen film shot today is typically 1.85:1 or 2.39:1 (sometimes traditionally quoted at 2.35:1). Standard-definition television (SDTV) has a 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio, although in recent years many broadcasters have transmitted programs \"squeezed\" horizontally in 16:9 [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic format]], in hopes that the viewer has a 16:9 set which stretches the image out to normal-looking proportions, or a set which \"squishes\" the image vertically to present a \"letterbox\" view of the image, again with correct proportions.\n\n=== Common high-definition video modes ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 80%;\"\n|- align=left\n!

Digital Versatile Discs or DVDs (that hold 4.7 [[Gigabyte|GB]] for a Single layer or 8.5 GB for a double layer), are not always up to the challenge of today's high-definition (HD) sets. Storing and playing HD movies requires a disc that holds more information, like a Blu-ray Disc (which hold 25 GB in single layer form and 50 GB for double layer) or the now-defunct High Definition Digital Versatile Discs (HD DVDs) which held 15 GB or 30 GB in, respectively, single and double layer variations.\n\nBlu-ray Discs were jointly developed by 9 initial partners including Sony and Phillips (which jointly developed CDs for audio), and Pioneer (which developed its own Laser-disc previously with some success) among others. HD-DVD discs were primarily developed by Toshiba and NEC with some backing from Microsoft, Warner Bros., Hewlett Packard, and others. On February 19, 2008 Toshiba announced it was abandoning the format and would discontinue development, marketing and manufacturing of HD-DVD players and drives.\n\n=== Types of recorded media ===\nThe high resolution [[photographic film]] used for cinema projection is exposed at the rate of 24 frames per second but usually projected at 48, each frame getting projected twice helping to minimise flicker. One exception to this was the 1986 [[National Film Board of Canada]] short film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]'', which briefly experimented with both filming and projecting at 48 frame/s, in a process known as [[IMAX#HD|IMAX HD]].\n\nDepending upon available bandwidth and the amount of detail and movement in the image, the optimum format for video transfer is either 720p24 or 1080p24. When shown on television in PAL system countries, film must be projected at the rate of 25 frames per second by accelerating it by 4.1 percent. In NTSC standard countries, the projection rate is 30 frames per second, using a technique called 3:2 pull-down. One film frame is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second), and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second) and then the process is repeated, thus achieving the correct film projection rate with two film frames shown in one twelfth of a second. {{See also|Telecine|Deinterlacing}}\n\nOlder (pre-HDTV) recordings on video tape such as [[Betacam]] SP are often either in the form 480i60 or 576i50. These may be upconverted to a higher resolution format, but removing the interlace to match the common [[720p]] format may distort the picture or require filtering which actually reduces the resolution of the final output.\n\nNon-cinematic HDTV video recordings are recorded in either the 720p or the [[1080i]] format. The format used is set by the broadcaster (if for television broadcast). In general, 720p is more accurate with fast action, because it progressively scans frames, instead of the 1080i, which uses interlaced fields and thus might degrade the resolution of fast images.\n\n720p is used more for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because computer monitors progressively scan; 720p video has lower storage-decoding requirements than either the 1080i or the 1080p. This is also the medium for high-definition broadcasts around the world and 1080p is used for [[Blu-ray]] movies.\n\n=== HD in filmmaking ===\nFilm as a medium has inherent limitations, such as difficulty of viewing footage while recording, and suffers other problems, caused by poor film development/processing, or poor monitoring systems. Given that there is increasing use of computer-generated or computer-altered imagery in movies, and that editing picture sequences is often done digitally, some directors have shot their movies using the HD format via high-end digital video cameras. While the quality of HD video is very high compared to SD video, and offers improved signal/noise ratios against comparable sensitivity film, film remains able to resolve more image detail than current HD video formats. In addition some films have a wider dynamic range (ability to resolve extremes of dark and light areas in a scene) than even the best HD cameras. Thus the most persuasive arguments for the use of HD are currently cost savings on film stock and the ease of transfer to editing systems for special effects.\n\nDepending on the year and format in which a movie was filmed, the exposed image can vary greatly in size. Sizes range from as big as 24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm for [[VistaVision]]/[[Technirama]] 8 perforation cameras (same as 35&nbsp;mm still photo film) going down through 18&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;24&nbsp;mm for Silent Films or Full Frame 4 perforations cameras to as small as 9&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;21&nbsp;mm in Academy Sound Aperture cameras modified for the Techniscope 2 perforation format. Movies are also produced using other [[film gauge]]s, including [[70 mm film]]s (22&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;48&nbsp;mm) or the rarely used 55&nbsp;mm and [[Cinerama|CINERAMA]].\n\nThe four major [[List of film formats|film formats]] provide pixel resolutions (calculated from pixels per millimeter) roughly as follows:\n\n*Academy Sound (Sound movies before 1955): 15&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (1.375) = 2,160&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2,970\n*Academy camera US Widescreen: 11&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (1.85) = 1,605 \u00d7 2,970\n*Current Anamorphic Panavision (\"Scope\"): 17.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (2.39) = 2,485&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2,970\n*Super-35 for Anamorphic prints: 10&nbsp;mm \u00d7 24&nbsp;mm (2.39) = 1,420&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3,390\n\nIn the process of making prints for exhibition, this negative is copied onto other film (negative \u2192 interpositive \u2192 internegative \u2192 print) causing the resolution to be reduced with each emulsion copying step and when the image passes through a lens (for example, on a projector).

The need for high resolution, color fidelity, and frame rate is acute for surveillance purposes to ensure that the quality of the video output is of an acceptable standard that can be used both for preventative surveillance as well as for evidence purposes. These needs, however, must be balanced against the additional storage capacity required by HD video.\n\n=== HD in video gaming ===\nBoth the [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]] and [[Xbox 360]] can output native 1080p through [[HDMI]] or component cables, but the systems have few games which appear in 1080p; most games only run natively at 720p or less, but can be upscaled to 1080p. The [[Wii]] can output up to 480p ([[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]]) over component, which while not HD, is very useful for HDTVs as it avoids de-interlacing artifacts. The Wii can also output 576i and 576p in [[PAL]] regions.\n\nVisually, native 1080p produces a sharper and clearer picture compared to upscaled 1080p. Though only a handful of games available have the [[native resolution]] of 1080p, all games on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 can be upscaled up to this resolution. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games are labeled with the output resolution on the back of their packaging, although on Xbox 360 this indicates the resolution it will upscale to, not the native resolution of the game.\n\nGenerally, [[Personal computer game|PC games]] are only limited by the display's resolution size. Drivers are capable of supporting very high resolutions, depending on the chipset of the video card. Many game engines support resolutions of 5760\u00d71080 or 5760\u00d71200 (typically achieved with three 1080p displays in a [[multi-monitor]] setup) and nearly all will display 1080p at minimum. 1440p and 4K are typically supported resolutions for PC gaming as well.\n\nCurrently all consoles, Nintendo's [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], Microsoft's [[Xbox One]], and Sony's [[PlayStation 4]] display games 1080p natively. The Nintendo Switch is an unusual case, due to its hybrid nature as both a home console and a handheld: the built-in screen displays games at 720p maximum, but the console can natively display imagery at 1080p when docked. PlayStation 4 is able to display in 4K, though strictly only for displaying pictures.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ATSC tuner]]\n* [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB)\n* [[DTV channel protection ratios]]\n* [[HD ready]]\n* HDTV input and colorspace ([[YPbPr]] / [[YCbCr]])\n* [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting]]\n* [[Federal Standard 1037C|United States Federal Standard 1037C]]\n* [[Waveform monitor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_299-ive.pdf |title=Images formats for HDTV }}&nbsp;{{small|(549&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, article from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] Technical Review .\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_300-wood.pdf |title=High Definition for Europe - a progressive approach }}&nbsp;{{small|(207&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, article from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] Technical Review .\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3299.pdf |title=High Definition (HD) Image Formats for Television Production }}&nbsp;{{small|(117&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, technical report from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3312.pdf |title=Digital Terrestrial HDTV Broadcasting in Europe }}, technical report from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|HDTV}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060218161605/http://www.atsc.org/guide_default.html ATSC]\n\n{{High-definition}}\n{{Video storage formats}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High-Definition Video}}\n[[Category:Blu-ray Disc]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Digital television]]\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:High-definition television]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||high-definition video in broadcasting|High-definition television|other uses|High-definition (disambiguation){{!}}High-definition|other uses|HD (disambiguation){{!}}HD}}\n'''High-definition video''' ('''HDTV Video''' or '''HD video''') is [[video]] of higher [[display resolution|resolution]] and quality than [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]]. While there is no standardized meaning for ''high-definition'', generally any video image with considerably more than 480 vertical [[Scan line|scan lines]] (North America) or 576 vertical lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly exceed that. Images of standard resolution captured at rates faster than normal (60 frames/second North America, 50 fps Europe), by a [[high-speed camera]] may be considered high-definition in some contexts. Some television series shot on high-definition video are made to look as if they have been shot on [[film camera|film]], a technique which is often known as [[filmizing]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first electronic scanning format, [[405-line television system|405 lines]], was the first \"high definition\" television system, since the mechanical systems it replaced had far fewer. From 1939, Europe and the US tried 605 and [[441-line television system|441 lines]] until, in 1941, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandated 525 for the US. In wartime France, Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy tested higher resolutions, up to 1,042. In late 1949, official French transmissions finally began with [[Analog high-definition television system#French 819-line .28737i.29 system|819]]. In 1984, however, this standard was abandoned for 625-line color on the [[TF1]] network.\n\n=== Analog ===\nModern HD specifications date to the early 1980s, when Japanese engineers developed the HighVision 1,125-line interlaced TV standard (also called [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]]) that ran at 60 frames per second. The [[Sony HDVS]] system was presented at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]], April 1981 and Japan's [[NHK]] presented its analog [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) system at a Swiss conference in 1983.\n\nThe NHK system was standardized in the United States as [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) standard #240M in the early 1990s, but abandoned later on when it was replaced by a DVB analog standard. HighVision video is still usable for HDTV video interchange, but there is almost no modern equipment available to perform this function. Attempts at implementing HighVision as a 6&nbsp;MHz broadcast channel were mostly unsuccessful. All attempts at using this format for terrestrial TV transmission were abandoned by the mid-1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nEurope developed [[HD-MAC]] (1,250 lines, 50&nbsp;Hz), a member of the [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|MAC]] family of hybrid analogue/digital video standards; however, it never took off as a terrestrial video transmission format. HD-MAC was never designated for video interchange except by the [[European Broadcasting Union]].\n\n=== Digital ===\nHigh-definition [[digital video]] was not possible with [[uncompressed video]] due to impractically high [[computer memory|memory]] and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] requirements, with a [[bit-rate]] exceeding 1{{nbsp}}[[Gbit/s]] for [[full HD]] video.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jack |title=Scalable Continuous Media Streaming Systems: Architecture, Design, Analysis and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780470857649 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fuvu52cyNEC&pg=PA25}}</ref> Digital [[HDTV]] was enabled by the development of [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) [[video compression]].<ref name=\"Shishikui\">{{cite journal |last1=Shishikui |first1=Yoshiaki |last2=Nakanishi |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Imaizumi |first3=Hiroyuki |title=An HDTV Coding Scheme using Adaptive-Dimension DCT |journal=Signal Processing of HDTV: Proceedings of the International Workshop on HDTV '93, Ottawa, Canada |date=October 26\u201328, 1993 |pages=611\u2013618 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-81844-7.50072-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9XSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA611 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9781483298511}}</ref> The DCT is a [[lossy compression]] technique that was first proposed by [[N.

In essence, the end of the 1980s was a death knell for most analog high definition technologies that had developed up to that time.\n\nThe FCC process, led by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] (ATSC) adopted a [[ATSC Standards|range of standards]] from interlaced 1,080-line video (a technical descendant of the original analog NHK 1125/30&nbsp;Hz system) with a maximum frame rate of 30&nbsp;Hz, (60 fields per second) and 720-line video, progressively scanned, with a maximum frame rate of 60&nbsp;Hz.\nIn the end, however, the [[Digital Video Broadcast|DVB]] standard of resolutions (1080, 720, 480) and respective frame rates (24, 25, 30) were adopted in conjunction with the Europeans that were also involved in the same standardization process. The FCC officially adopted the [[ATSC]] transmission standard in 1996 (which included both [[High-definition television|HD]] and [[Standard-definition television|SD video]] standards).\n\nIn the early 2000s, it looked as if DVB would be the video standard far into the future. However, both Brazil and China have adopted alternative standards for high-definition video{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that preclude the interoperability that was hoped for after decades of largely non-interoperable analog TV broadcasting.\n\n== Technical details ==\n[[Image:Vector Video Standards2.svg|thumb|This chart shows the most [[List of common resolutions|common display resolutions]], with the color of each resolution type indicating the display ratio (e.g., red indicates a 4:3 ratio) ]]\nHigh definition video (prerecorded and broadcast) is defined threefold, by:\n*''The number of lines in the vertical [[display resolution]]''. High-definition television (HDTV) resolution is 1,080 or 720 lines. In contrast, regular [[digital television]] (DTV) is 480 lines (upon which NTSC is based, 480 visible scanlines out of 525) or 576 lines (upon which PAL/SECAM are based, 576 visible scanlines out of 625). However, since HD is broadcast digitally, its introduction sometimes coincides with the introduction of DTV. Additionally, current DVD quality is not high-definition, although the high-definition disc systems [[Blu-ray]] Disc and the [[HD DVD]] are.\n*''The scanning system: [[progressive scan]]ning (p) or [[Interlaced video|interlaced scanning]] (i)''. ''Progressive scanning (p)'' redraws an image frame (all of its lines) when refreshing each image, for example 720p/1080p. ''Interlaced scanning (i)'' draws the image field every other line or \"odd-numbered\" lines during the first image refresh operation, and then draws the remaining \"even numbered\" lines during a second refreshing, for example 1080i. Interlaced scanning yields <!-- Why greater? In the case of 1080p and 1080i, the resolutions are the same. --> image resolution if subject is not moving, but loses up to half of the resolution and suffers \"combing\" artifacts when subject is moving.\n*''The number of frames or fields per second ([[Hertz|Hz]]). In Europe more common (50 Hz) television broadcasting system and in USA (60 Hz)''. The 720p60 format is 1,280&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;720 [[pixel]]s, progressive encoding with 60 frames per second (60&nbsp;Hz). The 1080i50/1080i60 format is 1920&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1080 pixels, interlaced encoding with 50/60 fields, (50/60 Hz) per second. Two interlaced fields formulate a single frame, because the two fields of one frame are temporally shifted. Frame [[telecine|pulldown]] and segmented frames are special techniques that allow transmitting full frames by means of interlaced video stream.\n\nOften, the rate is inferred from the context, usually assumed to be either 50 Hz (Europe) or 60 Hz (USA), except for [[1080p]], which denotes 1080p24, 1080p25, and 1080p30, but also 1080p50 and 1080p60.\n\nA [[Frame rate|frame]] or field rate can also be specified without a resolution. For example, 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second and 50i means 25 progressive frames per second, consisting of 50 interlaced fields per second. Most HDTV systems support some standard resolutions and frame or field rates. The most common are noted below.\nHigh-definition signals require a high-definition television or computer monitor in order to be viewed. High-definition video has an aspect ratio of 16:9 (1.78:1). The aspect ratio of regular widescreen film shot today is typically 1.85:1 or 2.39:1 (sometimes traditionally quoted at 2.35:1). Standard-definition television (SDTV) has a 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio, although in recent years many broadcasters have transmitted programs \"squeezed\" horizontally in 16:9 [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic format]], in hopes that the viewer has a 16:9 set which stretches the image out to normal-looking proportions, or a set which \"squishes\" the image vertically to present a \"letterbox\" view of the image, again with correct proportions.\n\n=== Common high-definition video modes ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 80%;\"\n|- align=left\n!

Digital Versatile Discs or DVDs (that hold 4.7 [[Gigabyte|GB]] for a Single layer or 8.5 GB for a double layer), are not always up to the challenge of today's high-definition (HD) sets. Storing and playing HD movies requires a disc that holds more information, like a Blu-ray Disc (which hold 25 GB in single layer form and 50 GB for double layer) or the now-defunct High Definition Digital Versatile Discs (HD DVDs) which held 15 GB or 30 GB in, respectively, single and double layer variations.\n\nBlu-ray Discs were jointly developed by 9 initial partners including Sony and Phillips (which jointly developed CDs for audio), and Pioneer (which developed its own Laser-disc previously with some success) among others. HD-DVD discs were primarily developed by Toshiba and NEC with some backing from Microsoft, Warner Bros., Hewlett Packard, and others. On February 19, 2008 Toshiba announced it was abandoning the format and would discontinue development, marketing and manufacturing of HD-DVD players and drives.\n\n=== Types of recorded media ===\nThe high resolution [[photographic film]] used for cinema projection is exposed at the rate of 24 frames per second but usually projected at 48, each frame getting projected twice helping to minimise flicker. One exception to this was the 1986 [[National Film Board of Canada]] short film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]'', which briefly experimented with both filming and projecting at 48 frame/s, in a process known as [[IMAX#HD|IMAX HD]].\n\nDepending upon available bandwidth and the amount of detail and movement in the image, the optimum format for video transfer is either 720p24 or 1080p24. When shown on television in PAL system countries, film must be projected at the rate of 25 frames per second by accelerating it by 4.1 percent. In NTSC standard countries, the projection rate is 30 frames per second, using a technique called 3:2 pull-down. One film frame is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second), and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second) and then the process is repeated, thus achieving the correct film projection rate with two film frames shown in one twelfth of a second. {{See also|Telecine|Deinterlacing}}\n\nOlder (pre-HDTV) recordings on video tape such as [[Betacam]] SP are often either in the form 480i60 or 576i50. These may be upconverted to a higher resolution format, but removing the interlace to match the common [[720p]] format may distort the picture or require filtering which actually reduces the resolution of the final output.\n\nNon-cinematic HDTV video recordings are recorded in either the 720p or the [[1080i]] format. The format used is set by the broadcaster (if for television broadcast). In general, 720p is more accurate with fast action, because it progressively scans frames, instead of the 1080i, which uses interlaced fields and thus might degrade the resolution of fast images.\n\n720p is used more for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because computer monitors progressively scan; 720p video has lower storage-decoding requirements than either the 1080i or the 1080p. This is also the medium for high-definition broadcasts around the world and 1080p is used for [[Blu-ray]] movies.\n\n=== HD in filmmaking ===\nFilm as a medium has inherent limitations, such as difficulty of viewing footage while recording, and suffers other problems, caused by poor film development/processing, or poor monitoring systems. Given that there is increasing use of computer-generated or computer-altered imagery in movies, and that editing picture sequences is often done digitally, some directors have shot their movies using the HD format via high-end digital video cameras. While the quality of HD video is very high compared to SD video, and offers improved signal/noise ratios against comparable sensitivity film, film remains able to resolve more image detail than current HD video formats. In addition some films have a wider dynamic range (ability to resolve extremes of dark and light areas in a scene) than even the best HD cameras. Thus the most persuasive arguments for the use of HD are currently cost savings on film stock and the ease of transfer to editing systems for special effects.\n\nDepending on the year and format in which a movie was filmed, the exposed image can vary greatly in size. Sizes range from as big as 24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm for [[VistaVision]]/[[Technirama]] 8 perforation cameras (same as 35&nbsp;mm still photo film) going down through 18&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;24&nbsp;mm for Silent Films or Full Frame 4 perforations cameras to as small as 9&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;21&nbsp;mm in Academy Sound Aperture cameras modified for the Techniscope 2 perforation format. Movies are also produced using other [[film gauge]]s, including [[70 mm film]]s (22&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;48&nbsp;mm) or the rarely used 55&nbsp;mm and [[Cinerama|CINERAMA]].\n\nThe four major [[List of film formats|film formats]] provide pixel resolutions (calculated from pixels per millimeter) roughly as follows:\n\n*Academy Sound (Sound movies before 1955): 15&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (1.375) = 2,160&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2,970\n*Academy camera US Widescreen: 11&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (1.85) = 1,605 \u00d7 2,970\n*Current Anamorphic Panavision (\"Scope\"): 17.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 21&nbsp;mm (2.39) = 2,485&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2,970\n*Super-35 for Anamorphic prints: 10&nbsp;mm \u00d7 24&nbsp;mm (2.39) = 1,420&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3,390\n\nIn the process of making prints for exhibition, this negative is copied onto other film (negative \u2192 interpositive \u2192 internegative \u2192 print) causing the resolution to be reduced with each emulsion copying step and when the image passes through a lens (for example, on a projector). In many cases, the resolution can be reduced down to 1/6 of the original negative's resolution (or worse).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Note that resolution values for 70&nbsp;mm film are higher than those listed above.\n\n=== HD on the World Wide Web/HD streaming ===\nA number of online video streaming/on demand and digital download services offer HD video, among them [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], [[dailymotion]], [[Prime Video|Amazon Video On Demand]], [[Netflix#Watch Instantly|Netflix Watch Instantly]], and others. Due to heavy compression, the image detail produced by these formats is far below that of broadcast HD, and often even inferior to [[DVD-Video]] (3-9&nbsp;Mbit/s MP2) [[video scaler|upscaled]] to the same image size.<ref name=\"fake HD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/why-hd-movie-downloads-are-a-big-lie/511|title=Why HD movie downloads are a big lie|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=Ziff-Davis}}</ref> The following is a chart of numerous online services and their HD offering:\n\n==== World Wide Web HD resolutions ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 90%;\"\n|- align=left\n!

The need for high resolution, color fidelity, and frame rate is acute for surveillance purposes to ensure that the quality of the video output is of an acceptable standard that can be used both for preventative surveillance as well as for evidence purposes. These needs, however, must be balanced against the additional storage capacity required by HD video.\n\n=== HD in video gaming ===\nBoth the [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]] and [[Xbox 360]] can output native 1080p through [[HDMI]] or component cables, but the systems have few games which appear in 1080p; most games only run natively at 720p or less, but can be upscaled to 1080p. The [[Wii]] can output up to 480p ([[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]]) over component, which while not HD, is very useful for HDTVs as it avoids de-interlacing artifacts. The Wii can also output 576i and 576p in [[PAL]] regions.\n\nVisually, native 1080p produces a sharper and clearer picture compared to upscaled 1080p. Though only a handful of games available have the [[native resolution]] of 1080p, all games on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 can be upscaled up to this resolution. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games are labeled with the output resolution on the back of their packaging, although on Xbox 360 this indicates the resolution it will upscale to, not the native resolution of the game.\n\nGenerally, [[Personal computer game|PC games]] are only limited by the display's resolution size. Drivers are capable of supporting very high resolutions, depending on the chipset of the video card. Many game engines support resolutions of 5760\u00d71080 or 5760\u00d71200 (typically achieved with three 1080p displays in a [[multi-monitor]] setup) and nearly all will display 1080p at minimum. 1440p and 4K are typically supported resolutions for PC gaming as well.\n\nCurrently all consoles, Nintendo's [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], Microsoft's [[Xbox One]], and Sony's [[PlayStation 4]] display games 1080p natively. The Nintendo Switch is an unusual case, due to its hybrid nature as both a home console and a handheld: the built-in screen displays games at 720p maximum, but the console can natively display imagery at 1080p when docked. PlayStation 4 is able to display in 4K, though strictly only for displaying pictures.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ATSC tuner]]\n* [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB)\n* [[DTV channel protection ratios]]\n* [[HD ready]]\n* HDTV input and colorspace ([[YPbPr]] / [[YCbCr]])\n* [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting]]\n* [[Federal Standard 1037C|United States Federal Standard 1037C]]\n* [[Waveform monitor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_299-ive.pdf |title=Images formats for HDTV }}&nbsp;{{small|(549&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, article from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] Technical Review .\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_300-wood.pdf |title=High Definition for Europe - a progressive approach }}&nbsp;{{small|(207&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, article from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] Technical Review .\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3299.pdf |title=High Definition (HD) Image Formats for Television Production }}&nbsp;{{small|(117&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, technical report from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]\n* {{cite web|url= http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3312.pdf |title=Digital Terrestrial HDTV Broadcasting in Europe }}, technical report from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|HDTV}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060218161605/http://www.atsc.org/guide_default.html ATSC]\n\n{{High-definition}}\n{{Video storage formats}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High-Definition Video}}\n[[Category:Blu-ray Disc]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Digital television]]\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:High-definition television]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n", "name_user": "119.157.72.235", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video"}

The first expedition was more a reconnaissance than a full invasion and gained a foothold on the coast of [[Kent]] but was unable to advance further because of storm damage to the ships and a lack of cavalry. Despite the military failure it was a political success, with the [[Roman Senate]] declaring a 20-day public holiday in Rome to honour the unprecedented achievement of obtaining hostages from Britain and defeating Belgian tribes on returning to the continent.<ref>{{citation |author=Julius Caesar |title=''Commentarii de Bello Gallico''  |language=la|at=[[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#20|IV 20\u201336]] }}</ref>\n\nThe second invasion involved a substantially larger force and Caesar coerced or invited many of the native Celtic tribes to pay tribute and give hostages in return for peace. A friendly local king, [[Mandubracius]], was installed, and his rival, [[Cassivellaunus]], was brought to terms.

The British leader sought refuge among the Brigantes, but their queen, [[Cartimandua]], proved her loyalty by surrendering him to the Romans. He was brought as a captive to Rome, where a dignified speech he made during Claudius's triumph persuaded the emperor to spare his life. The Silures were still not pacified, and Cartimandua's ex-husband [[Venutius]] replaced Caratacus as the most prominent leader of British resistance.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31\u201338] }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Nero]]'s accession Roman Britain extended as far north as [[Lindum Colonia|Lindum]]. [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the conqueror of [[Mauretania]] (modern day [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]]), then became governor of Britain, and in 60 and 61 he moved against Mona ([[Anglesey]]) to settle accounts with [[Druid]]ism once and for all. Paulinus led his army across the [[Menai Strait]] and massacred the Druids and burnt their sacred groves.\n\nWhile Paulinus was [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|campaigning in Mona]], the southeast of Britain rose in revolt under the leadership of [[Boudica]]. Boudica was the widow of the recently deceased king of the Iceni, Prasutagus. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Prasutagus had left a will leaving half his kingdom to Nero in the hope that the remainder would be left untouched. He was wrong. When his will was enforced, Rome responded by violently seizing the tribe's lands in full. Boudica protested. In consequence, Rome punished her and her daughters by flogging and rape. In response, the Iceni, joined by the [[Trinovantes]], destroyed the Roman colony at Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]) and [[Battle of Camulodunum|routed]] the part of the IXth Legion that was sent to relieve it. Paulinus rode to [[London]] (then called [[Londinium]]), the rebels' next target, but concluded it could not be defended. Abandoned, it was destroyed, as was [[Verulamium]] (St. Albans). Between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed in the three cities. But Paulinus regrouped with two of the three legions still available to him, chose a battlefield, and, despite being outnumbered by more than twenty to one, defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Watling Street]].

The Romans had previously defended Cartimandua against him, but this time were unable to do so. Cartimandua was evacuated, and Venutius was left in control of the north of the country.

Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], father-in-law to the historian [[Tacitus]], conquered the [[Ordovices]] in 78.

This required that the emperor station a trusted senior man as governor of the province. As a result, many future emperors served as governors or legates in this province, including [[Vespasian]], [[Pertinax]], and [[Gordian I]].\n{{Gallery\n|title  = Roman military organisation in the north\n|align  = right\n|width  = 180\n|height = 180\n|lines  = 2\n|File:Roman.Scotland.north.84.jpg|In 84 AD\n|File:Roman.Scotland.north.155.jpg|In 155 AD\n}}\n\n=== Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland ===\nThere is no historical source describing the decades that followed Agricola's recall. Even the name of his replacement is unknown. Archaeology has shown that some [[Castra|Roman forts]] south of the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus were rebuilt and enlarged; others appear to have been abandoned. Roman coins and pottery have been found circulating at native settlement sites in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] in the years before 100, indicating growing [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Some of the most important sources for this era are the writing tablets from the fort at [[Vindolanda]] in [[Northumberland]], mostly dating to 90\u2013110. These tablets provide vivid evidence for the operation of a Roman fort at the edge of the Roman Empire, where officers' wives maintained polite society while merchants, hauliers and military personnel kept the fort operational and supplied.\n\nAround 105 there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the [[Picts]] of [[Alba]]: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged [[armour]] at ''[[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]]'' (at modern [[Newstead, Scottish Borders|Newstead]], in SE Scotland) indicating hostilities at least at that site. There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany, and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a [[tribune]] of [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]]. [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat. The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal, in order to deny resources to an enemy. In either case, the frontier probably moved south to the line of the [[Stanegate]] at the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]\u2013[[River Tyne|Tyne]] isthmus around this time.\n\n[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed looking east from [[Vercovicium]] (Housesteads)]]\n[[File:Prima Europe tabula.jpg|thumb|left|''Prima Europe tabula''. A 1486 copy of [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century map of Roman Britain]]\nA new crisis occurred at the beginning of [[Hadrian]]'s reign (117): a rising in the north which was suppressed by [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]]. When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120, he directed an extensive defensive wall, known to posterity as [[Hadrian's Wall]], to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier. Hadrian appointed [[Aulus Platorius Nepos]] as governor to undertake this work who brought the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio VI Victrix]]}}'' legion with him from ''{{lang|la|[[Germania Inferior]]}}''. This replaced the famous ''{{lang|la|[[Legio IX Hispana]]}}'', whose disappearance has been much discussed. Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the 2nd century, and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context.\n\nIn the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138\u2013161) the Hadrianic border was briefly extended north to the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus, where the [[Antonine Wall]] was built around 142 following the military reoccupation of the Scottish lowlands by a new governor, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].\n\nThe first Antonine occupation of Scotland ended as a result of a further crisis in 155\u2013157, when the [[Brigantes]] revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Verus]]. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably connected with Antoninus's undertakings to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180.\n\nDuring the twenty-year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian's Wall in 163/4, Rome was concerned with continental issues, primarily [[marcomannic Wars|problems]] in the [[Danube|Danubian]] provinces. Increasing numbers of [[hoard]]s of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver has been found in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade, and it is likely that the Romans were reinforcing [[treaty]] agreements by paying tribute to their implacable enemies, the Picts.\n\nIn 175, a large force of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men, arrived in Britannia, probably to reinforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. In 180, Hadrian's Wall was breached by the Picts and the commanding officer or governor was killed there in what [[Cassius Dio]] described as the most serious war of the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Ulpius Marcellus]] was sent as replacement governor and by 184 he had won a new peace, only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus's strictness, they tried to elect a legate named [[Caerellius Priscus|Priscus]] as usurper governor; he refused, but Marcellus was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination: they sent a delegation of 1,500 to Rome to demand the execution of [[Tigidius Perennis]], a [[Praetorian prefect]] who they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly [[equites]] to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perennis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.\n\nThe future emperor [[Pertinax]] was sent to Britannia to quell the mutiny and was initially successful in regaining control, but a riot broke out among the troops. Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and asked to be recalled to Rome, where he briefly succeeded Commodus as emperor in 192.\n\n=== 3rd century ===\nThe death of Commodus put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of Pertinax, several rivals for the emperorship emerged, including [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. The latter was the new governor of Britannia, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of ''Caesar'' in return for Albinus's support against [[Pescennius Niger]] in the east. Once Niger was neutralised, Severus turned on his ally in Britannia&nbsp;\u2014 it is likely that Albinus saw he would be the next target and was already preparing for war.\n\nAlbinus crossed to [[Gaul]] in 195, where the provinces were also sympathetic to him, and set up at [[Lugdunum]]. Severus arrived in February 196, and the ensuing battle was decisive. Albinus came close to victory, but Severus's reinforcements won the day, and the British governor committed suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus's sympathisers and perhaps confiscated large tracts of land in Britain as punishment.\n\nAlbinus had demonstrated the major problem posed by Roman Britain. In order to maintain security, the province required the presence of three legions; but command of these forces provided an ideal power base for ambitious rivals. Deploying those legions elsewhere would strip the island of its garrison, leaving the province defenceless against uprisings by the native Celtic tribes and against invasion by the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].\n\nThe traditional view is that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus's absence. Cassius Dio records that the new Governor, [[Virius Lupus]], was obliged to buy peace from a fractious northern tribe known as the [[Maeatae]]. The succession of militarily distinguished governors who were subsequently appointed suggests that enemies of Rome were posing a difficult challenge, and [[Lucius Alfenus Senecio]]'s report to Rome in 207 describes barbarians \"rebelling, over-running the land, taking loot and creating destruction\". In order to rebel, of course, one must be a subject&nbsp;\u2014 the Maeatae clearly did not consider themselves such. Senecio requested either reinforcements or an Imperial expedition, and Severus chose the latter, despite being 62 years old.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian's Wall and the forts beyond it, and Severus's arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory, and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] with first-hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land.\n[[File:Roman.Britain.Severan.Campaigns.jpg|thumb|Northern campaigns, 208\u2013211]]\nAn [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210|invasion of Caledonia]] led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops moved north in 208 or 209, crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The emperor's forces pushed north as far as the [[River Tay]], but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion, as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians. By 210 Severus had returned to York, and the frontier had once again become Hadrian's Wall. He assumed the title ''{{lang|la|Britannicus}}'' but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north, which clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire. Almost immediately, another northern tribe, the [[Maeatae]], again went to war. Caracalla left with a [[punitive expedition]], but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne.\n\nAs one of his last acts, Severus tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the province into ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Superior]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Inferior]]}}''. This kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period known as the Long Peace. Even so, the number of buried hoards found from this period rises, suggesting continuing unrest. A string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy; and over the following hundred years they increased in number, becoming the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore Forts]].\n\nDuring the middle of the 3rd century, the Roman Empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, but increasing [[inflation]] had its economic effect. In 259 a so-called [[Gallic Empire]] was established when [[Postumus]] rebelled against [[Gallienus]]. Britannia was part of this until 274 when [[Aurelian]] reunited the empire.\n\nAround the year 280, a half-[[Romano-Britons|British]] officer named [[Bonosus (usurper)|Bonosus]] was in command of the Roman's [[Classis Germanica|Rhenish fleet]] when the [[Germania|Germans]] managed to burn it at anchor. To avoid punishment, he [[Roman usurper|proclaimed himself emperor]] at [[Colonia Agrippina]] ([[Cologne]]) but was crushed by [[Marcus Aurelius Probus]]. Soon afterwards, an unnamed [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] of one of the British provinces also attempted an uprising. Probus put it down by sending irregular troops of [[Vandals]] and [[Burgundians]] across the Channel.\n\nThe [[Carausian Revolt]] led to a short-lived [[Britannic Empire]] from 286 to 296. [[Carausius]] was a [[Menapii|Menapian]] [[Roman navy|naval]] commander of the [[Classis Britannica|Britannic fleet]]; he revolted upon learning of a death sentence ordered by the emperor [[Maximian]] on charges of having abetted [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] [[Roman piracy|pirates]] and having embezzled recovered treasure. He consolidated control over all the provinces of Britain and some of northern Gaul while Maximian dealt with other uprisings. An invasion in 288 failed to unseat him and an uneasy peace ensued, with Carausius issuing coins and inviting official recognition. In 293, the [[caesar (title)|junior emperor]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel port of [[Gesoriacum]] ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]) by land and sea. After it fell, Constantius attacked Carausius's other Gallic holdings and Frankish allies and Carausius was usurped by his treasurer, [[Allectus]]. [[Julius Asclepiodotus]] landed an invasion fleet near [[Southampton]] and defeated Allectus in a land battle.<ref>{{citation |author=Anonymous |title=[[Panegyrici Latini]] |at=VIII.10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Aurelius Victor]] |title=Liber de Caesaribus  |language=la|trans-title=Book of Caesars |at=[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] |title=Breviarium historiae Romanae  |language=la|trans-title=Abridgement of Roman History |at=[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21\u201322] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=[[Orosius]] |title=Historiae Adversus Paganos  |language=la|trans-title=Seven Books of History Against the Pagans |at=[http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7.25] }}</ref>\n\n=== Diocletian's reforms ===\n{{main|Britannia I|Britannia II|Flavia Caesariensis|Maxima Caesariensis|Valentia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Roman Britain 410.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|One possible arrangement of the late Roman provinces, with [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] between the walls.]]\n[[File:Roman Britain - AD 400.png|right|upright=0.9|thumb|Another possible arrangement, with other possible placements of [[Valentia (Roman province)|Valentia]] noted.]]\nAs part of [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian's reforms]], the provinces of Roman Britain were organized as a [[Roman diocese|diocese]] subordinate to a praetorian prefect resident with an emperor and from 318 a prefect based at [[Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]), Julius Bassus, prefect to Constantine's son Crispus.\n\nPrior to this appointment, two was the canonical number of prefects (not counting those of usurpers). The territorial prefectures first appear circa 325. Four are listed in 331. It is certain that the [[vicarius|diocesan vicar]] was based at Londinium as the principal city of the diocese, as it had been for 250 years;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} that Londinium and Eboracum continued as provincial capitals; and that the territory was divided up into smaller provinces for administrative efficiency and presence as the governors, heretofore mainly judicial and administrative officials, assumed more financial duties (as the procurators of the Treasury ministry were slowly phased out in the first three decades of the 4th century).\n\nThe governors were stripped of military command (a process completed by 314), which was handed over to duces. Civilian and military authority would no longer be exercised by one official, with rare exceptions until the mid-5th century, when a dux/governor was appointed for Upper Egypt. The tasks of the vicar were to control and coordinate the activities of governors; monitor but not interfere with the daily functioning of the Treasury and Crown Estates, which had their own administrative infrastructure; and act as the regional quartermaster-general of the armed forces. In short, as the sole civilian official with superior authority, he had general oversight of the administration, as well as direct control, while not absolute, over governors who were part of the prefecture; the other two fiscal departments were not.\n\nThe early-4th-century [[Verona List]], the late-4th-century work of [[Sextus Rufus]], and the early-5th-century [[Notitia Dignitatum|List of Offices]] and work of [[Polemius Silvius]] all list four provinces by some variation of the names [[Britannia Prima|Britannia I]], [[Britannia Secunda|Britannia II]], [[Maxima Caesariensis]], and [[Flavia Caesariensis]]; all of these seem to have initially been directed by a [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] (''[[praeses]]'') of [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank.

Valentia is placed variously in northern Wales around [[Deva Victrix|Deva]] ([[Chester]]); beside [[Hadrian's Wall]] around [[Luguvalium]] ([[Carlisle, England|Carlisle]]); and between the walls along [[Dere Street]].\n\n=== 4th century ===\nConstantius Chlorus returned in 306, despite his poor health, aiming to invade northern Britain, with the provincial defences having been rebuilt in the preceding years. Little is known of his campaigns with scant archaeological evidence, but fragmentary historical sources suggest he reached the far north of Britain and won a major battle in early summer before returning south. He died in [[York]] in July 306 with his son [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] at his side. Constantine then successfully used Britain as the starting point of his march to the imperial throne, unlike the earlier usurper, Albinus.\n\nIn the middle of the century, for a few years the province was loyal to the usurper [[Magnentius]], who succeeded [[Constans]] following the latter's death. After the defeat and death of Magnentius in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in 353, [[Constantius II]] dispatched his chief imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]] to Britain to hunt down Magnentius's supporters. The investigation deteriorated into a [[witch-hunt]], which forced the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' [[Flavius Martinus]] to intervene. When Paulus retaliated by accusing Martinus of treason, the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' attacked Paulus with a sword, with the aim of assassinating him, but in the end he committed suicide.\n\nAs the 4th century progressed, there were increasing attacks from the [[Saxons]] in the east and the [[Scoti]] (Irish) in the west. A series of forts was already being built, starting around 280, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when a general assault of Saxons, Scoti and [[Attacotti]], combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian's Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate in 367. This crisis, sometimes called the Barbarian Conspiracy or the [[Great Conspiracy]], was settled by [[Count Theodosius]] with a string of military and civil reforms.\n\nAnother imperial usurper, [[Magnus Maximus]], raised the standard of revolt at [[Segontium]] ([[Caernarfon]]) in north Wales in 383, and crossed the [[English Channel]]. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] around 384. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned in this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all the British troops may have returned: the Empire's military resources were stretched to the limit along the Rhine and Danube.\nAround 396 there were more barbarian incursions into Britain. [[Stilicho]] led a punitive expedition.\nIt seems peace was restored by 399, and it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered; by 401 more troops were withdrawn, to assist in the war against [[Alaric I]].\n\n=== End of Roman rule ===\n{{Main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}\n[[File:Brittain 410.jpg|thumb|Roman Britain in 410]]\nThe traditional view of historians, informed by the work of [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the 5th century. Consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation. Some features are agreed: more opulent but fewer urban houses, an end to new public building and some abandonment of existing ones, with the exception of defensive structures, and the widespread formation of \"[[dark earth]]\" deposits indicating increased horticulture within urban precincts.<ref>Archaeological evidence of late 4th-century urban collapse is analysed by {{cite book |author=Simon Esmonde Cleary |title=The Ending of Roman Britain |year=2000 }}; the \"de-romanisation\" of Britain is the subject of several accounts by Richard Reece, including \"Town and country: the end of Roman Britain\", ''World Archaeology'' '''12''' (1980:77\u201392) and \"The end of the city in Roman Britain\", in J.

Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed. There were growing barbarian attacks, but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns. Some villas such as [[Great Casterton]] in [[Rutland]] and [[Hucclecote]] in [[Gloucestershire]] had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy. Many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the 5th century; the story of [[Saint Patrick]] indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. Exceptionally, new buildings were still going up in this period in [[Verulamium]] and [[Cirencester]]. Some urban centres, for example [[Canterbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Wroxeter]], [[Winchester]] and [[Gloucester]], remained active during the 5th and 6th centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.\n\nUrban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the 4th century, and coins minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, problems with the payment of soldiers and officials or with unstable conditions during the usurpation of Magnus Maximus 383\u201387. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, but never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, though minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were very few new Roman coins going into circulation, and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Mass-produced wheel thrown pottery ended at approximately the same time; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor made do with humble \"grey ware\" or resorted to leather or wooden containers.\n\n=== Sub-Roman Britain ===\n{{Main|Sub-Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Arth tapestry2.jpg|thumb|[[King Arthur]] is a legendary figure of [[Sub-Roman Britain]] who is said to have fought the invading Saxons. Tapestry in [[The Cloisters]], New York.]]\nTowards the end of the 4th century Britain came under increasing pressure from [[barbarian]] attacks, and there were not enough troops to mount an effective defence. After elevating two disappointing [[Roman usurper|usurpers]], the army chose a soldier, [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], to become emperor in 407. He crossed to Gaul but was defeated by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]; it is unclear how many troops remained or ever returned, or whether a commander-in-chief in Britain was ever reappointed. A [[Saxons|Saxon]] incursion in 408 was apparently repelled by the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], and in 409 [[Zosimus]] records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration. Zosimus may be referring to the Bacaudic rebellion of the [[Bretons|Breton]] inhabitants of [[Armorica]] since he describes how, in the aftermath of the revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai. A letter from Emperor Honorius in 410 has traditionally been seen as rejecting a British appeal for help, but it may have been addressed to [[Calabria|Bruttium]] or [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"Moorhead\">{{cite book |author1=Sam Moorhead |author2=David Stuttard |year=2012 |title=The Romans who Shaped Britain |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-25189-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/romanswhoshapedb0000moor/page/238 238] |url=https://archive.org/details/romanswhoshapedb0000moor/page/238 }}</ref> With the imperial layers of the military and civil government gone, administration and justice fell to municipal authorities, and local warlords gradually emerged all over Britain, still utilizing [[Romano-British]] ideals and conventions.

There is recorded evidence, for example, of Germanic [[auxilia]]ries supporting the legions in Britain in the 1st and 2nd centuries.) \nThe new arrivals rebelled, plunging the country into a series of wars that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600. Around this time, many Britons fled to [[Brittany]] (hence its name), [[Britonia|Galicia]] and probably [[Ireland]]. A significant date in sub-Roman Britain is the [[Groans of the Britons]], an unanswered appeal to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], leading general of the western Empire, for assistance against Saxon invasion in 446. Another is the [[Battle of Deorham]] in 577, after which the significant cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Gloucester]] fell and the Saxons reached the western sea.\n\nMost scholars reject the historicity of the later [[legend]]s of [[King Arthur]], which seem to be set in this period, but some such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] think there may be some truth to them.\n\n== Trade ==\n{{See also|British Iron Age#Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world|l1=Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world}}\n\nDuring the Roman period Britain's continental trade was principally directed across the Southern [[North Sea]] and Eastern [[English Channel|Channel]], focusing on the narrow [[Strait of Dover]], with more limited links via the Atlantic seaways.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\">{{cite book |author=Francis Morris |year=2010 |title=North Sea and Channel Connectivity during the Late Iron Age and Roman Period (175/150 BC&nbsp;\u2013 409&nbsp;AD) |series=British Archaeological Reports International Series |issue=2157 |location=Oxford |publisher=Archaeopress }}</ref><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\">{{citation |author=Michael Fulford |year=2007 |chapter=Coasting Britannia: Roman trade and traffic around the shores of Britain |editor1=Chris Gosden |editor2=Helena Hamerow |editor3=Philip de Jersey |editor4=Gary Lock |editor4-link=Gary Lock |title=Communities and Connections: Essays in Honour of Barry Cunliffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYwMxyTBQIC |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923034-1 |pages=54\u201374 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cunliffe\">{{cite book |author=Barry Cunliffe |year=2002 |title=Facing the Ocean: the Atlantic and its Peoples 8000 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1500&nbsp;AD |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Mx-AAAACAAJ |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-285354-7 }}</ref> The most important British ports were London and [[Richborough Castle|Richborough]], whilst the continental ports most heavily engaged in trade with Britain were [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and the sites of [[Domburg]] and [[Colijnsplaat]] at the mouth of the river [[Scheldt]].<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/> During the Late Roman period it is likely that the [[saxon Shore|shore forts]] played some role in continental trade alongside their defensive functions.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Andrew Pearson |year=2002 |title=The Roman Shore Forts: Coastal Defences of Southern Britain |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-1949-7 }}</ref>\n\nExports to Britain included: [[roman currency|coin]]; [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]], particularly red-gloss ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}'' (samian ware) from southern, central and eastern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], as well as various other wares from Gaul and the [[Rhine]] provinces; olive oil from southern [[Hispania|Spain]] in ''{{lang|la|[[amphora]]e}}''; wine from Gaul in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}'' and barrels; salted fish products from the western Mediterranean and [[Brittany]] in barrels and amphorae; preserved olives from southern Spain in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}''; lava [[quern-stone]]s from [[Mayen]] on the middle Rhine; glass; and some agricultural products.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyers Pottery\">{{cite book |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman Pottery in Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JFlQgAACAAJ |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-7412-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tyers amphorae\">{{cite journal |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman amphoras in Britain |journal=Internet Archaeology |volume=1 |publisher=Council for British Archaeology |doi=10.11141/ia.1.6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Peacock & Williams\">{{cite book |author1=D.

The mine developed as a series of opencast workings, mainly by the use of [[hydraulic mining]] methods. They are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] in great detail. Essentially, water supplied by [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the [[bedrock]]. If veins were present, they were attacked using [[fire-setting]] and the ore removed for crushing and [[comminution]]. The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and [[gold nugget]]s collected in [[riffle#Gold mining|riffles]]. The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from {{c.|lk=no}} 75 through to the 1st century. When opencast work was no longer feasible, tunnels were driven to follow the veins. The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers.\n\nThe [[Weald]]en ironworking zone, the lead and silver mines of the [[Mendip Hills]] and the tin mines of Cornwall seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Mining had long been practised in Britain (see [[Grimes Graves]]), but the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. It included [[hydraulic mining]] to prospect for ore by removing overburden as well as work alluvial deposits. The water needed for such large-scale operations was supplied by one or more [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], those surviving at Dolaucothi being especially impressive. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, [[highland|upland]] country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.\n\nRoman designs were most popular, but rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the [[Iron Age]] [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] artistic traditions. Local pottery rarely attained the standards of the Gaulish industries; the [[Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware|Castor ware]] of the [[River Nene|Nene Valley]] was able to withstand comparison with the imports. Most native pottery was unsophisticated and intended only for local markets.\n\nBy the 3rd century, Britain's economy was diverse and well established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north. The design of [[Hadrian's Wall]] especially catered to the need for customs inspections of merchants' goods.\n\n== Government ==<!--linked-->\nUnder the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but those, like Britain, that required permanent garrisons, were placed under the Emperor's control. In practice imperial provinces were run by resident [[Roman governor|governors]] who were members of the Senate and had held the [[Roman consul|consulship]]. These men were carefully selected, often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor's role was primarily military, but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility, such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the ''{{lang|la|[[civitas|civitates]]}}'' and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning, he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.\n\nTo assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the ''{{lang|la|legatus juridicus}}'', and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a ''[[promagistrate|procurator]]'' with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and in time of war probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces. Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.\n\nColchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain, but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections.  The different forms of municipal organisation in Britannia were known as ''{{lang|la|civitas}}'' (which were subdivided, amongst other forms, into ''{{lang|la|colonies}}'' such as York, Colchester, Gloucester and Lincoln and ''municipalities'' such as Verulamium), and were each governed by a senate of local landowners, whether Brythonic or Roman, who elected magistrates concerning judicial and civic affairs.<ref name=\"Jones 1998\">{{cite book |author=Michael E.

The towns suffered attrition in the later 4th century, when public building ceased and some were abandoned to private uses. Place names survived the deurbanised Sub-Roman and early Anglo-Saxon periods, and historiography has been at pains to signal the expected survivals, but archaeology shows that a bare handful of Roman towns were continuously occupied. According to S.T. Loseby,<ref name=\"Loseby\"/> the very idea of a town as a centre of power and administration was reintroduced to England by the Roman Christianising mission to Canterbury, and its urban revival was delayed to the 10th century.\n\n[[File:The Great Bath in Bath (UK).jpg|thumb|[[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman public baths]] (''{{lang|la|[[thermae]]}}'') in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (''[[Aquae Sulis]]'').]]\nRoman towns can be broadly grouped in two categories.

According to its first translator, it was written in [[Wroxeter]] by a Christian man called Vinisius to a Christian woman called Nigra, and was claimed as the first epigraphic record of Christianity in Britain. This translation of the letter was apparently based on grave paleographical errors, and the text, in fact, has nothing to do with Christianity, and in fact relates to pagan rituals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=R.

The Romans also built water supply, [[sanitation]] and [[wastewater]] systems. Many of Britain's major cities, such as London ([[Londinium]]), [[Manchester]] ([[Mamucium]]) and [[York]] ([[Eboracum]]), were founded by the Romans, but the original Roman settlements were abandoned not long after the Romans left.\n\nUnlike many other areas of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the current majority language is not a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] \u2013 or a language descended from the pre-Roman inhabitants. The British language at the time of the invasion was [[Common Brittonic]], and remained so after the Romans withdrew. It later split into regional languages, notably [[Cumbric Language|Cumbric]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Examination of these languages suggests some 800 Latin words were incorporated into Common Brittonic (see [[Brittonic languages]]). The current majority language, English, is based on the languages of the Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe from the 5th century onwards.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Prehistoric Britain]]\n* [[Britannia (disambiguation)]]\n* [[End of Roman rule in Britain]]\n* [[Governors of Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain]]\n* [[History of the British Isles]]\n* [[Romano-British culture]]\n* [[Sub-Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman sites in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Mining in Roman Britain]]\n* [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]]\n* [[Scotland during the Roman Empire]]\n* [[Romano-Celtic temple]]\n*[[Roman sites in Great Britain]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n=== Iron Age background ===\n* {{cite book |author=John Creighton |year=2000 |title=Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwlUgNrYW8MC |isbn=978-1-139-43172-9 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Barry Cunliffe |year=2005 |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}\n\n=== General works on Roman Britain ===\n* {{cite book |author=Joan P Alcock |year=2011 |title=A Brief History of Roman Britain Conquest and Civilization |location=London |publisher=Constable & Robinson |isbn=978-1-84529-728-2 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re]] |year=2006 |title=Roman Britain: a New History |location=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-05140-5 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Simon Esmonde-Cleary |year=1989 |title=The Ending of Roman Britain |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-415-23898-4 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Sheppard Frere |year=1987 |title=Britannia.

He was brought as a captive to Rome, where a dignified speech he made during Claudius's triumph persuaded the emperor to spare his life. The Silures were still not pacified, and Cartimandua's ex-husband [[Venutius]] replaced Caratacus as the most prominent leader of British resistance.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31\u201338] }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Nero]]'s accession Roman Britain extended as far north as [[Lindum Colonia|Lindum]]. [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the conqueror of [[Mauretania]] (modern day [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]]), then became governor of Britain, and in 60 and 61 he moved against Mona ([[Anglesey]]) to settle accounts with [[Druid]]ism once and for all. Paulinus led his army across the [[Menai Strait]] and massacred the Druids and burnt their sacred groves.\n\nWhile Paulinus was [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|campaigning in Mona]], the southeast of Britain rose in revolt under the leadership of [[Boudica]]. Boudica was the widow of the recently deceased king of the Iceni, Prasutagus. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Prasutagus had left a will leaving half his kingdom to Nero in the hope that the remainder would be left untouched. He was wrong. When his will was enforced, Rome responded by violently seizing the tribe's lands in full. Boudica protested. In consequence, Rome punished her and her daughters by flogging and rape. In response, the Iceni, joined by the [[Trinovantes]], destroyed the Roman colony at Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]) and [[Battle of Camulodunum|routed]] the part of the IXth Legion that was sent to relieve it. Paulinus rode to [[London]] (then called [[Londinium]]), the rebels' next target, but concluded it could not be defended. Abandoned, it was destroyed, as was [[Verulamium]] (St. Albans). Between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed in the three cities. But Paulinus regrouped with two of the three legions still available to him, chose a battlefield, and, despite being outnumbered by more than twenty to one, defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Watling Street]]. Boudica died not long afterwards, by self-administered poison or by illness.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Agricola |at=[[:s:Agricola#14|14.17]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.29 14.29\u201339] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Cassius Dio |title=Historia Romana  |language=la|at=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html#1 62.1\u201312] }}</ref> During this time, the Emperor Nero considered withdrawing Roman forces from Britain altogether.<ref>{{citation |author=Suetonius |title=[[The Twelve Caesars#Nero|Nero]] |at=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18] }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Templeborough Roman Fort visualised 3D flythrough - Rotherham.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.65|[[Templeborough|Templeborough Roman fort]] in South Yorkshire.

As civil war raged in Rome, weak governors were unable to control the legions in Britain, and Venutius of the Brigantes seized his chance. The Romans had previously defended Cartimandua against him, but this time were unable to do so. Cartimandua was evacuated, and Venutius was left in control of the north of the country. After Vespasian secured the empire, his first two appointments as governor, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] and [[Frontinus|Sextus Julius Frontinus]], took on the task of subduing the Brigantes and Silures respectively.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Agricola  |language=la|at=[[:s:Agricola#16|16\u201317]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]] |at=[[:s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#60|1.60]], [[:s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#45|3.45]] }}</ref> Frontinus extended Roman rule to all of [[South Wales]], and initiated exploitation of the mineral resources, such as the [[gold mining|gold mines]] at [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines|Dolaucothi]].\n\nIn the following years, the Romans conquered more of the island, increasing the size of Roman Britain. Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], father-in-law to the historian [[Tacitus]], conquered the [[Ordovices]] in 78. With the ''{{lang|la|XX Valeria Victrix}}'' legion, Agricola defeated the [[Caledonians]] in 84 at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], in northern Scotland.<ref>{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Agricola  |language=la|at=[[:s:Agricola#18|18.38]] }}</ref> This was the high-water mark of Roman territory in Britain: shortly after his victory, Agricola was recalled from Britain back to Rome, and the Romans retired to a more defensible line along the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]]\u2013[[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] isthmus, freeing soldiers badly needed along other frontiers.\n\nFor much of the history of Roman Britain, a large number of soldiers were garrisoned on the island. This required that the emperor station a trusted senior man as governor of the province. As a result, many future emperors served as governors or legates in this province, including [[Vespasian]], [[Pertinax]], and [[Gordian I]].\n{{Gallery\n|title  = Roman military organisation in the north\n|align  = right\n|width  = 180\n|height = 180\n|lines  = 2\n|File:Roman.Scotland.north.84.jpg|In 84 AD\n|File:Roman.Scotland.north.155.jpg|In 155 AD\n}}\n\n=== Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland ===\nThere is no historical source describing the decades that followed Agricola's recall. Even the name of his replacement is unknown. Archaeology has shown that some [[Castra|Roman forts]] south of the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus were rebuilt and enlarged; others appear to have been abandoned. Roman coins and pottery have been found circulating at native settlement sites in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] in the years before 100, indicating growing [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Some of the most important sources for this era are the writing tablets from the fort at [[Vindolanda]] in [[Northumberland]], mostly dating to 90\u2013110. These tablets provide vivid evidence for the operation of a Roman fort at the edge of the Roman Empire, where officers' wives maintained polite society while merchants, hauliers and military personnel kept the fort operational and supplied.\n\nAround 105 there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the [[Picts]] of [[Alba]]: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged [[armour]] at ''[[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]]'' (at modern [[Newstead, Scottish Borders|Newstead]], in SE Scotland) indicating hostilities at least at that site. There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany, and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a [[tribune]] of [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]]. [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat. The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal, in order to deny resources to an enemy. In either case, the frontier probably moved south to the line of the [[Stanegate]] at the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]\u2013[[River Tyne|Tyne]] isthmus around this time.\n\n[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed looking east from [[Vercovicium]] (Housesteads)]]\n[[File:Prima Europe tabula.jpg|thumb|left|''Prima Europe tabula''. A 1486 copy of [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century map of Roman Britain]]\nA new crisis occurred at the beginning of [[Hadrian]]'s reign (117): a rising in the north which was suppressed by [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]]. When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120, he directed an extensive defensive wall, known to posterity as [[Hadrian's Wall]], to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier. Hadrian appointed [[Aulus Platorius Nepos]] as governor to undertake this work who brought the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio VI Victrix]]}}'' legion with him from ''{{lang|la|[[Germania Inferior]]}}''. This replaced the famous ''{{lang|la|[[Legio IX Hispana]]}}'', whose disappearance has been much discussed. Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the 2nd century, and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context.\n\nIn the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138\u2013161) the Hadrianic border was briefly extended north to the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus, where the [[Antonine Wall]] was built around 142 following the military reoccupation of the Scottish lowlands by a new governor, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].\n\nThe first Antonine occupation of Scotland ended as a result of a further crisis in 155\u2013157, when the [[Brigantes]] revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Verus]]. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably connected with Antoninus's undertakings to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180.\n\nDuring the twenty-year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian's Wall in 163/4, Rome was concerned with continental issues, primarily [[marcomannic Wars|problems]] in the [[Danube|Danubian]] provinces. Increasing numbers of [[hoard]]s of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver has been found in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade, and it is likely that the Romans were reinforcing [[treaty]] agreements by paying tribute to their implacable enemies, the Picts.\n\nIn 175, a large force of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men, arrived in Britannia, probably to reinforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. In 180, Hadrian's Wall was breached by the Picts and the commanding officer or governor was killed there in what [[Cassius Dio]] described as the most serious war of the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Ulpius Marcellus]] was sent as replacement governor and by 184 he had won a new peace, only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus's strictness, they tried to elect a legate named [[Caerellius Priscus|Priscus]] as usurper governor; he refused, but Marcellus was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination: they sent a delegation of 1,500 to Rome to demand the execution of [[Tigidius Perennis]], a [[Praetorian prefect]] who they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly [[equites]] to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perennis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.\n\nThe future emperor [[Pertinax]] was sent to Britannia to quell the mutiny and was initially successful in regaining control, but a riot broke out among the troops. Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and asked to be recalled to Rome, where he briefly succeeded Commodus as emperor in 192.\n\n=== 3rd century ===\nThe death of Commodus put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of Pertinax, several rivals for the emperorship emerged, including [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. The latter was the new governor of Britannia, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of ''Caesar'' in return for Albinus's support against [[Pescennius Niger]] in the east. Once Niger was neutralised, Severus turned on his ally in Britannia&nbsp;\u2014 it is likely that Albinus saw he would be the next target and was already preparing for war.\n\nAlbinus crossed to [[Gaul]] in 195, where the provinces were also sympathetic to him, and set up at [[Lugdunum]]. Severus arrived in February 196, and the ensuing battle was decisive. Albinus came close to victory, but Severus's reinforcements won the day, and the British governor committed suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus's sympathisers and perhaps confiscated large tracts of land in Britain as punishment.\n\nAlbinus had demonstrated the major problem posed by Roman Britain. In order to maintain security, the province required the presence of three legions; but command of these forces provided an ideal power base for ambitious rivals. Deploying those legions elsewhere would strip the island of its garrison, leaving the province defenceless against uprisings by the native Celtic tribes and against invasion by the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].\n\nThe traditional view is that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus's absence. Cassius Dio records that the new Governor, [[Virius Lupus]], was obliged to buy peace from a fractious northern tribe known as the [[Maeatae]]. The succession of militarily distinguished governors who were subsequently appointed suggests that enemies of Rome were posing a difficult challenge, and [[Lucius Alfenus Senecio]]'s report to Rome in 207 describes barbarians \"rebelling, over-running the land, taking loot and creating destruction\". In order to rebel, of course, one must be a subject&nbsp;\u2014 the Maeatae clearly did not consider themselves such. Senecio requested either reinforcements or an Imperial expedition, and Severus chose the latter, despite being 62 years old.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian's Wall and the forts beyond it, and Severus's arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory, and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] with first-hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land.\n[[File:Roman.Britain.Severan.Campaigns.jpg|thumb|Northern campaigns, 208\u2013211]]\nAn [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210|invasion of Caledonia]] led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops moved north in 208 or 209, crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The emperor's forces pushed north as far as the [[River Tay]], but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion, as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians. By 210 Severus had returned to York, and the frontier had once again become Hadrian's Wall. He assumed the title ''{{lang|la|Britannicus}}'' but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north, which clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire. Almost immediately, another northern tribe, the [[Maeatae]], again went to war. Caracalla left with a [[punitive expedition]], but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne.\n\nAs one of his last acts, Severus tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the province into ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Superior]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Britannia Inferior]]}}''. This kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period known as the Long Peace. Even so, the number of buried hoards found from this period rises, suggesting continuing unrest. A string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy; and over the following hundred years they increased in number, becoming the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore Forts]].\n\nDuring the middle of the 3rd century, the Roman Empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, but increasing [[inflation]] had its economic effect. In 259 a so-called [[Gallic Empire]] was established when [[Postumus]] rebelled against [[Gallienus]]. Britannia was part of this until 274 when [[Aurelian]] reunited the empire.\n\nAround the year 280, a half-[[Romano-Britons|British]] officer named [[Bonosus (usurper)|Bonosus]] was in command of the Roman's [[Classis Germanica|Rhenish fleet]] when the [[Germania|Germans]] managed to burn it at anchor. To avoid punishment, he [[Roman usurper|proclaimed himself emperor]] at [[Colonia Agrippina]] ([[Cologne]]) but was crushed by [[Marcus Aurelius Probus]]. Soon afterwards, an unnamed [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] of one of the British provinces also attempted an uprising. Probus put it down by sending irregular troops of [[Vandals]] and [[Burgundians]] across the Channel.\n\nThe [[Carausian Revolt]] led to a short-lived [[Britannic Empire]] from 286 to 296. [[Carausius]] was a [[Menapii|Menapian]] [[Roman navy|naval]] commander of the [[Classis Britannica|Britannic fleet]]; he revolted upon learning of a death sentence ordered by the emperor [[Maximian]] on charges of having abetted [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] [[Roman piracy|pirates]] and having embezzled recovered treasure. He consolidated control over all the provinces of Britain and some of northern Gaul while Maximian dealt with other uprisings. An invasion in 288 failed to unseat him and an uneasy peace ensued, with Carausius issuing coins and inviting official recognition. In 293, the [[caesar (title)|junior emperor]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel port of [[Gesoriacum]] ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]) by land and sea. After it fell, Constantius attacked Carausius's other Gallic holdings and Frankish allies and Carausius was usurped by his treasurer, [[Allectus]]. [[Julius Asclepiodotus]] landed an invasion fleet near [[Southampton]] and defeated Allectus in a land battle.<ref>{{citation |author=Anonymous |title=[[Panegyrici Latini]] |at=VIII.10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Aurelius Victor]] |title=Liber de Caesaribus  |language=la|trans-title=Book of Caesars |at=[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] |title=Breviarium historiae Romanae  |language=la|trans-title=Abridgement of Roman History |at=[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21\u201322] }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=[[Orosius]] |title=Historiae Adversus Paganos  |language=la|trans-title=Seven Books of History Against the Pagans |at=[http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7.25] }}</ref>\n\n=== Diocletian's reforms ===\n{{main|Britannia I|Britannia II|Flavia Caesariensis|Maxima Caesariensis|Valentia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Roman Britain 410.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|One possible arrangement of the late Roman provinces, with [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] between the walls.]]\n[[File:Roman Britain - AD 400.png|right|upright=0.9|thumb|Another possible arrangement, with other possible placements of [[Valentia (Roman province)|Valentia]] noted.]]\nAs part of [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian's reforms]], the provinces of Roman Britain were organized as a [[Roman diocese|diocese]] subordinate to a praetorian prefect resident with an emperor and from 318 a prefect based at [[Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]), Julius Bassus, prefect to Constantine's son Crispus.\n\nPrior to this appointment, two was the canonical number of prefects (not counting those of usurpers). The territorial prefectures first appear circa 325. Four are listed in 331. It is certain that the [[vicarius|diocesan vicar]] was based at Londinium as the principal city of the diocese, as it had been for 250 years;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} that Londinium and Eboracum continued as provincial capitals; and that the territory was divided up into smaller provinces for administrative efficiency and presence as the governors, heretofore mainly judicial and administrative officials, assumed more financial duties (as the procurators of the Treasury ministry were slowly phased out in the first three decades of the 4th century).\n\nThe governors were stripped of military command (a process completed by 314), which was handed over to duces. Civilian and military authority would no longer be exercised by one official, with rare exceptions until the mid-5th century, when a dux/governor was appointed for Upper Egypt. The tasks of the vicar were to control and coordinate the activities of governors; monitor but not interfere with the daily functioning of the Treasury and Crown Estates, which had their own administrative infrastructure; and act as the regional quartermaster-general of the armed forces. In short, as the sole civilian official with superior authority, he had general oversight of the administration, as well as direct control, while not absolute, over governors who were part of the prefecture; the other two fiscal departments were not.\n\nThe early-4th-century [[Verona List]], the late-4th-century work of [[Sextus Rufus]], and the early-5th-century [[Notitia Dignitatum|List of Offices]] and work of [[Polemius Silvius]] all list four provinces by some variation of the names [[Britannia Prima|Britannia I]], [[Britannia Secunda|Britannia II]], [[Maxima Caesariensis]], and [[Flavia Caesariensis]]; all of these seem to have initially been directed by a [[governors of Roman Britain|governor]] (''[[praeses]]'') of [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank. The 5th-century sources list a fifth province named [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] and give its governor and Maxima's a [[Roman consul|consular]] rank.{{refn|The [[Verona List]] actually includes a note that the Diocese of the Britains had ''six'' provinces, but then lists four.

Valentia is placed variously in northern Wales around [[Deva Victrix|Deva]] ([[Chester]]); beside [[Hadrian's Wall]] around [[Luguvalium]] ([[Carlisle, England|Carlisle]]); and between the walls along [[Dere Street]].\n\n=== 4th century ===\nConstantius Chlorus returned in 306, despite his poor health, aiming to invade northern Britain, with the provincial defences having been rebuilt in the preceding years. Little is known of his campaigns with scant archaeological evidence, but fragmentary historical sources suggest he reached the far north of Britain and won a major battle in early summer before returning south. He died in [[York]] in July 306 with his son [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] at his side. Constantine then successfully used Britain as the starting point of his march to the imperial throne, unlike the earlier usurper, Albinus.\n\nIn the middle of the century, for a few years the province was loyal to the usurper [[Magnentius]], who succeeded [[Constans]] following the latter's death. After the defeat and death of Magnentius in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in 353, [[Constantius II]] dispatched his chief imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]] to Britain to hunt down Magnentius's supporters. The investigation deteriorated into a [[witch-hunt]], which forced the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' [[Flavius Martinus]] to intervene. When Paulus retaliated by accusing Martinus of treason, the ''{{lang|la|vicarius}}'' attacked Paulus with a sword, with the aim of assassinating him, but in the end he committed suicide.\n\nAs the 4th century progressed, there were increasing attacks from the [[Saxons]] in the east and the [[Scoti]] (Irish) in the west. A series of forts was already being built, starting around 280, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when a general assault of Saxons, Scoti and [[Attacotti]], combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian's Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate in 367. This crisis, sometimes called the Barbarian Conspiracy or the [[Great Conspiracy]], was settled by [[Count Theodosius]] with a string of military and civil reforms.\n\nAnother imperial usurper, [[Magnus Maximus]], raised the standard of revolt at [[Segontium]] ([[Caernarfon]]) in north Wales in 383, and crossed the [[English Channel]]. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] around 384. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned in this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all the British troops may have returned: the Empire's military resources were stretched to the limit along the Rhine and Danube.\nAround 396 there were more barbarian incursions into Britain. [[Stilicho]] led a punitive expedition.\nIt seems peace was restored by 399, and it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered; by 401 more troops were withdrawn, to assist in the war against [[Alaric I]].\n\n=== End of Roman rule ===\n{{Main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}\n[[File:Brittain 410.jpg|thumb|Roman Britain in 410]]\nThe traditional view of historians, informed by the work of [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the 5th century. Consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation. Some features are agreed: more opulent but fewer urban houses, an end to new public building and some abandonment of existing ones, with the exception of defensive structures, and the widespread formation of \"[[dark earth]]\" deposits indicating increased horticulture within urban precincts.<ref>Archaeological evidence of late 4th-century urban collapse is analysed by {{cite book |author=Simon Esmonde Cleary |title=The Ending of Roman Britain |year=2000 }}; the \"de-romanisation\" of Britain is the subject of several accounts by Richard Reece, including \"Town and country: the end of Roman Britain\", ''World Archaeology'' '''12''' (1980:77\u201392) and \"The end of the city in Roman Britain\", in J.

Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed. There were growing barbarian attacks, but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns. Some villas such as [[Great Casterton]] in [[Rutland]] and [[Hucclecote]] in [[Gloucestershire]] had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy. Many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the 5th century; the story of [[Saint Patrick]] indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. Exceptionally, new buildings were still going up in this period in [[Verulamium]] and [[Cirencester]]. Some urban centres, for example [[Canterbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Wroxeter]], [[Winchester]] and [[Gloucester]], remained active during the 5th and 6th centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.\n\nUrban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the 4th century, and coins minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, problems with the payment of soldiers and officials or with unstable conditions during the usurpation of Magnus Maximus 383\u201387. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, but never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, though minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were very few new Roman coins going into circulation, and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Mass-produced wheel thrown pottery ended at approximately the same time; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor made do with humble \"grey ware\" or resorted to leather or wooden containers.\n\n=== Sub-Roman Britain ===\n{{Main|Sub-Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Arth tapestry2.jpg|thumb|[[King Arthur]] is a legendary figure of [[Sub-Roman Britain]] who is said to have fought the invading Saxons. Tapestry in [[The Cloisters]], New York.]]\nTowards the end of the 4th century Britain came under increasing pressure from [[barbarian]] attacks, and there were not enough troops to mount an effective defence. After elevating two disappointing [[Roman usurper|usurpers]], the army chose a soldier, [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], to become emperor in 407. He crossed to Gaul but was defeated by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]; it is unclear how many troops remained or ever returned, or whether a commander-in-chief in Britain was ever reappointed. A [[Saxons|Saxon]] incursion in 408 was apparently repelled by the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], and in 409 [[Zosimus]] records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration. Zosimus may be referring to the Bacaudic rebellion of the [[Bretons|Breton]] inhabitants of [[Armorica]] since he describes how, in the aftermath of the revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai. A letter from Emperor Honorius in 410 has traditionally been seen as rejecting a British appeal for help, but it may have been addressed to [[Calabria|Bruttium]] or [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"Moorhead\">{{cite book |author1=Sam Moorhead |author2=David Stuttard |year=2012 |title=The Romans who Shaped Britain |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-25189-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/romanswhoshapedb0000moor/page/238 238] |url=https://archive.org/details/romanswhoshapedb0000moor/page/238 }}</ref> With the imperial layers of the military and civil government gone, administration and justice fell to municipal authorities, and local warlords gradually emerged all over Britain, still utilizing [[Romano-British]] ideals and conventions.

There is recorded evidence, for example, of Germanic [[auxilia]]ries supporting the legions in Britain in the 1st and 2nd centuries.) \nThe new arrivals rebelled, plunging the country into a series of wars that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600. Around this time, many Britons fled to [[Brittany]] (hence its name), [[Britonia|Galicia]] and probably [[Ireland]]. A significant date in sub-Roman Britain is the [[Groans of the Britons]], an unanswered appeal to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], leading general of the western Empire, for assistance against Saxon invasion in 446. Another is the [[Battle of Deorham]] in 577, after which the significant cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Gloucester]] fell and the Saxons reached the western sea.\n\nMost scholars reject the historicity of the later [[legend]]s of [[King Arthur]], which seem to be set in this period, but some such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] think there may be some truth to them.\n\n== Trade ==\n{{See also|British Iron Age#Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world|l1=Trade between Iron Age Britain and the Roman world}}\n\nDuring the Roman period Britain's continental trade was principally directed across the Southern [[North Sea]] and Eastern [[English Channel|Channel]], focusing on the narrow [[Strait of Dover]], with more limited links via the Atlantic seaways.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\">{{cite book |author=Francis Morris |year=2010 |title=North Sea and Channel Connectivity during the Late Iron Age and Roman Period (175/150 BC&nbsp;\u2013 409&nbsp;AD) |series=British Archaeological Reports International Series |issue=2157 |location=Oxford |publisher=Archaeopress }}</ref><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\">{{citation |author=Michael Fulford |year=2007 |chapter=Coasting Britannia: Roman trade and traffic around the shores of Britain |editor1=Chris Gosden |editor2=Helena Hamerow |editor3=Philip de Jersey |editor4=Gary Lock |editor4-link=Gary Lock |title=Communities and Connections: Essays in Honour of Barry Cunliffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYwMxyTBQIC |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923034-1 |pages=54\u201374 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cunliffe\">{{cite book |author=Barry Cunliffe |year=2002 |title=Facing the Ocean: the Atlantic and its Peoples 8000 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1500&nbsp;AD |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Mx-AAAACAAJ |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-285354-7 }}</ref> The most important British ports were London and [[Richborough Castle|Richborough]], whilst the continental ports most heavily engaged in trade with Britain were [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and the sites of [[Domburg]] and [[Colijnsplaat]] at the mouth of the river [[Scheldt]].<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/> During the Late Roman period it is likely that the [[saxon Shore|shore forts]] played some role in continental trade alongside their defensive functions.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Andrew Pearson |year=2002 |title=The Roman Shore Forts: Coastal Defences of Southern Britain |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-1949-7 }}</ref>\n\nExports to Britain included: [[roman currency|coin]]; [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]], particularly red-gloss ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}'' (samian ware) from southern, central and eastern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], as well as various other wares from Gaul and the [[Rhine]] provinces; olive oil from southern [[Hispania|Spain]] in ''{{lang|la|[[amphora]]e}}''; wine from Gaul in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}'' and barrels; salted fish products from the western Mediterranean and [[Brittany]] in barrels and amphorae; preserved olives from southern Spain in ''{{lang|la|amphorae}}''; lava [[quern-stone]]s from [[Mayen]] on the middle Rhine; glass; and some agricultural products.<ref name=\"Morris 2010\"/><ref name=\"Fulford 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyers Pottery\">{{cite book |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman Pottery in Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JFlQgAACAAJ |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-7412-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tyers amphorae\">{{cite journal |author=Paul Tyers |year=1996 |title=Roman amphoras in Britain |journal=Internet Archaeology |volume=1 |publisher=Council for British Archaeology |doi=10.11141/ia.1.6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Peacock & Williams\">{{cite book |author1=D.

The mine developed as a series of opencast workings, mainly by the use of [[hydraulic mining]] methods. They are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] in great detail. Essentially, water supplied by [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the [[bedrock]]. If veins were present, they were attacked using [[fire-setting]] and the ore removed for crushing and [[comminution]]. The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and [[gold nugget]]s collected in [[riffle#Gold mining|riffles]]. The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from {{c.|lk=no}} 75 through to the 1st century. When opencast work was no longer feasible, tunnels were driven to follow the veins. The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers.\n\nThe [[Weald]]en ironworking zone, the lead and silver mines of the [[Mendip Hills]] and the tin mines of Cornwall seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Mining had long been practised in Britain (see [[Grimes Graves]]), but the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. It included [[hydraulic mining]] to prospect for ore by removing overburden as well as work alluvial deposits. The water needed for such large-scale operations was supplied by one or more [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], those surviving at Dolaucothi being especially impressive. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, [[highland|upland]] country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.\n\nRoman designs were most popular, but rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the [[Iron Age]] [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] artistic traditions. Local pottery rarely attained the standards of the Gaulish industries; the [[Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware|Castor ware]] of the [[River Nene|Nene Valley]] was able to withstand comparison with the imports. Most native pottery was unsophisticated and intended only for local markets.\n\nBy the 3rd century, Britain's economy was diverse and well established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north. The design of [[Hadrian's Wall]] especially catered to the need for customs inspections of merchants' goods.\n\n== Government ==<!--linked-->\nUnder the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but those, like Britain, that required permanent garrisons, were placed under the Emperor's control. In practice imperial provinces were run by resident [[Roman governor|governors]] who were members of the Senate and had held the [[Roman consul|consulship]]. These men were carefully selected, often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor's role was primarily military, but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility, such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the ''{{lang|la|[[civitas|civitates]]}}'' and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning, he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.\n\nTo assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the ''{{lang|la|legatus juridicus}}'', and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a ''[[promagistrate|procurator]]'' with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and in time of war probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces. Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.\n\nColchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain, but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections.  The different forms of municipal organisation in Britannia were known as ''{{lang|la|civitas}}'' (which were subdivided, amongst other forms, into ''{{lang|la|colonies}}'' such as York, Colchester, Gloucester and Lincoln and ''municipalities'' such as Verulamium), and were each governed by a senate of local landowners, whether Brythonic or Roman, who elected magistrates concerning judicial and civic affairs.<ref name=\"Jones 1998\">{{cite book |author=Michael E.

Eleven years later, Wazowski is now a first-year scare major at Monsters University (similar to Harvard University) where he meets [[Randall Boggs]], his roommate who he becomes immediate friends with, and [[James P. Sullivan (Monsters Inc.)|James P. Sullivan]], who he immediately becomes bitter rivals with, as Sullivan tells Wazowski he doesn\u2019t have a chance as a scarer.\n\nWazowski studies hard and excels, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, relies only on his natural ability and begins to falter. As the semester progresses, Wazowski and Sullivan attempt to join a [[fraternity]], but only Sullivan is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the most prestigious fraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, the two\u2019s rivalry escalates into a fight between them and causes them to accidentally break [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished scream canister; Hardscrabble fails them both on the spot, citing Wazowski's complete lack of scariness and Sullivan's laziness, to which Roar Omega Roar promptly expels Sullivan.\n\nWanting to prove himself, Wazowski enters the university's \"Scare Games\" and makes a deal with Hardscrabble: she will reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Wazowski must leave the university if they lose. He joins a fraternity of misfits named Oozma Kappa, consisting of nervous son Scott \"Squishy\" Squibbles, middle-aged president Don Carlton, polar-opposite twins Terri and Terry Perry who shares each other's body, and shaggy and big-legged Art, but they are initially denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. At first, Wazowski selects Boggs a part of Oozma Kappa, but he is part of Roar Omega Roar after Sullivan's expulsion. So Wazowski reluctantly lets Sullivan join them upon seeing the competition as his only way back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finishes last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination when Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective gel. Oozma Kappa improves gradually due to Wazowski's training and intricate knowledge of scaring and they advance through each following challenge, finishing second to Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Wazowski in the simulation bedroom. However, Wazowski discovers that he only won because Sulley secretly rigged the machine to give Wazowski a maximum score.\n\nDetermined to prove that he can become a scarer, Wazowski breaks into the school's door-making lab where he enters a door to the human world, but upon finding himself at a summer camp in a cabin full of children that aren't scared of him, he is forced to flee into the woods. Hardscrabble forbids anyone else from going through the door, but Sullivan sneaks through to rescue Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Wazowski realizes that the only way to escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sullivan and Wazowski terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy, returning to the lab seconds before the device overloads and explodes in front of a surprised Hardscrabble.\n\nSullivan and Wazowski are expelled from the university, while the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program for the next semester as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the Games. Carlton announces that he is going to marry Squibbles' mother, Sheri. As Wazowski leaves on the bus, Sullivan chases him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes them good luck, stating that they were the first students to have surprised her.\n\nSometime later, Oozma Kappa officially become Scarers at Monsters, Inc., Boggs leaves Roar Omega Roar and becomes a Scarer at Monsters, Inc., and Wazowski and Sullivan join the scare team. \n<!-- Please do not add post-credits scene here - thanks! -->\n\n==Cast==\n<!--If you add voice actors, you must provide official sources or it will be removed.-->\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 3\n| total_width = 300\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Billy Crystal VF 2012 Shankbone.JPG\n| width1 = 1534\n| caption1 = \n| height1 = 1917\n| image2 = John Goodman by David Shankbone.jpg\n| width2 = 1953\n| caption2 = \n| height2 = 2394\n| image3 = Steve Buscemi 2009 portrait.jpg\n| width3 = 2090\n| height3 = 3133\n| image4 = Helen Mirren 2014.jpg\n| width4 = 607\n| height4 = 770\n| image5 = Nathan Fillion by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width5 = 2358\n| height5 = 3096\n| image6 = AlfredMolinaByJustinHoch2009.jpg\n| width6 = 320\n| height6 = 472\n| footer = [[Billy Crystal]], [[John Goodman]], and [[Steve Buscemi]] ''(top)'' reprise their roles from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' while [[Helen Mirren]], [[Nathan Fillion]], and [[Alfred Molina]] ''(bottom)'' play new characters.\n}}\n{{main|List of Monsters, Inc. characters}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Mike Wazowski\n** Noah Johnston as Young Mike<ref name=\"first-prequel\">{{cite news|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=Producer Kori Rae Talks MONSTERS UNIVERSITY, Creating Pixar's First Prequel, Casting Helen Mirren, Crafting John Ratzenberger's Role and More|url= http://collider.com/kori-rae-monsters-university-interview/|accessdate=May 10, 2013|publisher=Collider.com|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[John Goodman]] as James P.

Eleven years later, Wazowski is now a first-year scare major at Monsters University (similar to Harvard University) where he meets [[Randall Boggs]], his roommate who he becomes immediate friends with, and [[James P. Sullivan (Monsters Inc.)|James P. Sullivan]], who he immediately becomes bitter rivals with, as Sullivan tells Wazowski he doesn\u2019t have a chance as a scarer.\n\nWazowski studies hard and excels, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, relies only on his natural ability and begins to falter. As the semester progresses, Wazowski and Sullivan attempt to join a [[fraternity]], but only Sullivan is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the most prestigious fraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, the two\u2019s rivalry escalates into a fight between them and causes them to accidentally break [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished scream canister; Hardscrabble fails them both on the spot, citing Wazowski's complete lack of scariness and Sullivan's laziness, to which Roar Omega Roar promptly expels Sullivan.\n\nWanting to prove himself, Wazowski enters the university's \"Scare Games\" and makes a deal with Hardscrabble: she will reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Wazowski must leave the university if they lose. He joins a fraternity of misfits named Oozma Kappa, consisting of nervous son Scott \"Squishy\" Squibbles, middle-aged president Don Carlton, polar-opposite twins Terri and Terry Perry who shares each other's body, and shaggy and big-legged Art, but they are initially denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. At first, Wazowski selects Boggs a part of Oozma Kappa, but he is part of Roar Omega Roar after Sullivan's expulsion. So Wazowski reluctantly lets Sullivan join them upon seeing the competition as his only way back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finishes last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination when Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective gel. Oozma Kappa improves gradually due to Wazowski's training and intricate knowledge of scaring and they advance through each following challenge, finishing second to Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Wazowski in the simulation bedroom. However, Wazowski discovers that he only won because Sulley secretly rigged the machine to give Wazowski a maximum score.\n\nDetermined to prove that he can become a scarer, Wazowski breaks into the school's door-making lab where he enters a door to the human world, but upon finding himself at a summer camp in a cabin full of children that aren't scared of him, he is forced to flee into the woods. Hardscrabble forbids anyone else from going through the door, but Sullivan sneaks through to rescue Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Wazowski realizes that the only way to escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sullivan and Wazowski terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy, returning to the lab seconds before the device overloads and explodes in front of a surprised Hardscrabble.\n\nSullivan and Wazowski are expelled from the university, while the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program for the next semester as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the Games.

Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]].\n\nTarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the [[screenplay]] ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.\n\nAn important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigory Chukhray]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhray offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.<ref name=\"kompravda\" />\n\nDuring his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script ''Antarctica \u2013 Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.\n\n==Career==\n===Film career in the Soviet Union===\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the year 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.\n[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]\nIn 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971. Nevertheless, the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles \u2013 a significant sum for that period.<ref name=\"latgale.academy\">{{cite web |url=https://latgale.academy/censorships-impact-on-tarkovskys-movies/ |title=Censorship's impact on Tarkovsky's movies |accessdate=26 July 2019 |work=latgale.academy}}</ref>\n\nHe divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larissa Kizilova]] (n\u00e9e Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (they had been living together since 1965).

He had worked on this together with screenwriter [[Fridrikh Gorenshtein]] as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the \"third category,\" a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<ref>Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2.

T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.\n\nThe last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen'''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book\n|script-title=ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u044f \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0410. \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0440. |trans-title=Andey Tarkovsky's world and films | publisher= Iskusstvo(\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) |year=1990 |location=Moscow |isbn=978-81-7046-083-1|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n===Film career outside the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Andrej Tarkovskij mug shot at Latina Refugee Camp 1985.jpg|thumb|right|Mug shot of Andrei Tarkovsky at the Latina Refugee Camp of [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] (Italy) in 1985]]\nDuring the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' together with his long-time friend [[Tonino Guerra]].

Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky.

''Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky'' is 1988 documentary film by [[Michal Leszczylowski]], an editor of the film ''The Sacrifice''.

The screenplay is based on the life and work of German author [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In 1974 an acquaintance from [[Tallinnfilm]] approached Tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a German theme. Tarkovsky considered [[Thomas Mann]] and E.T.A. Hoffmann, and also thought about [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. Tarkovsky planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his [[dacha]]. Writing was not without difficulty, less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page. He finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tallinnfilm in October.<ref name=wpowell>{{cite book\n  | last = Tarkovsky\n  | first = Andrei\n  | editor-first = William\n  | editor-last = Powell\n  | title = Collected Screenplays\n  | publisher = Faber & Faber\n  | year = 1999\n  | location = London\n  }}\n</ref>\n\nAlthough the script was well received by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it was the consensus that no one but Tarkovsky would be able to direct it. The script was sent to [[Goskino]] in February 1976, and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time of his exile in the West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes. He also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea.<ref name=\"wpowell\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nTarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period referred to as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other things. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience that influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.\n\nTarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |author2=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=978-5-01-001973-0 |access-date=26 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612085621/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |archive-date=12 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of [[Haiku]] and its ability to create \"images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves\".<ref>Tarkovsky, Andrei.

Among his favorite directors were Bu\u00f1uel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean Vigo]], and [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lasica |first=Tom |title=Tarkovsky's Choice |journal=Sight and Sound |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=March 1993 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |accessdate=25 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706074126/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |archivedate=6 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of ''City Lights'', the list does not contain any films of the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Parajanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly. He said of Dovzhenko's ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'': \"I have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people. They spread calmness, had such tact, they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that I have seldom come across on such a scale. Dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides. [...] This trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man. Dovzhenko understood this.\"{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=42\u201343}}\n\nAlthough strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying that its \"vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art\". He was critical of the \"brutality and low acting skills\", but was nevertheless impressed by the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==Cinematic style==\nIn a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued: \"All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be emotional and act upon the heart.\"{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=5}} His films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said: \"Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.\"\n\nTarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.<ref>{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=20 June 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804055107/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.<ref>{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808041231/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |archive-date=8 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bells and candles are also frequent symbols.

By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.\n\nUp to, and including, his film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.\n\nSeveral of Tarkovsky's films have color or black-and-white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Photographic print toning|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a \"commercial gimmick\" and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema \u2013 Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083703/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n; Bergman on Tarkovsky\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]], a renowned director, commented on Tarkovsky:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nostalghia.com/ |title=An Andrei Tarkovsky Information Site |last=Bielawski |first=Trond Trondsen and Jan |website=nostalghia.com |access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle.

During his career he directed seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. His features are:\n* ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' (1986)\n\nHe also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he then f directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.\n\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052531/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiaj\u0105 Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137\u2013160 |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |access-date=16 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116155850/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |archive-date=16 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nBooks written by Tarkovsky\n#''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', published in 1986\n#''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986|Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970'''''\u2013'''''1986]]'', published in 1989\n\nA book of 60 photos, ''Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids'', taken by Tarkovsky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006.

Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]].\n\nTarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the [[screenplay]] ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.\n\nAn important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigory Chukhray]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhray offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.<ref name=\"kompravda\" />\n\nDuring his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script ''Antarctica \u2013 Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.\n\n==Career==\n===Film career in the Soviet Union===\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the year 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.\n[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]\nIn 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971. Nevertheless, the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles \u2013 a significant sum for that period.<ref name=\"latgale.academy\">{{cite web |url=https://latgale.academy/censorships-impact-on-tarkovskys-movies/ |title=Censorship's impact on Tarkovsky's movies |accessdate=26 July 2019 |work=latgale.academy}}</ref>\n\nHe divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970.

The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the \"third category,\" a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<ref>Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2.

T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.\n\nThe last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen'''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book\n|script-title=ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u044f \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0410. \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0440. |trans-title=Andey Tarkovsky's world and films | publisher= Iskusstvo(\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) |year=1990 |location=Moscow |isbn=978-81-7046-083-1|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n===Film career outside the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Andrej Tarkovskij mug shot at Latina Refugee Camp 1985.jpg|thumb|right|Mug shot of Andrei Tarkovsky at the Latina Refugee Camp of [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] (Italy) in 1985]]\nDuring the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' together with his long-time friend [[Tonino Guerra]].

The inscription on his gravestone, which was conceived by Tarkovsky's wife, Larisa Tarkovskaya, reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''.\n\nA conspiracy theory emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]. Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.<ref>Komsolmoskaya Pravda, \"New Tarkovsky documents surface\", 15.

Tarkovsky considered [[Thomas Mann]] and E.T.A. Hoffmann, and also thought about [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. Tarkovsky planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his [[dacha]].

This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience that influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.\n\nTarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |author2=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=978-5-01-001973-0 |access-date=26 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612085621/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |archive-date=12 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of [[Haiku]] and its ability to create \"images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves\".<ref>Tarkovsky, Andrei.

He said of Dovzhenko's ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'': \"I have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people. They spread calmness, had such tact, they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that I have seldom come across on such a scale. Dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides. [...] This trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man. Dovzhenko understood this.\"{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=42\u201343}}\n\nAlthough strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying that its \"vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art\". He was critical of the \"brutality and low acting skills\", but was nevertheless impressed by the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==Cinematic style==\nIn a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued: \"All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be emotional and act upon the heart.\"{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=5}} His films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said: \"Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.\"\n\nTarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.<ref>{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=20 June 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804055107/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.<ref>{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808041231/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |archive-date=8 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bells and candles are also frequent symbols.

By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.\n\nUp to, and including, his film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.\n\nSeveral of Tarkovsky's films have color or black-and-white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Photographic print toning|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a \"commercial gimmick\" and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema \u2013 Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083703/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n; Bergman on Tarkovsky\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]], a renowned director, commented on Tarkovsky:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nostalghia.com/ |title=An Andrei Tarkovsky Information Site |last=Bielawski |first=Trond Trondsen and Jan |website=nostalghia.com |access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle.

(Nykvist was not alone: several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with Bergman, notably lead actor [[Erland Josephson]], who had also acted for Tarkovsky in ''[[Nostalghia]]''.) Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it.<ref name=\"Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79\"/>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{main|Andrei Tarkovsky filmography}}\nTarkovsky is mainly known as a film director. During his career he directed seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. His features are:\n* ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' (1986)\n\nHe also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.\n\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052531/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiaj\u0105 Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137\u2013160 |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |access-date=16 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116155850/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |archive-date=16 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nBooks written by Tarkovsky\n#''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', published in 1986\n#''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986|Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970'''''\u2013'''''1986]]'', published in 1989\n\nA book of 60 photos, ''Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids'', taken by Tarkovsky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006.
