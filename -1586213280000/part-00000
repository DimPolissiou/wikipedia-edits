The song lyrics often feature themes of [[romantic love]] and personal happiness, with references to sunshine, platonic love, toys, colors, nonsense words, etc. They are also notable for their frequent reference to sugary food, including sugar, honey, butterscotch, jelly and marmalade. [[Marketing co-operation|Cross-marketing]] with cereal and bubblegum manufacturers also strengthened the link between bubblegum songs and [[confectionery]]. [[Cardboard record]]s by [[the Archies]], [[the Banana Splits]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[the Monkees]], [[Bobby Sherman]], [[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]], [[H.R. Pufnstuf]] and other acts were included on the backs of cereal boxes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while acts including [[The Brady Bunch]] had their own brands of chewing gum as a result of licensing deals with TV networks and record companies.<ref name=\"naked\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nProducers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] have claimed credit for coining the term ''bubblegum pop'', saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was seized upon by [[Buddah Records]] label executive [[Neil Bogart]]. Music writer and bubblegum historian Bill Pitzonka confirmed the claim, telling ''Goldmine'' magazine: \"That's when bubblegum crystallized into an actual camp. Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized it when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\"<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n==History==\nThe birth of bubblegum is generally dated from the success of [[The Lemon Pipers]]' psychedelic bubblegum hit \"[[Green Tambourine]]\" (1967), [[1910 Fruitgum Company]]'s \"[[Simon Says (1910 Fruitgum Company song)|Simon Says]]\" (1968) and [[The Ohio Express]]' \"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\" (1968), but music critics have identified [[novelty song]]s including  [[The Dixie Cups]]' \"[[Iko Iko]]\" (1965), [[Patti Page]]'s \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\" (1953) and the hits of Annette Funicello as possible precursors.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nA breeding ground for the genre has also been found in the field of 1960s [[garage rock]], the songs of which shared an overriding simplicity with bubblegum. Garage and bubblegum groups were also both generally [[single (music)|singles]] acts. Several garage punk bands, including [[Shadows of Knight]], later recorded bubblegum tracks, while Ohio Express, one of the major 1960s bubblegum bands, began their recording career with punk-rooted tunes.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nBetween those two camps emerged [[Florida]] group [[The Royal Guardsmen]], who scored a US No. 2 hit in 1966 with their novelty hit \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\", and [[The Fifth Estate (band)|The Fifth Estate]], whose 1967 song \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\" reached No. 11 in the US.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n[[Tommy James and the Shondells]] are also seen as a major influence, with such songs as 1964's \"[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]\", 1966's \"It's Only Love\", and 1967's \"[[I Think We're Alone Now]]\" and \"[[Gettin' Together (song)|Gettin' Together]]\", but critics are divided on one possible major bubblegum band prototype: [[The Monkees]]. Although the band began as a prefabricated, fictional rock group concocted to sell records and TV advertising time, the band later wrested creative control from their creators.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\nThe success of the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine\" (US No. 1, February 1968, produced by [[Paul Leka]]) was followed by a wave of bubblegum delivered by the [[Super K Productions]] team of Kasenetz and Katz, who had scored their first hits in 1967 with the [[Music Explosion]]'s \"[[Little Bit O' Soul]]\" (No. 2, May) and [[The Ohio Express]]'s \"Beg, Borrow and Steal\" (No. 29, October).\n\n[[Image:Joey Levine Caravan XV 3684f.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Joey Levine in concert, May 17, 2008]]\nIn early 1968, the pair signed [[New Jersey]] band Jekyll and the Hydes, changed the band's name to 1910 Fruitgum Company, and released two singles that made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] \u2013 \"Simon Says\" (No. 4, February 1968) and \"May I Take a Giant Step (Into Your Heart)\" (No. 63). In May 1968, The Ohio Express (who had also undergone an enforced name change under the Super K team's tutelage, from Sir Timothy and the Royals) also scored a No. 4 hit with \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\".\n\nThe latter, written by early twentysomething [[Joey Levine]] and accomplished songwriter [[Artie Resnick]], was intended as a demo for Ohio Express to emulate, featuring vocals by non-band member Levine and backing by session musicians. The song was released as an Ohio Express single without Levine's knowledge. Two follow-ups, \"Down at Lulu's\" (No. 33, August 1968) and \"Chewy Chewy\" (No. 15, October 1968), also charted \u2013 both featuring vocals by Levine (who had never met the band), and neither featuring any members of Ohio Express. The real Ohio Express toured, supporting [[The Who]] and [[Herman's Hermits]], with bassist Dean Kastran performing the vocals for the hits, emulating Levine's nasal-punk singing style.<ref name=\"naked\" />\n\nKasenetz and Katz developed a strong relationship with [[Buddah Records]], releasing a series of hits by 1910 Fruitgum Company, Ohio Express and one-offs such as \"Quick Joey Small\" by [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]], a Levine-fronted group of studio players. Kasenetz and Katz also scored on [[Bell Records]] in early 1969 with \"[[Gimme Gimme Good Lovin']]\" by another manufactured band, [[Crazy Elephant]].\n\nThe dominance of the Kasenetz\u2013Katz team was challenged in 1969 by music publisher [[Don Kirshner]] and \"Hanky Panky\"'s co-author, [[Brill Building]] writer/producer [[Jeff Barry]].  In early 1967, after almost a year of success directing the music team behind made-for-TV pop band [[The Monkees]], the band rebelled against Kirshner's strict creative controls and after an acrimonious confrontation, involving lawyers and physical violence, wrested control of their career from Kirshner.\n\nA battered and resentful Kirshner envisioned a manufactured group over which he could have permanent and total control: [[Filmation]]'s cartoon band [[The Archies]], based on the [[Archie Comics]] characters. He enlisted Barry and [[Andy Kim]] as songwriters, session musicians including [[Hugh McCracken]], [[Gary Chester]], [[Chuck Rainey]], [[Sal DiTroia]], and Ron Frangipane to provide the music and [[Ron Dante]] and [[Toni Wine]] as vocalists.<ref>email from the late Sal DiTroia, identifying himself and Hugh McCracked as guitarists on \"Sugar, Sugar\"</ref><ref>Liner notes to ''Absolutely the Best of The Archies'' (Fuel 2000, 2001.</ref> Dante, also of [[the Cuff Links]], with whom he scored a No. 9 bubblegum hit, \"[[Tracy (The Cuff Links song)|Tracy]]\", during the same period, would go on later to produce hits for [[Barry Manilow]] in the early 1970s.  The fictional band's \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\" (a song Kirshner may have earlier offered to the Monkees, though the claim is disputed)<ref>{{cite book|title=Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent cancer, From the Banana Splits to Britney Spears|last=|first=|publisher=Feral House|year=2001|isbn=0-922915-69-5|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Kim|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77 77]|editor-last2=Smay|editor-first2=David|url=https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77}}</ref> was the best-selling single of 1969, and the band would score five other Hot 100 singles, including \"[[Bang-Shang-A-Lang]]\", \"[[Jingle Jangle (The Archies song)|Jingle Jangle]]\", and \"[[Who's Your Baby]]\".\n\nOther cartoon bands appeared during 1968\u201372 in response to the Archies' success.  Cartoon producers [[Hanna-Barbera]] created [[The Banana Splits]], which made its debut one week before ''[[The Archie Show]]'' in September 1968, for a Saturday morning cartoon show featuring costumed actors miming to pre-recorded tracks \u00e0 la the early Monkees.  Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' was originally developed as cartoon band show, but even after that idea was dropped, the second season in 1970 included seven episodes that each used a different bubblegum song for extended chase scenes with each performed by [[Austin Roberts (singer)|Austin Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Scooby-Doos-Snack-Tracks-The-Ultimate-Collection/release/3375064|publisher=[[Discogs]]|title=Scooby-Doo's Snack Tracks: The Ultimate Collection}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' became the studio's new cartoon band show.\n\nOther animated acts featuring bubblegum music included [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'', and ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'', ''Sugar Bears'', and (in the UK) ''[[The Wombles]]''.  The all-simian bubblegum band [[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp#The Evolution Revolution|Evolution Revolution]] appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'' from 1970 to 1972 featuring vocals by Steve Hoffman, and studio musicians from [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]] providing backup on their sole LP release.\n\n[[Sesame Workshop]], then called Children's Television Workshop, also jumped on the bubblegum bandwagon, first with a muppet group called \"Little Jerry and the Monotones\" on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in its second season, and then with a juvenile group called \"The Short Circus\" from its new series, ''[[The Electric Company]]'', who would also double as kid cast members in various sketches in the show.\n\nThe initial era of bubblegum carried on into the early 1970s, with hits from [[The Cowsills]],  [[The Partridge Family]] (a made-for-TV group inspired by the real-life Cowsills, starring [[Shirley Jones]] and featuring [[David Cassidy]]), [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Osmonds]], [[The DeFranco Family]] featuring [[Tony DeFranco]] and others. Many [[United Kingdom|British]] acts of the first [[glam rock]] era (approximately 1971\u201375) also incorporated bubblegum influences,<ref name=\"goldmine\" /> including [[Gary Glitter]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and such [[Nicky Chinn]]/[[Mike Chapman]]-produced acts as [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], and American expatriate [[Suzi Quatro]]. These acts had great success in the UK, Asia, Europe and Australia, charting many singles. They were less successful in the US, however. One English bubblegum-pop singer who did achieve transcontinental success was session singer [[Tony Burrows]], but never under his own name: every hit on which Burrows sang lead was credited to a different group (among them White Plains, Edison Lighthouse, The First Class, and The Brotherhood of Man, as well as his novelty recording \"Gimme Dat Ding\" with The Pipkins).\n\nBubblegum had a resurgence, however, and maintained a minor presence on the US charts in the mid-to-late 1970s, particularly through [[Shaun Cassidy]] (David's half-brother) and [[Leif Garrett]], both of whom also maintained television acting careers. The last big act of the 1970s featuring obvious bubblegum elements was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] band the [[Bay City Rollers]], who charted from 1975 through 1978.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sunshine pop]]\n* [[Teenybopper]]\n* [[Bubblegum dance]]\n* [[Teen pop]]\n* [[1960s in music]]\n* [[J-pop]]\n* [[K-pop]]\n* [[Y\u00e9-y\u00e9]]\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bubblegum-music.com Bubblegum University, a group blog dedicated to bubblegum scholarship]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608035837/http://home.comcast.net/~bubblegumusic/ The Classic Bubblegum Music Home Page, Bubblegum articles, interviews, history, lyrics, and reviews]\n* [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=Top+Kid+Audio Billboard Top Kid Audio Chart]\n\n{{Pop music}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bubblegum Pop}}\n[[Category:Bubblegum pop| ]]\n[[Category:Pop music genres]]\n[[Category:Rock music genres]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox music genre <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Music genres -->\n| name              = Bubblegum pop\n| bgcolor           = #87CEEB <!--Please DO NOT CHANGE the background or text color of this infobox without discussion; pop genre infoboxes are to be light blue with black text per Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Music genres task force/Colours. -->\n| color             = black\n| stylistic_origins = {{hlist|[[Pop music|Pop]]|[[pop rock]]|[[garage rock]]|[[novelty song]]s|[[nursery rhyme]]s|[[children's music]]|[[comedy music]]}}\n| cultural_origins  = Mid- to late 1960s, United States\n| instruments       = {{hlist|[[Vocals]]|[[synthesizer]]|[[bass guitar]]|[[drum machine]]|[[drums]]|[[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]|[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]|[[guitar]]}}\n| derivatives       = {{hlist|[[Boy band]]s|[[pop punk]]|[[Europop]]|[[dance-pop]]|[[teen pop]]|[[indie pop]]|[[glam rock]]|[[noise pop]]|[[bubblegum dance]]|[[new wave]]}}\n| subgenrelist      =\n| subgenres         =\n| fusiongenres      =\n| regional_scenes   =\n| other_topics      = {{hlist|[[Eurovision Song Contest]]|[[camp (style)|camp]]|''[[Pop Idol]]''|[[teenybopper]]|[[K-pop]]}}\n}}\n'''Bubblegum pop''' (also known as '''bubblegum music''' or simply '''bubblegum''') is a genre of music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to [[pre-teen]]s and [[teenager]]s, which may be produced in an [[assembly-line]] process, driven by [[music producer|producers]] and often using unknown singers.

In early 1967, after almost a year of success directing the music team behind made-for-TV pop band [[The Monkees]], the band rebelled against Kirshner's strict creative controls and after an acrimonious confrontation, involving lawyers and physical violence, wrested control of their career from Kirshner.\n\nA battered and resentful Kirshner envisioned a manufactured group over which he could have permanent and total control: [[Filmation]]'s cartoon band [[The Archies]], based on the [[Archie Comics]] characters. He enlisted Barry and [[Andy Kim]] as songwriters, session musicians including [[Hugh McCracken]], [[Gary Chester]], [[Chuck Rainey]], [[Sal DiTroia]], and Ron Frangipane to provide the music and [[Ron Dante]] and [[Toni Wine]] as vocalists.<ref>email from the late Sal DiTroia, identifying himself and Hugh McCracked as guitarists on \"Sugar, Sugar\"</ref><ref>Liner notes to ''Absolutely the Best of The Archies'' (Fuel 2000, 2001.</ref> Dante, also of [[the Cuff Links]], with whom he scored a No. 9 bubblegum hit, \"[[Tracy (The Cuff Links song)|Tracy]]\", during the same period, would go on later to produce hits for [[Barry Manilow]] in the early 1970s.  The fictional band's \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\" (a song Kirshner may have earlier offered to the Monkees, though the claim is disputed)<ref>{{cite book|title=Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent cancer, From the Banana Splits to Britney Spears|last=|first=|publisher=Feral House|year=2001|isbn=0-922915-69-5|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Kim|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77 77]|editor-last2=Smay|editor-first2=David|url=https://archive.org/details/bubblegummusicis0000unse/page/77}}</ref> was the best-selling single of 1969, and the band would score five other Hot 100 singles, including \"[[Bang-Shang-A-Lang]]\", \"[[Jingle Jangle (The Archies song)|Jingle Jangle]]\", and \"[[Who's Your Baby]]\".\n\nOther cartoon bands appeared during 1968\u201372 in response to the Archies' success.  Cartoon producers [[Hanna-Barbera]] created [[The Banana Splits]], which made its debut one week before ''[[The Archie Show]]'' in September 1968, for a Saturday morning cartoon show featuring costumed actors miming to pre-recorded tracks \u00e0 la the early Monkees.  Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' was originally developed as cartoon band show, but even after that idea was dropped, the second season in 1970 included seven episodes that each used a different bubblegum song for extended chase scenes with each performed by [[Austin Roberts (singer)|Austin Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Scooby-Doos-Snack-Tracks-The-Ultimate-Collection/release/3375064|publisher=[[Discogs]]|title=Scooby-Doo's Snack Tracks: The Ultimate Collection}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' became the studio's new cartoon band show.\n\nOther animated acts featuring bubblegum music included [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'', and ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'', ''Sugar Bears'', and (in the UK) ''[[The Wombles]]''.  The all-simian bubblegum band [[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp#The Evolution Revolution|Evolution Revolution]] appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'' from 1970 to 1972 featuring vocals by Steve Hoffman, and studio musicians from [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]] providing backup on their sole LP release.\n\n[[Sesame Workshop]], then called Children's Television Workshop, also jumped on the bubblegum bandwagon, first with a muppet group called \"Little Jerry and the Monotones\" on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in its second season, and then with a juvenile group called \"The Short Circus\" from its new series, ''[[The Electric Company]]'', who would also double as kid cast members in various sketches in the show.\n\nThe initial era of bubblegum carried on into the early 1970s, with hits from [[The Cowsills]],  [[The Partridge Family]] (a made-for-TV group inspired by the real-life Cowsills, starring [[Shirley Jones]] and featuring [[David Cassidy]]), [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Osmonds]], [[The DeFranco Family]] featuring [[Tony DeFranco]] and others. Many [[United Kingdom|British]] acts of the first [[glam rock]] era (approximately 1971\u201375) also incorporated bubblegum influences,<ref name=\"goldmine\" /> including [[Gary Glitter]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and such [[Nicky Chinn]]/[[Mike Chapman]]-produced acts as [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], and American expatriate [[Suzi Quatro]]. These acts had great success in the UK, Asia, Europe and Australia, charting many singles. They were less successful in the US, however. One English bubblegum-pop singer who did achieve transcontinental success was session singer [[Tony Burrows]], but never under his own name: every hit on which Burrows sang lead was credited to a different group (among them White Plains, Edison Lighthouse, The First Class, and The Brotherhood of Man, as well as his novelty recording \"Gimme Dat Ding\" with The Pipkins).\n\nBubblegum had a resurgence, however, and maintained a minor presence on the US charts in the mid-to-late 1970s, particularly through [[Shaun Cassidy]] (David's half-brother) and [[Leif Garrett]], both of whom also maintained television acting careers. The last big act of the 1970s featuring obvious bubblegum elements was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] band the [[Bay City Rollers]], who charted from 1975 through 1978.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sunshine pop]]\n* [[Teenybopper]]\n* [[Bubblegum dance]]\n* [[Teen pop]]\n* [[1960s in music]]\n* [[J-pop]]\n* [[K-pop]]\n* [[Y\u00e9-y\u00e9]]\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bubblegum-music.com Bubblegum University, a group blog dedicated to bubblegum scholarship]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608035837/http://home.comcast.net/~bubblegumusic/ The Classic Bubblegum Music Home Page, Bubblegum articles, interviews, history, lyrics, and reviews]\n* [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=Top+Kid+Audio Billboard Top Kid Audio Chart]\n\n{{Pop music}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bubblegum Pop}}\n[[Category:Bubblegum pop| ]]\n[[Category:Pop music genres]]\n[[Category:Rock music genres]]\n", "name_user": "2600:8804:8840:1460:40ed:845f:34fc:3ce6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Good)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_pop"}

For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nSurfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process such as environmental remediation and enhanced oil recovery applications,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohammadnejad|first=Hamed|last2=Liao|first2=Shuchi|last3=Marion|first3=Bonnie A.|last4=Pennell|first4=Kurt D|last5=Abriola|first5=Linda M.|date=2020-03-27|title=Development and validation of a two-stage kinetic sorption model for polymer and surfactant transport in porous media|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c00123|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|language=en|pages=acs.est.0c00123|doi=10.1021/acs.est.0c00123|issn=0013-936X}}</ref> or as industrial and household waste.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&nbsp;\u2013 NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].\n\n===Quantum dot preparation===\nSurfactants are used with [[quantum dot]]s in order to manipulate growth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Monodisperse Nanocrystals and Close-Packed Nanocrystal Assemblies |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=545\u2013610 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.545|bibcode = 2000AnRMS..30..545M |last1=Murray |first1=C.

For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network.

A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup.
