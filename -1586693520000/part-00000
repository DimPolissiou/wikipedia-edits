In the 17th century Nevers was then a pioneer in imitating Asian ceramic styles in Europe, within some decades followed by all producers of fine wares.  The second half of the 17th century was Nevers' finest period, with several styles being made at the same time, including a grandiose Italianate Court style.<ref>McNab, 20-21; [http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1156287/jardiniere-unknown/ V&A, Nevers] [[Jardiniere]]</ref>   \n\nBy the time of the [[French Revolution]] Nevers wares had ceased to be fashionable and expensive,<ref>Garnier, 274\u2013275</ref> but the relatively crudely painted ''faiences patriotiques'' wares commenting on political events have great interest and charm.<ref>Though not to Garnier, 275, who is very rude about them</ref>  A late 19th-century revival concentrated on high-quality revivalist wares recreating past glories.    \n \n==History==\nThe tradition owes its origin to [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]] (1539\u20131595), a half-French and half Italian politician and courtier who married the heiress of the [[Duke of Nevers|Duchy of Nevers]], which then still gave him great powers in the [[County and Duchy of Nevers]].  He had been born in [[Mantua]], near several centres for Italian [[maiolica]], which had already spread to [[Rouen]] and [[Lyons]], and encouraged some Italian potters to move to the city.  Giulio Gambin was already in Lyons and the Conrade brothers (Corrado in Italy) came from [[Albisola]], who would found the dynasty that dominated Nevers production for a century.<ref>Coutts, 28; Moon; McNab, 12; Britannica</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=173}}</ref>   \n\nNevers already had a local unglazed pottery industry, and was a very suitable location for making faience. The city was near deposits of excellent pottery clay, an exceptionally good type of sand for making [[ceramic glaze]], forests for wood for the kilns, and was on the major [[Loire]] river.  The earliest dated piece by the Italians is from 1587.<ref>Estienne, 46</ref> \n\nIn 1603 the brothers received a monopoly from [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] for the making of wares in the style of [[Faenza]], whether painted polychrome or with white grounds, and a generation later Antoine Conrade, son of Dominique, was made ''faiencier ordinaire'' to the young [[Louis XIV]] in 1644.<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328</ref>  This was repeated in the next generation for another Dominique Conrade, given his ''brevet'' in 1672.<ref>Garnier, 270</ref>\n[[File:Nevers7.JPG|thumb|''faience patriotique'' of the [[French Revolution]]. An aristocrat and bishop: \"Unhappiness re-unites us\", 1791.]]\n\nThe Conrade monopoly was not effective for long, with a second factory starting in 1632, and by 1652 there were four different potteries in Nevers, including one founded by Pierre Custode, whose family became the other main Nevers dynasty of potters.<ref>Garnier, 270; Chaffers, 148</ref>  \n\nThe French faience industry received a huge boost when, late in his reign in 1709, [[Louis XIV]] pressured the wealthy to donate their silver plate, previously what they normally used to dine, to his treasury to help pay for his wars.  They was an \"overnight frenzy\" as the elite rushed to get faience replacements of the best quality.  Nevers garden vases in blue and white were prominently used in the gardens of the [[Chateau de Versailles]].<ref>Moon; McNab, 30</ref>\n\nThe success of the wares led to several other factories opening in the early 18th century, and in 1743 the government limited the number to eleven, to prevent flooding the market.  In 1760 a twelfth was permitted.  By this period Nevers wares had been largely replaced at the top end of the market by other makers, but were producing large quantities of less expensive wares for a broader market.  They did not attempt to compete with the elegant [[Rococo]] style of the French porcelain factories, which was attempted rather successfully by some makers of faience, for example the [[Veuve Perrin]] factory in [[Marseilles]].  All twelve Nevers factories (still including the Conrade and Custode ateliers) were still in operation in 1790, but a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786 led to the French market being flooded by cheaper and better English [[creamware]]s, leading to crisis for all French manufacturers of faience, and by 1797 six had ceased operations, with the other six having reduced their workforce by half.<ref>Chaffers, 148\u2013149, who lists all 12; Badillet, 4; Osborne, 133; Britannica</ref>  \n\nBy this time European [[porcelain]] was becoming cheaper and more reliable, and making life difficult for producers of high-quality earthenware across Europe.<ref>Osborne, 133; Moon</ref>  The Nevers response was to produce topical ''faiences patriotiques'' with which the English were unlikely to compete (although they had done excellent business supplying the new American republic with patriotic wares).<ref>Britannica</ref>\n[[File:Manufacture du bout du monde, Sainte C\u00e9cile.jpg|thumb|Montagon plate with [[Saint Cecilia]], 1888]]\n\nIn 1838 700 workers were reported to be employed,<ref>de Saint-Fargeau, Girault, ''Guide pittoresque du voyageur en France: contenant la statistique ...'', Volume 2, 11, 1838, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yQxAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA7 google books]</ref> but by 1846 only six factories remained, and by 1850 five.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref>  A [[porcelain]] manufactury in Nevers was also mentioned in 1844 by [[Alexandre Brongniart]], but little is known about it.<ref name=\"Litchfield\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsbMKOjvWiAC&pg=PA219 ''Pottery and Porcelain: A Guide to Collectors'' by Frederick Litchfield p.219]</ref>\n\nThe ''manufacture du Bout du monde'' (\"End of the World\" factory) was founded in 1648, and followed the general pattern of the Nevers factories.

The locations of the group are described in note 6 on p. 47 - examples outside France appear to have been ignored completely.</ref>  \n\n===Italian style===\nThe Italian immigrants continued at Nevers the ''istoriato'' (narrative) style that was already in decline in Italy, until at least 1660. As was usual in Italy by 1580, designs were mostly adapted from [[old master print|prints]],<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328; McNab, 12</ref> and the outline set out on the pot by a ''ponci'' or [[stencil]], pushing charcoal dust through pin-pricks in a paper drawing or tracing from a print.<ref>McNab, 12</ref>  \n\nThe early pieces did not generally use distinctive marks or inscriptions, though sometimes painting \"Nevers\" on the base of important pieces, perhaps with a date \u2013 the earliest of these is 1589, on a dish in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Coutts, 28</ref>  As with painted [[Limoges enamel]] of the previous century, with which Nevers decoration has some similaritites, a high proportion of religious subjects illustrate [[Old Testament]] subjects.  As with Italian pieces, the subjects, especially those from the Old Testament or [[classical mythology]], tended to be named on the base, sometimes even with the bible chapter noted.<ref>Wilson, 202 for an Italian example; [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194297 Metropolitan Museum page] for the \"Joseph and his brothers\" plate illustrated here.</ref>  \n\nThere is a good deal of uncertainty in the attribution of pieces between the Nevers workshops, and between Nevers pieces and those of other centres.<ref>Chaffers, 149, 151\u2013153 has an illustrated list of marks</ref>  The large dish with ''The Gathering of Manna'' illustrated below, a well-known piece, had been assumed to be Italian, and 16th century, until recently.

This was then painted in white or other colours, using various styles.  This style is traditionally known as \"Persian\", as decoration in white on a rich blue ground is often seen in [[Persian pottery]] of the period.  However the bird and flower painted decoration seen in most examples of the \"Persian\" style in fact derives more from Turkish [[Iznik pottery]], which  was reaching Europe through Italy.<ref>McNab, 18-20, 30 no 12; Estienne, 57</ref>   \n\nNevers adopted Chinese vase shapes early in the 17th century, earlier than Dutch [[Delftware]].<ref>McNab, 18</ref>  Some Nevers pieces clearly copy [[Chinese export porcelain]] in terms of their painted decoration, both the cheaper [[Kraak ware]] and better quality blue and white wares, whereas others have decoration based on Turkish, Persian or other Islamic Middle Eastern styles. These often have the blue background, which is unusual on Chinese export porcelain, where blue figures on a white ground are the norm in blue and white wares.<ref>McNab, 18\u201320; Estienne, 57-59</ref><ref name=\"Ward\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&pg=PA38 ''The Grove encyclopedia of materials and techniques in art'' Gerald W.

They compare with some much earlier [[Song dynasty]] wares, in particular the \"oil-spot\" glazes of [[Jian ware]] (around the 12th or 13th centuries), though Estienne is unable to explain how awareness of these could have reached France in the 17th century.<ref>Estienne, 60</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Assiette Nevers Conrade S\u00e8vres.jpg|Conrade plate, 1630s, imitating Chinese [[Kraak ware]]. \nFile:GardenVaseNevers-BMA (cropped).jpg|Garden vase, 1660-80; Chinese-style decor in white on a blue ground; the shape is entirely European. \nFile:Ariana museum - islamic pottery imitation - Plat - Nevers (France) - 1670 - 1680 - Inventaire AR 12748-2.jpg|\"Persian\"-style with ''bleu de Nevers'' ground, 1670s\nFile:Faience with Chinese scenes Nevers Manufactory 1680 1700.jpg|Chinese style, 1680-1700, blue on a white ground.\nFile:Nevers faience vases circa 1700.jpg|Chinese-style vases, c. 1700  \n\n</gallery>\n\n===Louis XIV Court style===\nAfter about 1650, Nevers adapted the new French Court style to faience, borrowing from metalwork and other decorative arts, and using prints after the new generation of court painters such as [[Simon Vouet]] and [[Charles Lebrun]] for the images.

After about 1750 the European porcelain factories largely replaced Asian exports as the dominant wares at the top of the market, but by this time Nevers faience was usually cruder, cheaper, and more \"popular\" in taste.  Some [[armorial porcelain|armorial wares]] were produced.<ref>McNab, 16</ref>  Nevers is on the [[Loire]] and many pieces have painted images of the local style of river boats, and the long arched bridge over the river.<ref>Badillet, Chapter 4 onwards</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century a favourite source for scenes with figures was the immensely long pastoral novel or romance ''[[L'Astr\u00e9e]]'' by [[Honor\u00e9 d'Urf\u00e9]], published between 1607 and 1627, and possibly the single most influential work of 17th century French literature.

In the 17th century Nevers was then a pioneer in imitating Asian ceramic styles in Europe, within some decades followed by all producers of fine wares.  The second half of the 17th century was Nevers' finest period, with several styles being made at the same time, including a grandiose Italianate Court style.<ref>McNab, 20-21; [http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1156287/jardiniere-unknown/ V&A, Nevers] [[Jardiniere]]</ref>   \n\nBy the time of the [[French Revolution]] Nevers wares had ceased to be fashionable and expensive,<ref>Garnier, 274\u2013275</ref> but the relatively crudely painted ''faiences patriotiques'' wares commenting on political events have great interest and charm.<ref>Though not to Garnier, 275, who is very rude about them</ref>  A late 19th-century revival concentrated on high-quality revivalist wares recreating past glories.    \n \n==History==\nThe tradition owes its origin to [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]] (1539\u20131595), a half-French and half Italian politician and courtier who married the heiress of the [[Duke of Nevers|Duchy of Nevers]], which then still gave him great powers in the [[County and Duchy of Nevers]].  He had been born in [[Mantua]], near several centres for Italian [[maiolica]], which had already spread to [[Rouen]] and [[Lyons]], and encouraged some Italian potters to move to the city.  Giulio Gambin was already in Lyons and the Conrade brothers (Corrado in Italy) came from [[Albisola]], who would found the dynasty that dominated Nevers production for a century.<ref>Coutts, 28; Moon; McNab, 12; Britannica</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=173}}</ref>   \n\nNevers already had a local unglazed pottery industry, and was a very suitable location for making faience. The city was near deposits of excellent pottery clay, an exceptionally good type of sand for making [[ceramic glaze]], forests for wood for the kilns, and was on the major [[Loire]] river.  The earliest dated piece by the Italians is from 1587.<ref>Estienne, 46</ref> \n\nIn 1603 the brothers received a monopoly from [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] for the making of wares in the style of [[Faenza]], whether painted polychrome or with white grounds, and a generation later Antoine Conrade, son of Dominique, was made ''faiencier ordinaire'' to the young [[Louis XIV]] in 1644.<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328</ref>  This was repeated in the next generation for another Dominique Conrade, given his ''brevet'' in 1672.<ref>Garnier, 270</ref>\n[[File:Nevers7.JPG|thumb|''faience patriotique'' of the [[French Revolution]]. An aristocrat and bishop: \"Unhappiness re-unites us\", 1791.]]\n\nThe Conrade monopoly was not effective for long, with a second factory starting in 1632, and by 1652 there were four different potteries in Nevers, including one founded by Pierre Custode, whose family became the other main Nevers dynasty of potters.<ref>Garnier, 270; Chaffers, 148</ref>  \n\nThe French faience industry received a huge boost when, late in his reign in 1709, [[Louis XIV]] pressured the wealthy to donate their silver plate, previously what they normally used to dine, to his treasury to help pay for his wars.  They was an \"overnight frenzy\" as the elite rushed to get faience replacements of the best quality.  Nevers garden vases in blue and white were prominently used in the gardens of the [[Chateau de Versailles]].<ref>Moon; McNab, 30</ref>\n\nThe success of the wares led to several other factories opening in the early 18th century, and in 1743 the government limited the number to eleven, to prevent flooding the market.  In 1760 a twelfth was permitted.  By this period Nevers wares had been largely replaced at the top end of the market by other makers, but were producing large quantities of less expensive wares for a broader market.  They did not attempt to compete with the elegant [[Rococo]] style of the French porcelain factories, which was attempted rather successfully by some makers of faience, for example the [[Veuve Perrin]] factory in [[Marseilles]].  All twelve Nevers factories (still including the Conrade and Custode ateliers) were still in operation in 1790, but a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786 led to the French market being flooded by cheaper and better English [[creamware]]s, leading to crisis for all French manufacturers of faience, and by 1797 six had ceased operations, with the other six having reduced their workforce by half.<ref>Chaffers, 148\u2013149, who lists all 12; Badillet, 4; Osborne, 133; Britannica</ref>  \n\nBy this time European [[porcelain]] was becoming cheaper and more reliable, and making life difficult for producers of high-quality earthenware across Europe.<ref>Osborne, 133; Moon</ref>  The Nevers response was to produce topical ''faiences patriotiques'' with which the English were unlikely to compete (although they had done excellent business supplying the new American republic with patriotic wares).<ref>Britannica</ref>\n[[File:Manufacture du bout du monde, Sainte C\u00e9cile.jpg|thumb|Montagon plate with [[Saint Cecilia]], 1888]]\n\nIn 1838 700 workers were reported to be employed,<ref>de Saint-Fargeau, Girault, ''Guide pittoresque du voyageur en France: contenant la statistique ...'', Volume 2, 11, 1838, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yQxAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA7 google books]</ref> but by 1846 only six factories remained, and by 1850 five.<ref>Badillet, 4</ref>  A [[porcelain]] manufactury in Nevers was also mentioned in 1844 by [[Alexandre Brongniart]], but little is known about it.<ref name=\"Litchfield\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsbMKOjvWiAC&pg=PA219 ''Pottery and Porcelain: A Guide to Collectors'' by Frederick Litchfield p.219]</ref>\n\nThe ''manufacture du Bout du monde'' (\"End of the World\" factory) was founded in 1648, and followed the general pattern of the Nevers factories.

The locations of the group are described in note 6 on p. 47 - examples outside France appear to have been ignored completely.</ref>  \n\n===Italian style===\nThe Italian immigrants continued at Nevers the ''istoriato'' (narrative) style that was already in decline in Italy, until at least 1660. As was usual in Italy by 1580, designs were mostly adapted from [[old master print|prints]],<ref>Coutts, 27\u201328; McNab, 12</ref> and the outline set out on the pot by a ''ponci'' or [[stencil]], pushing charcoal dust through pin-pricks in a paper drawing or tracing from a print.<ref>McNab, 12</ref>  \n\nThe early pieces did not generally use distinctive marks or inscriptions, though sometimes painting \"Nevers\" on the base of important pieces, perhaps with a date \u2013 the earliest of these is 1589, on a dish in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Coutts, 28</ref>  As with painted [[Limoges enamel]] of the previous century, with which Nevers decoration has some similaritites, a high proportion of religious subjects illustrate [[Old Testament]] subjects.  As with Italian pieces, the subjects, especially those from the Old Testament or [[classical mythology]], tended to be named on the base, sometimes even with the bible chapter noted.<ref>Wilson, 202 for an Italian example; [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194297 Metropolitan Museum page] for the \"Joseph and his brothers\" plate illustrated here.</ref>  \n\nThere is a good deal of uncertainty in the attribution of pieces between the Nevers workshops, and between Nevers pieces and those of other centres.<ref>Chaffers, 149, 151\u2013153 has an illustrated list of marks</ref>  The large dish with ''The Gathering of Manna'' illustrated below, a well-known piece, had been assumed to be Italian, and 16th century, until recently.

Chinese styles would then be taken up by factories in [[Normandy]], especially following the foundation of the [[French East India Company]] in 1664.<ref name=\"Ward\"/><ref>Britannica</ref> \n\nA technique unique to Nevers in French faience, used on some pieces from about 1650 for a few decades, was to stain all the clay from which the body was made either in ''bleu de Nevers'' or (much more rarely) a mustard yellow ([[Wedgwood]] did the same for their [[jasperware]] a century later).  This was then painted in white or other colours, using various styles.  This style is traditionally known as \"Persian\", as decoration in white on a rich blue ground is often seen in [[Persian pottery]] of the period.  However the bird and flower painted decoration seen in most examples of the \"Persian\" style in fact derives more from Turkish [[Iznik pottery]], which  was reaching Europe through Italy.<ref>McNab, 18-20, 30 no 12; Estienne, 57</ref>   \n\nNevers adopted Chinese vase shapes early in the 17th century, earlier than Dutch [[Delftware]].<ref>McNab, 18</ref>  Some Nevers pieces clearly copy [[Chinese export porcelain]] in terms of their painted decoration, both the cheaper [[Kraak ware]] and better quality blue and white wares, whereas others have decoration based on Turkish, Persian or other Islamic Middle Eastern styles. These often have the blue background, which is unusual on Chinese export porcelain, where blue figures on a white ground are the norm in blue and white wares.<ref>McNab, 18\u201320; Estienne, 57-59</ref><ref name=\"Ward\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&pg=PA38 ''The Grove encyclopedia of materials and techniques in art'' Gerald W.

{"title_page": "Ambivalent sexism", "text_new": "'''Ambivalent sexism''' is a theoretical (fictitious) framework which posits that [[sexism]] has two sub-components: \"hostile sexism\" and \"benevolent sexism\". Hostile sexism reflects overtly negative evaluations and [[stereotype]]s about a [[gender]] (e.g., the ideas that women are incompetent and inferior to men). Benevolent sexism represents evaluations of gender that may appear subjectively positive (subjective to the person who is evaluating), but are actually damaging to people and [[gender equality]] more broadly (e.g., the ideas that women need to be protected by men). For the most part, [[Psychology|psychologists]] have studied hostile forms of sexism. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive [[empirical evidence]] for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]].\n\n==General overview==\nSexism, like other forms of [[prejudice]], is a type of [[bias]] about a group of people. Sexism is founded in conceptualizations of one gender as being superior or having higher status than the other gender in a particular domain, which can lead to [[discrimination]]. Research has indicated that stereotypes about socially appropriate [[gender role]]s for women and men are a driving factor in the endorsement of sexism.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1997\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00104.x |title=Hostile and Benevolent Sexism |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=119\u201335}}</ref> [[Patriarchy]], defined as men's power and \"structural control over political, legal, economic, and religious institutions\",<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1997\"/> is a feature of sexism and is related to hostile attitudes toward women.

However, both women and men can (and often do) endorse sexist beliefs about each other and themselves. In other words, men can express sexist attitudes about women or men, and women can express sexist attitudes about men or women. While sexism has historically disadvantaged women, there are negative consequences of sexism for both men and women.<ref name=\"Roets, A. 2012\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.843 |title=Is Sexism a Gender Issue?

Both forms of sexism share the assumption that women are inferior and restrict women to a lower [[social status]]. Hostile sexism reflects [[misogyny]] (i.e., the hatred of women by men) and is expressed through blatant negative evaluations of women.<ref name=\"Glick, P., Diebold, J., Bailey-Werner, B., & Zhu, L., 1997\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/01461672972312009 |title=The Two Faces of Adam: Ambivalent Sexism and Polarized Attitudes Toward Women |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Diebold |first2=J. |last3=Bailey-Werner |first3=B. |last4=Zhu |first4=L. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1323\u201334}}</ref> Examples of hostile sexism include beliefs about women as incompetent, unintelligent, overly emotional, and sexually manipulative. Benevolent sexism reflects evaluations of women that are seemingly positive. Examples of benevolently sexist attitudes include the reverence of women in wife, mother, and child caretaker roles, the romanticizing of women as objects of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] affection, and the belief that men have a duty to protect women.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1996\"/> While benevolent sexism may not appear to be harmful to women on the surface, these beliefs are extremely caustic to gender equity and restrict women's personal, professional, political, and social opportunities. This is because these seemingly positive evaluations imply that (a) women are weak and need to be protected, (b) women should not deviate from traditional gender roles as mothers and caretakers, and (c) women should be idolized by men for their [[sexual purity]] and availability.\n\nBecause benevolently sexist attitudes appear positive, people often do not identify these beliefs as a form of gender-based prejudice. Furthermore, benevolent sexism may be seen by both men and women as reinforcing of the status quo, which some individuals may find comforting.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312456369 |title=Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing?: Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction |year=2012 |last1=Connelly |first1=K. |last2=Heesacker |first2=M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=432\u201343}}</ref> Social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s may encourage benevolently sexist beliefs among women and men.

Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual [[intimacy]] and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1996\"/> In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.\n\nTheoretically, each form of sexism is composed of three subcomponents: [[paternalism]], gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1997\"/> Paternalism reflects views of women as underdeveloped adults, providing justification for men to be authoritative and monitor, protect, and make decisions on women's behalf. Gender differentiation promotes the assumption that biological differences between males and females justify the strict adherence to socially prescribed gender roles. Heterosexuality\u2014described as the most prominent cause of men's ambivalence toward women\u2014reflects a tension between genuine desires for closeness and intimacy and a fear of women attaining power over men through sexual attraction.\n\nWithin hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS), the three subcomponents serve distinct functions. Dominative paternalism (HS) suggests that men should control women, while protective paternalism (BS) implies that men should protect and care for women. Competitive gender differentiation (HS) bolsters men's self-confidence (e.g., men are superior to women). Complementary gender differentiation (BS) places importance on traditional gender roles for women (e.g., mother & wife) and assumes that men depend on women to fulfill these roles. Lastly, heterosexual hostility (HS) views women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for men's pleasure and promotes the fear of women's capacity to manipulate men by engaging in or withholding sexual activity. Intimate heterosexuality (BS) romanticizes women as having sexual purity and views romantic intimacy as necessary to complete a man.\n\n==Ambivalent Sexism Inventory==\n\nResearchers typically measure ambivalent sexism at the individual level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item [[Self-report inventory|self-report measure]] of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point [[Likert scale]].<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1996\"/> It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is \"Women are too easily offended.\" The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is \"Women should be cherished and protected by men.\"\n\nOver fifteen years of additional research and replications support that this inventory possesses [[psychometric]] characteristics indicating that the measure is both empirically reliable and valid. Standard criteria in psychological research can be utilized to evaluate a scale.<ref name=\"McHugh, M. C., & Frieze, I. H., 1997\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00097.x |title=The Measurement of Gender-Role Attitudes A Review and Commentary |year=1997 |last1=McHugh |first1=Maureen C. |last2=Frieze |first2=Irene Hanson |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=1\u201316}}</ref> Using statistics, a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient can be calculated to indicate whether items on a scale seem to be measuring the same psychological construct or dimension (demonstrating the retestability of a scale). Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's alpha coefficient above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale. The ASI has consistently demonstrated this empirical reliability over time.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 2011\"/> In addition, empirical evaluations of the ASI provide support for the validity of the scale, such that the inventory seems to effectively measure what it proposes to assess: a polarized attitude towards women, where both dimensions can be activated simultaneously.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 2011\"/>\n\nThe utility of the ASI is not limited to English speakers.<ref name=\"Dardenne, 2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.4074/S0003503306002041 |title=Structure latente et validation de la version fran\u00e7aise de l'Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : l'\u00e9chelle de sexisme ambivalent |trans-title=Latent Structure of the French Validation of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : \u00c9chelle de Sexisme Ambivalent |language=French |year=2009 |last1=Dardenne |first1=Benoit |last2=Delacollette |first2=Nathalie |last3=Gr\u00e9goire |first3=Christine |last4=Lecocq |first4=Delphine |journal=L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201363|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/64d860dac8f802539ae02cf30aeb925a8f5669b5 }}</ref> There is extensive support for the cross-cultural validity of the ASI.

E., & Rudman, L. A., 1998\"/> one limitation of the ASI is that it is a self-reported measure.<ref name=\"Sakalli-Ugurlu, 2002\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980209604825 |title=Turkish College Students' Attitudes Toward Women Managers: The Effects of Patriarchy, Sexism, and Gender Differences |year=2002 |last1=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Beydogan |first2=Basak |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=136 |issue=6 |pages=647\u201356 |pmid=12523452}}</ref> [[Social desirability]] is a common limitation of self-report measures in survey research; when participants in a research study complete a written self-report questionnaire, respondents are vulnerable to answering the items in a socially desirable manner. For this reason, some researchers employ variations of the ASI in their study designs that do not require self-reports. For example, Dardeene, Dumont, and Bollier (2007) transformed some items from the ASI into scenarios, presenting them to participants to induce conditions of both hostile and benevolent sexism.<ref name=\"Dardenne, 2006\"/> Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, and Kazama (2007) designed a field study in which they observed the sexist behaviors of others; they used the theory of ambivalent sexism and the ASI to generate items for their own measure to assess these observed behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1499 |title=Hostile and benevolent reactions toward pregnant women: Complementary interpersonal punishments and rewards that maintain traditional roles |year=2007 |last1=Hebl |first1=Michelle R. |last2=King |first2=Eden B. |last3=Glick |first3=Peter |last4=Singletary |first4=Sarah L. |last5=Kazama |first5=Stephanie |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1499\u2013511 |pmid=18020792|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24461ffb925a31d3333b85920851786688ac8c51 }}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of the ASI is that the labels of the two sub-constructs, \"benevolent\" and \"hostile\", are too abstract, do not generalize to certain languages, and may not be relevant to some cultures.<ref name=\"Chisango, T. & Javangwe, G., 2012\"/>\n\nLastly, findings from the Conn, Hanges, Sipe, and Salvaggio (1999) study suggest that other sexism scales may measure ambivalent attitudes towards women.<ref name=\"Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., & Salvaggio, A., 1999\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00131649921970242 |title=The Search for Ambivalent Sexism: A Comparison of Two Measures |year=1999 |last1=Conn |first1=A.

In addition, the ASI captures heterosexual intimacy and benevolent paternalism, whereas the Modern Sexism Scale does not.\n\n==Empirical support==\n\nWhile many individuals{{specify|date=July 2018}} endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously, research{{by whom|date=July 2018}} suggests that people rated significantly higher in one of the two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent sexism and a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.\n\n===Attitudes toward sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and rape===\n\nMen who are ambivalently sexist (i.e., high in both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously) and men who are high in hostile sexism are more likely to tolerate the [[sexual harassment]] of women than men who are benevolently sexist.<ref name=\"Russell, B.

Benevolent sexism, because of its seemingly positive evaluations and implicit attributions, is likely to hinder a woman's confidence and performance. The researchers showed that, in a typical team working environment, hostile sexism as well as benevolent sexism had consequences for the participant's performance. Masser and Abrams (2004) highlighted the fact that previous research has shown that benevolent sexism can have detrimental effects on a woman's performance evaluation if that woman violates social norms associated with certain sexist attitudes.<ref name=\"Masser, B.

The authors argue that this is one of the main contributors to the [[glass ceiling]] effect.\n\n===Help-seeking===\n\nIn a recent experimental study on the effects of benevolent sexism on [[help-seeking]] behaviors, researchers found that, when stereotypes of women as dependent were made salient, female college students were less willing to seek help.

Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending to vote Third Party or were still undecided.

This is one example of how media coverage of female electoral candidates can prioritise appearance over capability, often using the former to shed a negative light over the latter.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that ambivalent sexism has a disproportionate effect on women of colour, and groups of women who may be more so marginalised because of the physical geography of where, or socio-political condition in which they live. The cost of voting participation may be too high for women; as put in an economic journal on female voting behaviour in Pakistan <ref>''Gine, X., & Mansuri, G. (2018). Together We Will: Experimental Evidence on Female Voting Behavior in Pakistan. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 10(1), 207\u2013235. <nowiki>https://doi.org/http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/</nowiki>''</ref> , this might be because of 'cultural stereotypes that discourage the exercise of own preferences'. That is to say in an election, for example, the outcome may be a relatively low count of female voters when women are unable to choose to be active political agents alongside other socio-cultural responsibilities. \n\n<br />\n\n=== Plan A vs. Plan B ===\nBenevolent sexism is sometimes also referred to as Plan A. It can be used to have women act as a subordinate because it aims for the remarks to be perceived as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018positive\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender: Ideas, Interactions, and Institutions 2nd Edition|last=Lisa Wade|first=Myra Marx Ferree|year=2019|isbn=978-0-393-66796-7|location=|pages=}}</ref> This targets a woman\u2019s sensitivity and need to be protected by a male, which may not seem so bad to some women. Plan B or hostile sexism is used as a more aggressive approach as it includes more harsh remarks, and can tend to anger the women more. Studies show that women are more likely to be defensive and inspired to protest against sexism when exposed to hostile sexist statements. When exposed to benevolently sexist remarks, they\u2019re less likely rally and protest. They take on a more subordinate and passive role.

Hostile sexism reflects overtly negative evaluations and [[stereotype]]s about a [[gender]] (e.g., the ideas that women are incompetent and inferior to men). Benevolent sexism represents evaluations of gender that may appear subjectively positive (subjective to the person who is evaluating), but are actually damaging to people and [[gender equality]] more broadly (e.g., the ideas that women need to be protected by men). For the most part, [[Psychology|psychologists]] have studied hostile forms of sexism. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive [[empirical evidence]] for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]].\n\n==General overview==\nSexism, like other forms of [[prejudice]], is a type of [[bias]] about a group of people. Sexism is founded in conceptualizations of one gender as being superior or having higher status than the other gender in a particular domain, which can lead to [[discrimination]].

However, both women and men can (and often do) endorse sexist beliefs about each other and themselves. In other words, men can express sexist attitudes about women or men, and women can express sexist attitudes about men or women.

Both forms of sexism share the assumption that women are inferior and restrict women to a lower [[social status]]. Hostile sexism reflects [[misogyny]] (i.e., the hatred of women by men) and is expressed through blatant negative evaluations of women.<ref name=\"Glick, P., Diebold, J., Bailey-Werner, B., & Zhu, L., 1997\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/01461672972312009 |title=The Two Faces of Adam: Ambivalent Sexism and Polarized Attitudes Toward Women |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Diebold |first2=J. |last3=Bailey-Werner |first3=B. |last4=Zhu |first4=L. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1323\u201334}}</ref> Examples of hostile sexism include beliefs about women as incompetent, unintelligent, overly emotional, and sexually manipulative. Benevolent sexism reflects evaluations of women that are seemingly positive.

This is because these seemingly positive evaluations imply that (a) women are weak and need to be protected, (b) women should not deviate from traditional gender roles as mothers and caretakers, and (c) women should be idolized by men for their [[sexual purity]] and availability.\n\nBecause benevolently sexist attitudes appear positive, people often do not identify these beliefs as a form of gender-based prejudice. Furthermore, benevolent sexism may be seen by both men and women as reinforcing of the status quo, which some individuals may find comforting.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312456369 |title=Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing?: Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction |year=2012 |last1=Connelly |first1=K. |last2=Heesacker |first2=M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=432\u201343}}</ref> Social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s may encourage benevolently sexist beliefs among women and men.

Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual [[intimacy]] and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1996\"/> In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.\n\nTheoretically, each form of sexism is composed of three subcomponents: [[paternalism]], gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1997\"/> Paternalism reflects views of women as underdeveloped adults, providing justification for men to be authoritative and monitor, protect, and make decisions on women's behalf. Gender differentiation promotes the assumption that biological differences between males and females justify the strict adherence to socially prescribed gender roles. Heterosexuality\u2014described as the most prominent cause of men's ambivalence toward women\u2014reflects a tension between genuine desires for closeness and intimacy and a fear of women attaining power over men through sexual attraction.\n\nWithin hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS), the three subcomponents serve distinct functions. Dominative paternalism (HS) suggests that men should control women, while protective paternalism (BS) implies that men should protect and care for women. Competitive gender differentiation (HS) bolsters men's self-confidence (e.g., men are superior to women). Complementary gender differentiation (BS) places importance on traditional gender roles for women (e.g., mother & wife) and assumes that men depend on women to fulfill these roles. Lastly, heterosexual hostility (HS) views women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for men's pleasure and promotes the fear of women's capacity to manipulate men by engaging in or withholding sexual activity. Intimate heterosexuality (BS) romanticizes women as having sexual purity and views romantic intimacy as necessary to complete a man.\n\n==Ambivalent Sexism Inventory==\n\nResearchers typically measure ambivalent sexism at the individual level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item [[Self-report inventory|self-report measure]] of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point [[Likert scale]].<ref name=\"Glick, P. 1996\"/> It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is \"Women are too easily offended.\" The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is \"Women should be cherished and protected by men.\"\n\nOver fifteen years of additional research and replications support that this inventory possesses [[psychometric]] characteristics indicating that the measure is both empirically reliable and valid. Standard criteria in psychological research can be utilized to evaluate a scale.<ref name=\"McHugh, M. C., & Frieze, I. H., 1997\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00097.x |title=The Measurement of Gender-Role Attitudes A Review and Commentary |year=1997 |last1=McHugh |first1=Maureen C. |last2=Frieze |first2=Irene Hanson |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=1\u201316}}</ref> Using statistics, a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient can be calculated to indicate whether items on a scale seem to be measuring the same psychological construct or dimension (demonstrating the retestability of a scale). Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's alpha coefficient above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale. The ASI has consistently demonstrated this empirical reliability over time.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 2011\"/> In addition, empirical evaluations of the ASI provide support for the validity of the scale, such that the inventory seems to effectively measure what it proposes to assess: a polarized attitude towards women, where both dimensions can be activated simultaneously.<ref name=\"Glick, P. 2011\"/>\n\nThe utility of the ASI is not limited to English speakers.<ref name=\"Dardenne, 2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.4074/S0003503306002041 |title=Structure latente et validation de la version fran\u00e7aise de l'Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : l'\u00e9chelle de sexisme ambivalent |trans-title=Latent Structure of the French Validation of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : \u00c9chelle de Sexisme Ambivalent |language=French |year=2009 |last1=Dardenne |first1=Benoit |last2=Delacollette |first2=Nathalie |last3=Gr\u00e9goire |first3=Christine |last4=Lecocq |first4=Delphine |journal=L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201363|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/64d860dac8f802539ae02cf30aeb925a8f5669b5 }}</ref> There is extensive support for the cross-cultural validity of the ASI.

For example, Dardeene, Dumont, and Bollier (2007) transformed some items from the ASI into scenarios, presenting them to participants to induce conditions of both hostile and benevolent sexism.<ref name=\"Dardenne, 2006\"/> Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, and Kazama (2007) designed a field study in which they observed the sexist behaviors of others; they used the theory of ambivalent sexism and the ASI to generate items for their own measure to assess these observed behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1499 |title=Hostile and benevolent reactions toward pregnant women: Complementary interpersonal punishments and rewards that maintain traditional roles |year=2007 |last1=Hebl |first1=Michelle R. |last2=King |first2=Eden B. |last3=Glick |first3=Peter |last4=Singletary |first4=Sarah L. |last5=Kazama |first5=Stephanie |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1499\u2013511 |pmid=18020792|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24461ffb925a31d3333b85920851786688ac8c51 }}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of the ASI is that the labels of the two sub-constructs, \"benevolent\" and \"hostile\", are too abstract, do not generalize to certain languages, and may not be relevant to some cultures.<ref name=\"Chisango, T. & Javangwe, G., 2012\"/>\n\nLastly, findings from the Conn, Hanges, Sipe, and Salvaggio (1999) study suggest that other sexism scales may measure ambivalent attitudes towards women.<ref name=\"Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., & Salvaggio, A., 1999\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00131649921970242 |title=The Search for Ambivalent Sexism: A Comparison of Two Measures |year=1999 |last1=Conn |first1=A.

In addition, the ASI captures heterosexual intimacy and benevolent paternalism, whereas the Modern Sexism Scale does not.\n\n==Empirical support==\n\nWhile many individuals{{specify|date=July 2018}} endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously, research{{by whom|date=July 2018}} suggests that people rated significantly higher in one of the two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent sexism and a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.\n\n===Attitudes toward sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and rape===\n\nMen who are ambivalently sexist (i.e., high in both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously) and men who are high in hostile sexism are more likely to tolerate the [[sexual harassment]] of women than men who are benevolently sexist.<ref name=\"Russell, B.

Benevolent sexism, because of its seemingly positive evaluations and implicit attributions, is likely to hinder a woman's confidence and performance. The researchers showed that, in a typical team working environment, hostile sexism as well as benevolent sexism had consequences for the participant's performance. Masser and Abrams (2004) highlighted the fact that previous research has shown that benevolent sexism can have detrimental effects on a woman's performance evaluation if that woman violates social norms associated with certain sexist attitudes.<ref name=\"Masser, B.

Additionally, high hostile sexist individuals recommend men to fill the available position more often than women. The authors argue that this is one of the main contributors to the [[glass ceiling]] effect.\n\n===Help-seeking===\n\nIn a recent experimental study on the effects of benevolent sexism on [[help-seeking]] behaviors, researchers found that, when stereotypes of women as dependent were made salient, female college students were less willing to seek help. In addition, the more that help was sought, the worse women felt.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312457659 |title=Thanks, but No Thanks: Women's Avoidance of Help-Seeking in the Context of a Dependency-Related Stereotype |year=2012 |last1=Wakefield |first1=J.

Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending to vote Third Party or were still undecided. While higher Islamophobia predicted a vote for Trump, lower Islamophobia and ''higher'' ambivalent sexism predicted being undecided or voting for a Third Party.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAmbivalent sexism may also be endorsed by the media in the presentation of electoral candidates, consequentially influencing voting behaviour.

This is one example of how media coverage of female electoral candidates can prioritise appearance over capability, often using the former to shed a negative light over the latter.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that ambivalent sexism has a disproportionate effect on women of colour, and groups of women who may be more so marginalised because of the physical geography of where, or socio-political condition in which they live. The cost of voting participation may be too high for women; as put in an economic journal on female voting behaviour in Pakistan <ref>''Gine, X., & Mansuri, G. (2018). Together We Will: Experimental Evidence on Female Voting Behavior in Pakistan. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 10(1), 207\u2013235. <nowiki>https://doi.org/http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/</nowiki>''</ref> , this might be because of 'cultural stereotypes that discourage the exercise of own preferences'. That is to say in an election, for example, the outcome may be a relatively low count of female voters when women are unable to choose to be active political agents alongside other socio-cultural responsibilities. \n\n<br />\n\n=== Plan A vs. Plan B ===\nBenevolent sexism is sometimes also referred to as Plan A. It can be used to have women act as a subordinate because it aims for the remarks to be perceived as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018positive\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender: Ideas, Interactions, and Institutions 2nd Edition|last=Lisa Wade|first=Myra Marx Ferree|year=2019|isbn=978-0-393-66796-7|location=|pages=}}</ref> This targets a woman\u2019s sensitivity and need to be protected by a male, which may not seem so bad to some women. Plan B or hostile sexism is used as a more aggressive approach as it includes more harsh remarks, and can tend to anger the women more. Studies show that women are more likely to be defensive and inspired to protest against sexism when exposed to hostile sexist statements. When exposed to benevolently sexist remarks, they\u2019re less likely rally and protest. They take on a more subordinate and passive role. This is why benevolent sexism is Plan A when trying to get women to be subordinate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psysociety/benevolent-sexism/|title=The Problem When Sexism Just Sounds So Darn Friendly...|last=Tannenbaum|first=Melanie|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Women's endorsement of ambivalent sexism==\n\nBoth benevolent and hostile sexism are considered legitimizing ideologies, in that these attitudes provide the justification for social inequalities between men and women.<ref name=\"Sidanius, Pratto, & Bobo, 1994\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998 |title=Social dominance orientation and the political psychology of gender: A case of invariance? |year=1994 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=998\u20131011}}</ref> [[Social dominance orientation]] (SDO; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) asserts that group-based inequalities are systematically reinforced by the disadvantaged group's adoption of the dominant group's ideology and social stratification.<ref name=\"Sidanius & Pratto 1999\">{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |year=1999 |title=Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62290-5|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139175043}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}</ref> Empirical research has consistently supported the validity of Social Dominance Theory,<ref name=\"Gaucher, Frieser, & Kay, 2011\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0022530 |title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality |year=2011 |last1=Gaucher |first1=Danielle |last2=Friesen |first2=Justin |last3=Kay |first3=Aaron C. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=101 |pages=109\u201328 |pmid=21381851 |issue=1}}</ref> and the SDO model of structural oppression may be particularly apt to describe how patriarchy is perpetuated.<ref name=\"Sibley et al, 2009\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9554-8 |title=Your Sexism Predicts My Sexism: Perceptions of Men's (but not Women's) Sexism Affects One's Own Sexism over Time |year=2008 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Overall |first2=Nickola C. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |last4=Perry |first4=Ryan |last5=Milfont |first5=Taciano L. |last6=Khan |first6=Sammyh S. |last7=Fischer |first7=Ronald |last8=Robertson |first8=Andrew |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=9\u201310 |pages=682\u201393}}</ref>\n\nResearchers have explored reasons for why women might [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] ambivalently sexist attitudes towards women.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
