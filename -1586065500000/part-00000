The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word ''plandovati'' used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means ''odmarati'', and in English means ''to rest''.\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century, the Hungarian empire started its reign, and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In the 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two-thirds of Hungary, including Banat.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th-century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550.<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref> They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* ''Pervan'' is Serbian and means ''first'', which is common at that time and area to distinguish different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker does not tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it is nothing more than a guess: in German it is common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Hungarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happened to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nThe fact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b existed at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref> In 1738 the Ottoman Turks struck back, destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of the Habsburg dynasty. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[President (government title)|president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>\n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Later, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also, the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got its present name Plandi\u0161te. The German population was expelled under harsh conditions. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nThe fact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b existed at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks struck back, destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of the Habsburg dynasty. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[President (government title)|president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>.\n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Later, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also, the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got its present name Plandi\u0161te. The German population was expelled under harsh conditions. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

It was hugely popular in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe series was originally scheduled for just 15 episodes. However, the show garnered high ratings when the initial episodes aired. Due to its popularity, CTS expanded the show to 236 episodes.\n\nThe [[TVB]] and [[ATV Home]] networks in Hong Kong both bought the series in an attempt to gain viewers. Competition between the two networks during the showing of the series was so severe that identical episodes were shown on both channels on the same night. It was also one of the first dramas that used [[NICAM]] technology ([[Second audio program|Dual Sound Switch]] Cantonese/Mandarin).\n\n==List of cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The opening theme, performed by Hu Kua, has the same title as the series. It was originally performed by Chiang Kuang-Chao for the earlier 1974 CTS series also of the same name.\n* A [[Cantonese]] [[cover version|cover]] (\"\u9858\u4e16\u9593\u6709\u9752\u5929\") performed by [[George Lam]] with lyrics by [[Wong Jim]] was the opening theme of the series on [[TVB]] in Hong Kong.

A popular English version from the Singaporean band Tokyo Square was titled \"Can't Let Go\". Huang An's own English version was titled \"When It Comes to Love\".

It was hugely popular in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe series was originally scheduled for just 15 episodes. However, the show garnered high ratings when the initial episodes aired. Due to its popularity, CTS expanded the show to 236 episodes.\n\nThe [[TVB]] and [[ATV Home]] networks in Hong Kong both bought the series in an attempt to gain viewers. Competition between the two networks during the showing of the series was so severe that identical episodes were shown on both channels on the same night. It was also one of the first dramas that used [[NICAM]] technology ([[Second audio program|Dual Sound Switch]] Cantonese/Mandarin).\n\n==List of cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

In a preface for the 1950 edition, White recalled, \"Thurber and I were neither more, nor less, interested in the subject of love and marriage than anybody else of our age in that era. I recall that we were both profoundly interested in earning a living, and I think we somehow managed, simultaneously, to arrive at the conclusion that. . . the heavy writers had got sex down and were breaking its arm. We were determined that sex should maintain its high spirits.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Is Sex Necessary?|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/9/7/is-sex-necessary |website=The Attic|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhite and Thurber wrote alternate chapters, then compared them for overlap. They invented numerous pseudo-sexual terms, including Diversion Subterfuge, Osculatory Justification, and Schmalhausen Trouble. They also fabricated the names of psychologists and sex researchers, including Dr. Karl Zaner and Dr. Walter Titheridge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JUJLvNCAJzwC&pg=PA347&lpg=PA347&dq=dr.+karl+zaner#v=onepage&q=dr.%20karl%20zaner&f=false|title=The Thurber Letters: The Wit, Wisdom and Surprising Life of James Thurber|last=Kinney|first=Harrison|last2=Thurber|first2=Rosemary A.|date=2007-11-01|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743226219|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhite and Thurber held little hope of publication but Harper's, which had published White's first book of poetry, came out with a small printing of 2,500 copies in November 1929. The book became a bestseller and launched the publishing careers of both Thurber and White. A critic for the [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]] called the book, \"One of the silliest books in years, and perfectly lovely. It left this reviewer weak partially paralyzed, with a written face streaming with tears.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The book also introduced readers to Thurber's spare cartoons, which soon became a regular feature in [[The New Yorker]].  \n\nThe 75th anniversary edition published in 2004 includes a foreword by [[John Updike]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Is Sex Necessary? or, Why You Feel the Way You Do|last=Thurber|first=James|last2=White|first2=E.

With his erudition, he impressed the Governor-General, and also the director of the botanical garden at Buitenzorg (now [[Bogor]]), [[Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> These men sensed in Siebold a worthy successor to [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] and [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], two former resident physicians at [[Dejima]], a Dutch trading post in [[Japan]], the latter of whom was the author of ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}''.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The [[Batavian Academy of Arts and Sciences]] soon elected Siebold as a member.\n\n===Arrival in Japan===\nOn 28 June 1823, after only a few months in the Dutch East Indies, Siebold was posted as resident [[physician]] and [[scientist]] to [[Dejima]], a small artificial island and trading post at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and arrived there on 11 August 1823.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> During an eventful voyage to Japan he only just escaped drowning during a [[typhoon]] in the [[East China Sea]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> As only a very small number of Dutch personnel were allowed to live on this island, the posts of physician and scientist had to be combined. Dejima had been in the possession of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (known as the VOC) since the 17th century, but the Company had gone bankrupt in 1798, after which a trading post was operated there by the Dutch state for political considerations, with notable benefits to the Japanese.\n\nThe European tradition of sending doctors with botanical training to Japan was a long one. Sent on a mission by the Dutch East India Company, [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] (1651\u20131716), a German physician and botanist who lived in Japan from 1690 until 1692, ushered in this tradition of a combination of physician and botanist. The Dutch East India Company did not, however, actually employ the Swedish botanist and physician [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] (1743\u20131828), who had arrived in Japan in 1775.\n\n===Medical practice===\nJapanese scientists invited Siebold to show them the marvels of western science, and he learned in return through them much about the Japanese and their customs. After curing an influential local officer, Siebold gained the permission to leave the trade post. He used this opportunity to treat Japanese patients in the greater area around the trade post. Siebold is credited with the introduction of [[vaccination]] and pathological anatomy for the first time in Japan.<ref name=\"Odagiri-Goto\">{{cite book |author=Hiroyuki Odagiri & Akira Got\u014d | title = Technology and Industrial Development in Japan | publisher =[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-19-828802-6 | page = 236}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824, Siebold started a medical school in Nagasaki, the ''Narutaki-juku'',<ref>http://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec02.htm</ref> that grew into a meeting place for around fifty ''students''. They helped him in his botanical and naturalistic studies. The Dutch language became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' (common spoken language) for these academic and scholarly contacts for a generation, until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nHis patients paid him in kind with a variety of objects and artifacts that would later gain historical significance. These everyday objects later became the basis of his large [[ethnography|ethnographic]] collection, which consisted of everyday household goods, [[woodblock prints]], tools and hand-crafted objects used by the Japanese people.\n\n===Japanese family===\nDuring his stay in Japan, Siebold \"lived together\" with Kusumoto Taki (\u6960\u672c\u6edd),<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> who gave birth to their daughter [[Kusumoto Ine|Kusumoto (O-)Ine]] in 1827.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Siebold used to call his wife \"Otakusa\" (probably derived from O-Taki-san) and named a ''[[Hydrangea]]'' after her. Kusumoto Ine eventually became the first Japanese woman known to have received a physician's training and became a highly regarded practicing physician and court physician to the Empress in 1882. She died at court in 1903.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/><ref>[http://www.unterstein.net/Toyoashihara-no-Chiaki-Nagaioaki-no-Mitsuho-no-Kuni/SieboldGED/g0000001-x.html#I65880 Unterstein.net: Siebold family]</ref>\n\n===Studies of Japanese fauna and flora===\nHis main interest, however, focused on the study of Japanese fauna and flora. He collected as much material as he could. Starting a small botanical garden behind his home (there was not much room on the small island) Siebold amassed over 1,000 native plants.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> In a specially built [[greenhouse|glasshouse]] he cultivated the Japanese plants to endure the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[climate]]. Local Japanese artists like [[Kawahara Keiga]] drew and painted images of these plants, creating botanical illustrations but also images of the daily life in Japan, which complemented his ethnographic collection. He hired Japanese hunters to track rare animals and collect specimens. Many specimens were collected with the help of his Japanese collaborators [[Keisuke Ito]] (1803\u20131901), Mizutani Sugeroku (1779\u20131833), \u014ckochi Zonshin (1796\u20131882) and Katsuragawa Hoken (1797\u20131844), a physician to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. As well, Siebold's assistant and later successor, [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]] (1806\u20131858), proved to be indispensable in carrying on Siebold's work in Japan.\n\nSiebold first introduced to Europe such familiar garden-plants as the ''[[Hosta]]'' and the [[Hydrangea|''Hydrangea otaksa'']]. Unknown to the Japanese, he was also able to smuggle out germinative seeds of [[Camellia sinensis|tea plants]] to the botanical garden ''{{Lang|nl|Buitenzorg}}'' in Batavia. Through this single act, he started the [[tea culture]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], a Dutch [[colony]] at the time. Until then Japan had strictly guarded the trade in tea plants. Remarkably, in 1833, Java already could boast a half million tea plants.\n\nHe also introduced Japanese knotweed (''[[Reynoutria japonica]]'', [[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Fallopia japonica''), which has become a highly invasive weed in Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://archive.bsbi.org.uk/Wats23p93.pdf|first1=J.P.|last1=Bailey|first2=A.P.|last2=Conolly|date=2000|journal=Watsonia|volume=23|pages=93\u2013110|title=\"Prize-winners to pariahs - A history of Japanese Knotweed ''s.l.''

The shipment to Leiden contained the first specimens of the [[Japanese giant salamander]] (''Andrias japonicus'') to be sent to Europe.\n\nIn 1825 the government of the Dutch-Indies provided him with two assistants: apothecary and mineralogist [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]] (his later successor) and the painter [[Carl Hubert de Villeneuve]]. Each would prove to be useful to Siebold's efforts that ranged from ethnographical to botanical to horticultural, when attempting to document the exotic Eastern Japanese experience. De Villeneuve taught Kawahara the techniques of Western painting.\n\nReportedly, Siebold was not the easiest man to deal with. He was in continuous conflict with his Dutch superiors who felt he was arrogant. This threat of conflict resulted in his recall in July 1827 back to Batavia. But the ship, the ''Cornelis Houtman'', sent to carry him back to Batavia, was thrown ashore by a typhoon in Nagasaki bay. The same storm badly damaged Dejima and destroyed Siebold's botanical garden. Repaired, the ''Cornelis Houtman'' was refloated. It left for Batavia with 89 crates of Siebold's salvaged botanical collection, but Siebold himself remained behind in Dejima.\n\n===Siebold Incident===\nIn 1826 Siebold made the court journey to [[Edo]]. During this long trip he collected many plants and animals. But he also obtained from the court astronomer Takahashi Kageyasu several detailed maps of Japan and Korea (written by [[In\u014d Tadataka]]), an act strictly forbidden by the Japanese government.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> When the Japanese discovered, by accident, that Siebold had a map of the northern parts of Japan, the government accused him of [[high treason]] and of being a spy for [[Russia]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\nThe Japanese placed Siebold under house arrest and expelled him from [[Japan]] on 22 October 1829.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Satisfied that his Japanese collaborators would continue his work, he journeyed back on the frigate ''Java'' to his former residence, Batavia, in possession of his enormous collection of thousands of animals and plants, his books and his maps.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The botanical garden of ''{{lang|nl|Buitenzorg}}'' would soon house Siebold's surviving, living flora collection of 2,000 plants. He arrived in the Netherlands on 7 July 1830. His stay in Japan and Batavia had lasted for a period of eight years.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\n===Return to Europe===\nPhilipp Franz von Siebold arrived in the Netherlands in 1830, just at a time when  political troubles erupted in [[Brussels]], leading soon to [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence]]. Hastily he salvaged his ethnographic collections in [[Antwerp]] and his herbarium specimens in Brussels and took them to [[Leiden]], helped by [[Johann Baptist Fischer]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He left behind his botanical collections of living plants that were sent to the [[University of Ghent]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The consequent expansion of this collection of rare and exotic plants led to the horticultural fame of [[Ghent]]. In gratitude the University of Ghent presented him in 1841 with specimens of every plant from his original collection.\n\nSiebold settled in Leiden, taking with him the major part of his collection.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The \"Philipp Franz von Siebold collection\", containing many [[type specimen]]s, was the earliest botanical collection from Japan. Even today, it still remains a subject of ongoing research, a testimony to the depth of work undertaken by Siebold. It contained about 12,000 specimens, from which he could describe only about 2,300 species. The whole collection was purchased for a handsome amount by the Dutch government. Siebold was also granted a substantial annual allowance by the Dutch King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] and was appointed ''Advisor to the King for Japanese Affairs''. In 1842, the King even raised Siebold to the nobility as an esquire.\n\nThe \"Siebold collection\" opened to the public in 1831. He founded a museum in his home in 1837. This small, private museum would eventually evolve into the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]] in Leiden.<ref>{{cite book |author=Willem Otterspeer |year=1989 |title=Leiden Oriental Connections, 1850\u20131940 |volume=5 |series=Studies in the History of Leiden University |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|E.

This flora collection formed the basis of the Japanese collections of the [[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]]<ref>[http://www.nationaalherbarium.nl/ Nationaal Herbarium Nederland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in Leiden, while the zoological specimens Siebold collected were kept by the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]] (''National Museum of Natural History'') in Leiden, which later became Naturalis. Both institutions merged into [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]] in 2010, which now maintains the entire natural history collection that Siebold brought back to Leiden.<ref>[http://www.naturalis.nl/en/ Naturalis Biodiversity Center homepage (in English)]</ref>\n\nIn 1845 Siebold married Helene von Gagern (1820\u20131877), they had three sons and two daughters.\n\n===Writings===\nDuring his stay in Leiden, Siebold wrote ''Nippon'' in 1832, the first part of a volume of a richly illustrated ethnographical and geographical work on Japan. The 'Archiv zur Beschreibung Nippons' also contained a report of his journey to the Shogunate Court at Edo.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He wrote six further parts, the last ones published posthumously in 1882; his sons published an edited and lower-priced reprint in 1887.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\n[[File:Cephalotaxus pedunculata SZ132.png|thumb|left|upright|Coloured plate of ''[[Cephalotaxus pedunculata]]'' in ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}'', by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]]\n\nThe ''{{lang|la|Bibliotheca Japonica}}'' appeared between 1833 and 1841. This work was co-authored by Joseph Hoffmann and Kuo Cheng-Chang, a Javanese of Chinese extraction, who had journeyed along with Siebold from Batavia.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> It contained a survey of Japanese literature and a Chinese, Japanese and Korean dictionary.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Siebold's writing on Japanese religion and customs notably shaped early modern European conceptions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]; he notably suggested that Japanese Buddhism was a form of [[Monotheism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=12\u20134|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}</ref>\n\nThe zoologists [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck|Coenraad Temminck]] (1777\u20131858), [[Hermann Schlegel]] (1804\u20131884), and [[Wilhem de Haan]] (1801\u20131855) scientifically described and documented Siebold's collection of Japanese animals.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The ''{{lang|la|[[Fauna Japonica]]}}'', a series of monographs published between 1833 and 1850, was mainly based on Siebold's collection, making the Japanese fauna the best-described non-European fauna \u2013 \"a remarkable feat\". A significant part of the ''{{lang|la|Fauna Japonica}}'' was also based on the collections of Siebold's successor on Dejima, [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]].\n\nSiebold wrote his ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}'' in collaboration with the German botanist [[Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]] (1797\u20131848). It first appeared in 1835, but the work was not completed until after his death, finished in 1870 by F.A.W. Miquel (1811\u20131871), director of the Rijksherbarium in Leiden. This work expanded Siebold's scientific fame from Japan to Europe.\n\nFrom the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]] \u2013 the botanical garden of Leiden \u2013 many of Siebold's plants spread to Europe and from there to other countries. ''Hosta'' and ''[[Hortensia]]'', ''[[Azalea]]'', and the Japanese [[butterbur]] and the [[Petasites|coltsfoot]] as well as the [[Japanese larch]] began to inhabit gardens across the world.\n\n===International endeavours===\n[[File:Coat of arms of von Siebold.png|200px|thumb|Coat of arms of Siebold]]\nAfter his return to Europe, Siebold tried to exploit his knowledge of Japan. Whilst living in [[Boppard]], from 1852 he corresponded with Russian diplomats such as [[Andreas Feodorowitsch Budberg|Baron von Budberg-B\u00f6nninghausen]], the Russian ambassador to [[Prussia]], which resulted in an invitation to go to St Petersburg to advise the Russian government how to open trade relations with Japan. Though still employed by the Dutch government he did not inform the Dutch of this voyage until after his return.\n\nAmerican Naval Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] consulted Siebold in advance of his voyage to Japan in 1854.<ref>{{cite book |author=John S.

He returned to Japan in 1859 as an adviser to the Agent of the Dutch Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) in Nagasaki, Albert Bauduin. After two years the connection with the Trading Society was severed as the advice of Siebold was considered to be of no value. In Nagasaki he fathered another child with one of his female servants.\n\nIn 1861 Siebold organised his appointment as an adviser to the Japanese government and went in that function to Edo. There he tried to obtain a position between the foreign representatives and the Japanese government. As he had been specially admonished by the Dutch authorities before going to Japan that he was to abstain from all interference in politics, the Dutch Consul General in Japan, J.K. de Wit, was ordered to ask Siebold's removal.<ref>{{cite book |author=Herman J.

After he did not succeed in gaining employment with the Russian government, he went to Paris in 1865 to try to interest the French government in funding another expedition to Japan, but failed.<ref>The story is told by [[Alphonse Daudet]] in the short story \"L'Empereur aveugle\", part of his book \"Contes du lundi\".</ref> He died in [[Munich]] on 18 October 1866.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Plants named after Siebold===\nThe botanical and horticultural spheres of influence have honored Philipp Franz von Siebold by naming some of the very garden-worthy plants that he studied after him.

One of his professors was [[Franz Xaver Heller]] (1775\u20131840), author of the ''{{Lang|la|Flora Wirceburgensis}}'' (\"Flora of the Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg\", 1810\u20131811).<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> [[Ignaz D\u00f6llinger]] (1770\u20131841), his professor of anatomy and physiology, however, most influenced him. D\u00f6llinger was one of the first professors to understand and treat medicine as a natural science. Siebold stayed with D\u00f6llinger, where he came in regular contact with other scientists.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He read the books of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], a famous naturalist and explorer, which probably raised his desire to travel to distant lands.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Philipp Franz von Siebold became a physician by earning his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1820. He initially practiced medicine in [[Heidingsfeld]], in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], now part of [[W\u00fcrzburg]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\nInvited to Holland by an acquaintance of his family, Siebold applied for a position as a military physician, which would enable him to travel to the Dutch colonies.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He entered the Dutch military service on June 19, 1822, and was appointed as ship's surgeon on the frigate ''Adriana'', sailing from [[Rotterdam]] to Batavia (present-day [[Jakarta]]) in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now called [[Indonesia]]).<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> On his trip to Batavia on the frigate ''Adriana'', Siebold practiced his knowledge of the Dutch language and also rapidly learned [[Malay language|Malay]], and during the long voyage he began a collection of marine fauna.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He arrived in Batavia on February 18, 1823.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\nAs an army medical officer, Siebold was posted to an [[artillery]] unit. However, he was given a room for a few weeks at the residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Baron [[Godert van der Capellen]], to recover from an illness. With his erudition, he impressed the Governor-General, and also the director of the botanical garden at Buitenzorg (now [[Bogor]]), [[Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> These men sensed in Siebold a worthy successor to [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] and [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], two former resident physicians at [[Dejima]], a Dutch trading post in [[Japan]], the latter of whom was the author of ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}''.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The [[Batavian Academy of Arts and Sciences]] soon elected Siebold as a member.\n\n===Arrival in Japan===\nOn 28 June 1823, after only a few months in the Dutch East Indies, Siebold was posted as resident [[physician]] and [[scientist]] to [[Dejima]], a small artificial island and trading post at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and arrived there on 11 August 1823.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> During an eventful voyage to Japan he only just escaped drowning during a [[typhoon]] in the [[East China Sea]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> As only a very small number of Dutch personnel were allowed to live on this island, the posts of physician and scientist had to be combined. Dejima had been in the possession of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (known as the VOC) since the 17th century, but the Company had gone bankrupt in 1798, after which a trading post was operated there by the Dutch state for political considerations, with notable benefits to the Japanese.\n\nThe European tradition of sending doctors with botanical training to Japan was a long one. Sent on a mission by the Dutch East India Company, [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] (1651\u20131716), a German physician and botanist who lived in Japan from 1690 until 1692, ushered in this tradition of a combination of physician and botanist. The Dutch East India Company did not, however, actually employ the Swedish botanist and physician [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] (1743\u20131828), who had arrived in Japan in 1775.\n\n===Medical practice===\nJapanese scientists invited Siebold to show them the marvels of western science, and he learned in return through them much about the Japanese and their customs. After curing an influential local officer, Siebold gained the permission to leave the trade post. He used this opportunity to treat Japanese patients in the greater area around the trade post. Siebold is credited with the introduction of [[vaccination]] and pathological anatomy for the first time in Japan.<ref name=\"Odagiri-Goto\">{{cite book |author=Hiroyuki Odagiri & Akira Got\u014d | title = Technology and Industrial Development in Japan | publisher =[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-19-828802-6 | page = 236}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824, Siebold started a medical school in Nagasaki, the ''Narutaki-juku'',<ref>http://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec02.htm</ref> that grew into a meeting place for around fifty ''students''. They helped him in his botanical and naturalistic studies. The Dutch language became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' (common spoken language) for these academic and scholarly contacts for a generation, until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nHis patients paid him in kind with a variety of objects and artifacts that would later gain historical significance. These everyday objects later became the basis of his large [[ethnography|ethnographic]] collection, which consisted of everyday household goods, [[woodblock prints]], tools and hand-crafted objects used by the Japanese people.\n\n===Japanese family===\nDuring his stay in Japan, Siebold \"lived together\" with Kusumoto Taki (\u6960\u672c\u6edd),<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> who gave birth to their daughter [[Kusumoto Ine|Kusumoto (O-)Ine]] in 1827.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Siebold used to call his wife \"Otakusa\" (probably derived from O-Taki-san) and named a ''[[Hydrangea]]'' after her. Kusumoto Ine eventually became the first Japanese woman known to have received a physician's training and became a highly regarded practicing physician and court physician to the Empress in 1882. She died at court in 1903.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/><ref>[http://www.unterstein.net/Toyoashihara-no-Chiaki-Nagaioaki-no-Mitsuho-no-Kuni/SieboldGED/g0000001-x.html#I65880 Unterstein.net: Siebold family]</ref>\n\n===Studies of Japanese fauna and flora===\nHis main interest, however, focused on the study of Japanese fauna and flora. He collected as much material as he could. Starting a small botanical garden behind his home (there was not much room on the small island) Siebold amassed over 1,000 native plants.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> In a specially built [[greenhouse|glasshouse]] he cultivated the Japanese plants to endure the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[climate]]. Local Japanese artists like [[Kawahara Keiga]] drew and painted images of these plants, creating botanical illustrations but also images of the daily life in Japan, which complemented his ethnographic collection. He hired Japanese hunters to track rare animals and collect specimens. Many specimens were collected with the help of his Japanese collaborators [[Keisuke Ito]] (1803\u20131901), Mizutani Sugeroku (1779\u20131833), \u014ckochi Zonshin (1796\u20131882) and Katsuragawa Hoken (1797\u20131844), a physician to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. As well, Siebold's assistant and later successor, [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]] (1806\u20131858), proved to be indispensable in carrying on Siebold's work in Japan.\n\nSiebold first introduced to Europe such familiar garden-plants as the ''[[Hosta]]'' and the [[Hydrangea|''Hydrangea otaksa'']]. Unknown to the Japanese, he was also able to smuggle out germinative seeds of [[Camellia sinensis|tea plants]] to the botanical garden ''{{Lang|nl|Buitenzorg}}'' in Batavia. Through this single act, he started the [[tea culture]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], a Dutch [[colony]] at the time. Until then Japan had strictly guarded the trade in tea plants. Remarkably, in 1833, Java already could boast a half million tea plants.\n\nHe also introduced Japanese knotweed (''[[Reynoutria japonica]]'', [[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Fallopia japonica''), which has become a highly invasive weed in Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://archive.bsbi.org.uk/Wats23p93.pdf|first1=J.P.|last1=Bailey|first2=A.P.|last2=Conolly|date=2000|journal=Watsonia|volume=23|pages=93\u2013110|title=\"Prize-winners to pariahs - A history of Japanese Knotweed ''s.l.'' (Polygonaceae) in the British Isles\"|access-date=October 26, 2018}}</ref> All derive from a single female plant collected by Siebold.\n\nDuring his stay at Dejima, Siebold sent three shipments with an unknown number of herbarium specimens to [[Leiden]], [[Ghent]], [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]]. The shipment to Leiden contained the first specimens of the [[Japanese giant salamander]] (''Andrias japonicus'') to be sent to Europe.\n\nIn 1825 the government of the Dutch-Indies provided him with two assistants: apothecary and mineralogist [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]] (his later successor) and the painter [[Carl Hubert de Villeneuve]]. Each would prove to be useful to Siebold's efforts that ranged from ethnographical to botanical to horticultural, when attempting to document the exotic Eastern Japanese experience. De Villeneuve taught Kawahara the techniques of Western painting.\n\nReportedly, Siebold was not the easiest man to deal with. He was in continuous conflict with his Dutch superiors who felt he was arrogant. This threat of conflict resulted in his recall in July 1827 back to Batavia. But the ship, the ''Cornelis Houtman'', sent to carry him back to Batavia, was thrown ashore by a typhoon in Nagasaki bay. The same storm badly damaged Dejima and destroyed Siebold's botanical garden. Repaired, the ''Cornelis Houtman'' was refloated. It left for Batavia with 89 crates of Siebold's salvaged botanical collection, but Siebold himself remained behind in Dejima.\n\n===Siebold Incident===\nIn 1826 Siebold made the court journey to [[Edo]]. During this long trip he collected many plants and animals. But he also obtained from the court astronomer Takahashi Kageyasu several detailed maps of Japan and Korea (written by [[In\u014d Tadataka]]), an act strictly forbidden by the Japanese government.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> When the Japanese discovered, by accident, that Siebold had a map of the northern parts of Japan, the government accused him of [[high treason]] and of being a spy for [[Russia]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\nThe Japanese placed Siebold under house arrest and expelled him from [[Japan]] on 22 October 1829.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Satisfied that his Japanese collaborators would continue his work, he journeyed back on the frigate ''Java'' to his former residence, Batavia, in possession of his enormous collection of thousands of animals and plants, his books and his maps.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The botanical garden of ''{{lang|nl|Buitenzorg}}'' would soon house Siebold's surviving, living flora collection of 2,000 plants. He arrived in the Netherlands on 7 July 1830. His stay in Japan and Batavia had lasted for a period of eight years.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\n===Return to Europe===\nPhilipp Franz von Siebold arrived in the Netherlands in 1830, just at a time when  political troubles erupted in [[Brussels]], leading soon to [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence]]. Hastily he salvaged his ethnographic collections in [[Antwerp]] and his herbarium specimens in Brussels and took them to [[Leiden]], helped by [[Johann Baptist Fischer]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He left behind his botanical collections of living plants that were sent to the [[University of Ghent]].<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The consequent expansion of this collection of rare and exotic plants led to the horticultural fame of [[Ghent]]. In gratitude the University of Ghent presented him in 1841 with specimens of every plant from his original collection.\n\nSiebold settled in Leiden, taking with him the major part of his collection.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The \"Philipp Franz von Siebold collection\", containing many [[type specimen]]s, was the earliest botanical collection from Japan. Even today, it still remains a subject of ongoing research, a testimony to the depth of work undertaken by Siebold. It contained about 12,000 specimens, from which he could describe only about 2,300 species. The whole collection was purchased for a handsome amount by the Dutch government. Siebold was also granted a substantial annual allowance by the Dutch King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] and was appointed ''Advisor to the King for Japanese Affairs''. In 1842, the King even raised Siebold to the nobility as an esquire.\n\nThe \"Siebold collection\" opened to the public in 1831. He founded a museum in his home in 1837. This small, private museum would eventually evolve into the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]] in Leiden.<ref>{{cite book |author=Willem Otterspeer |year=1989 |title=Leiden Oriental Connections, 1850\u20131940 |volume=5 |series=Studies in the History of Leiden University |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|E. J. Brill]] |isbn=978-90-04-09022-4 |page=389}}</ref> Siebold's successor in Japan, Heinrich B\u00fcrger, sent Siebold three more shipments of herbarium specimens collected in Japan. This flora collection formed the basis of the Japanese collections of the [[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]]<ref>[http://www.nationaalherbarium.nl/ Nationaal Herbarium Nederland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in Leiden, while the zoological specimens Siebold collected were kept by the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]] (''National Museum of Natural History'') in Leiden, which later became Naturalis. Both institutions merged into [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]] in 2010, which now maintains the entire natural history collection that Siebold brought back to Leiden.<ref>[http://www.naturalis.nl/en/ Naturalis Biodiversity Center homepage (in English)]</ref>\n\nIn 1845 Siebold married Helene von Gagern (1820\u20131877), they had three sons and two daughters.\n\n===Writings===\nDuring his stay in Leiden, Siebold wrote ''Nippon'' in 1832, the first part of a volume of a richly illustrated ethnographical and geographical work on Japan. The 'Archiv zur Beschreibung Nippons' also contained a report of his journey to the Shogunate Court at Edo.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> He wrote six further parts, the last ones published posthumously in 1882; his sons published an edited and lower-priced reprint in 1887.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/>\n\n[[File:Cephalotaxus pedunculata SZ132.png|thumb|left|upright|Coloured plate of ''[[Cephalotaxus pedunculata]]'' in ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}'', by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]]\n\nThe ''{{lang|la|Bibliotheca Japonica}}'' appeared between 1833 and 1841. This work was co-authored by Joseph Hoffmann and Kuo Cheng-Chang, a Javanese of Chinese extraction, who had journeyed along with Siebold from Batavia.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> It contained a survey of Japanese literature and a Chinese, Japanese and Korean dictionary.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> Siebold's writing on Japanese religion and customs notably shaped early modern European conceptions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]; he notably suggested that Japanese Buddhism was a form of [[Monotheism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=12\u20134|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}</ref>\n\nThe zoologists [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck|Coenraad Temminck]] (1777\u20131858), [[Hermann Schlegel]] (1804\u20131884), and [[Wilhem de Haan]] (1801\u20131855) scientifically described and documented Siebold's collection of Japanese animals.<ref name=\"Binsbergen\"/> The ''{{lang|la|[[Fauna Japonica]]}}'', a series of monographs published between 1833 and 1850, was mainly based on Siebold's collection, making the Japanese fauna the best-described non-European fauna \u2013 \"a remarkable feat\". A significant part of the ''{{lang|la|Fauna Japonica}}'' was also based on the collections of Siebold's successor on Dejima, [[Heinrich B\u00fcrger]].\n\nSiebold wrote his ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}'' in collaboration with the German botanist [[Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]] (1797\u20131848). It first appeared in 1835, but the work was not completed until after his death, finished in 1870 by F.A.W. Miquel (1811\u20131871), director of the Rijksherbarium in Leiden. This work expanded Siebold's scientific fame from Japan to Europe.\n\nFrom the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]] \u2013 the botanical garden of Leiden \u2013 many of Siebold's plants spread to Europe and from there to other countries. ''Hosta'' and ''[[Hortensia]]'', ''[[Azalea]]'', and the Japanese [[butterbur]] and the [[Petasites|coltsfoot]] as well as the [[Japanese larch]] began to inhabit gardens across the world.\n\n===International endeavours===\n[[File:Coat of arms of von Siebold.png|200px|thumb|Coat of arms of Siebold]]\nAfter his return to Europe, Siebold tried to exploit his knowledge of Japan. Whilst living in [[Boppard]], from 1852 he corresponded with Russian diplomats such as [[Andreas Feodorowitsch Budberg|Baron von Budberg-B\u00f6nninghausen]], the Russian ambassador to [[Prussia]], which resulted in an invitation to go to St Petersburg to advise the Russian government how to open trade relations with Japan. Though still employed by the Dutch government he did not inform the Dutch of this voyage until after his return.\n\nAmerican Naval Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] consulted Siebold in advance of his voyage to Japan in 1854.<ref>{{cite book |author=John S.

He returned to Japan in 1859 as an adviser to the Agent of the Dutch Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) in Nagasaki, Albert Bauduin. After two years the connection with the Trading Society was severed as the advice of Siebold was considered to be of no value. In Nagasaki he fathered another child with one of his female servants.\n\nIn 1861 Siebold organised his appointment as an adviser to the Japanese government and went in that function to Edo. There he tried to obtain a position between the foreign representatives and the Japanese government. As he had been specially admonished by the Dutch authorities before going to Japan that he was to abstain from all interference in politics, the Dutch Consul General in Japan, J.K. de Wit, was ordered to ask Siebold's removal.<ref>{{cite book |author=Herman J.

After he did not succeed in gaining employment with the Russian government, he went to Paris in 1865 to try to interest the French government in funding another expedition to Japan, but failed<ref>The story is told by [[Alphonse Daudet]] in the short story \"L'Empereur aveugle\", part of his book \"Contes du lundi\".</ref>.

Examples include:\n[[File:Malus sieboldii D.jpg|thumb|right|Toringo Crab-Apple (flowering ''Malus sieboldii'')]]\n* ''[[Acer sieboldianum]]'' or Siebold's Maple: a variety of maple native to Japan\n* ''[[Calanthe striata|Calanthe sieboldii]]'' or Siebold's Calanthe is a terrestrial evergreen orchid native to Japan, the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.\n* ''[[Clematis florida]]'' var.

The [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]] in Leiden has recently laid out the \"Von Siebold Memorial Garden\", a Japanese garden with plants sent by Siebold. The garden was laid out under a 150-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata]]'' tree dating from Siebold's lifetime.<ref>A video introduces the Siebold Memorial garden.

Siebold's grave, in the shape of a Buddhist pagoda, is in the ''{{lang|de|Alter M\u00fcnchner S\u00fcdfriedhof}}'' (Former Southern Cemetery of Munich). He is also commemorated in the name of a street and a large number of mentions in the Botanical Garden at Munich.\n* A ''Siebold-Museum'' exists in [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Germany.\n* Nagasaki, Japan, pays tribute to Siebold by housing the [[Siebold Memorial Museum]] on property adjacent to Siebold's former residence in the Narutaki neighborhood, the first museum dedicated to a non-Japanese in Japan.\n\nHis collections laid the foundation for the ethnographic museums of Munich and Leiden. [[Alexander von Siebold]], his son by his European wife, donated much of the material left behind after Siebold's death in W\u00fcrzburg to the [[British Museum]] in London. The Royal Scientific Academy of [[St. Petersburg]] purchased 600 colored plates of the ''{{lang|la|Flora Japonica}}''.\n\nAnother son, [[Heinrich von Siebold|Heinrich (or Henry) von Siebold]] (1852\u20131908), continued part of his father's research.

At the end of the 18th century King [[Rama I]] submitted the city to the Ministry of Defense, which was responsible for all the southern provinces. During the administrative reform by King [[Chulalongkorn]], Phatthalung became part of the [[Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe majority of the province's populace are Thai Buddhists. [[Islam|Muslims]] account for 11.1 percent of the population. Many of Phatthalung's Muslims have some ethnic [[Thai Malays|Malay]] ancestry, but over the centuries they had intermarried with the Thais and adopted Thai cultural norms.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chambers's Journal|author=[[William Chambers (publisher)]], [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]|publisher=[[W. & R.

It was an influence from the south of India, together with Lakhon Chatri (theatrical show by males). However, some dancing patterns were changed to match folk cultures in each province. There are 12 major dancing patterns. The patterns are done to lyrics sung by the dancers, either impromptu or composed in advance.\n\n'''Talung''' (\u0e15\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e07) *shadow plays) is a popular folk performance of the south. Talung puppets are made of dried cattle hide, cut beautifully into the characters of each shadow play. The puppets are usually painted black and each of them is held firmly between split bamboo slats called \"mai tap\". A puppet's mouth and hands will move in accordance with the narration. A Talung ensemble comprises the puppet masters (who are also the vocalists) and a band, totalling no more than eight persons. The musical instruments include pipes, drums, phon (a special kind of drum), and a gong.\n\n==Notes==\nReports (data) from Thai government are \"not copyrightable\" (Public Domain), Copyright Act 2537

[[Islam|Muslims]] account for 11.1 percent of the population. Many of Phatthalung's Muslims have some ethnic [[Thai Malays|Malay]] ancestry, but over the centuries they had intermarried with the Thais and adopted Thai cultural norms.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chambers's Journal|author=[[William Chambers (publisher)]], [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]|publisher=[[W. & R.

A work known as the ''Antidotarium Florentinum'', was published under the authority of the college of medicine of [[Florence]] <ref name=EB1911/>in the 16th century.

Riddle]], one of the foremost experts on [[Materia Medica]]-[[Dioscorides]] works.\n\n[[Nicolaes Tulp]], mayor of [[Amsterdam]] and respected surgeon general, gathered all of his doctor and chemist friends together and they wrote the first pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam in 1636 ''Pharmacopoea Amstelredamensis''. This was a combined effort to improve public health after an outbreak of the plague, and also limit the number of quack apothecary shops in Amsterdam.\n\n====London====\nUntil 1617 such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in [[England]] by the [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary\u2019s shop. The preparation of physicians\u2019 prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7&nbsp;m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized [[London]] Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be so full of errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAt this period the compounds employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs\u2019 eyes (i.e., [[gastrolith]]s), pearls, oyster shells, and [[Coral#Relation to humans|coral]] were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]], human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, [[earthworm]]s, etc.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAlthough other editions of the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir [[Hans Sloane]], that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs\u2019 excrement, earthworms, and [[moss]] from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, [[Cordial (medicine)|cordial]]s and [[ratafia]]s were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the principal remedies of physicians for 2,000 years were discarded, while a few powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the Pharmacopoeia of 1765 were restored to their previous position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published in 1824, 1836, and 1851.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first ''[[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia]]'' was published in 1699 and the last in 1841; the first'' Dublin Pharmacopoeia'' in 1807 and the last in 1850.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===National pharmacopoeia origins===\nThe preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the [[Medical Act of 1858]] ordained that the [[General Medical Council]] should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the ''[[British Pharmacopoeia]]'', which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the fact that the majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThere are national and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia \u2013 National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 under the authority of a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees.<ref>http://www.usp.org/about-usp/our-impact</ref>  In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or misbranded under the Federal food and drug laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/about-usp/legal-recognition|title=USP in Food and Drug Law - U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention|work=usp.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Supranational and international harmonization===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] had a nominally supranational pharmacopoeia, the State Pharmacopoeia of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSRP), although the [[de facto]] nature of the nationality of republics within that state differed from the [[de jure]] nature. The [[European Union]] has a supranational pharmacopoeia, the [[European Pharmacopoeia]]; it has not replaced the national pharmacopoeias of EU member states but rather helps to harmonize them. Attempts have been made by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis on which a globally international pharmacopoeia could be prepared,<ref name=EB1911/> but regulatory complexity and locoregional variation in conditions of pharmacy are hurdles to fully harmonizing across all countries (that is, defining thousands of details that can all be known to work successfully in all places). Nonetheless, some progress has been made under the banner of the [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org|title=ICH Official web site : ICH|work=ich.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> a tri-regional organisation that represents the drug regulatory authorities of the [[European Medicines Agency|European Union]], [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Japan]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States]]. Representatives from the Pharmacopoeias of these three regions have met twice yearly since 1990 in the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group to try to work towards \"compendial harmonisation\". Specific monographs are proposed, and if accepted, proceed through stages of review and consultation leading to adoption of a common monograph that provides a common set of tests and specifications for a specific material. Not surprisingly, this is a slow process. The [[World Health Organization]] has produced the [[The International Pharmacopoeia|International Pharmacopoeia]] (Ph.Int.), which does not replace a national pharmacopoeia but rather provides a model or template for one and also can be invoked by legislation within a country to serve as that country's regulation.\n\n==Medical preparations, uses, and dosages==\n[[File:Glycerin bottle.jpg|thumb|A bottle of glycerin purchased at a pharmacy with the abbreviation [[Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission|I.P.]] appearing after the product name.]]\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=March 2012}}\nThough formerly printed there has been a transition to a situation where pharmaceutical information is available as printed volumes and on the [[internet]]. The rapid increase in knowledge renders necessary frequent new editions, to furnish definite formulae for preparations that have already come into extensive use in medical practice, so as to ensure uniformity of strength, and to give the characters and tests by which their purity and potency may be determined. However each new edition requires several years to carry out numerous experiments for devising suitable formulae, so that current pharmacopoeia are never quite up to date.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis difficulty has hitherto been met by the publication of such non-official formularies as ''Squire's Companion to the Pharmacopoeia'' and ''[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]]'' (formerly ''Martindale's: the extra pharmacopoeia''), in which all new remedies and their preparations, uses and doses are recorded, and in the former the varying strengths of the same preparations in the different pharmacopoeias are also compared (Squire's was incorporated into Martindale in 1952). The need of such works to supplement the Pharmacopoeia is shown by the fact that they are even more largely used than the Pharmacopoeia itself, the first issued in 18 editions and the second in 13 editions at comparatively short intervals. In the UK, the task of elaborating a new Pharmacopoeia is entrusted to a body of a purely medical character, and legally the pharmacist does not, contrary to the practice in other countries, have a voice in the matter. This is notwithstanding the fact that, although the medical practitioner is naturally the best judge of the drug or preparations that will afford the best therapeutic result, they are not as competent as the pharmacist to say how that preparation can be produced in the most effective and satisfactory manner, nor how the purity of drugs can be tested.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe change occurred with the fourth edition of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1898. A committee of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] was appointed at the request of the [[General Medical Council]] to advise on pharmaceutical matters. A census of prescriptions was taken to ascertain the relative frequency with which different preparations and drugs were used in prescriptions, and suggestions and criticisms were sought from various medical and pharmaceutical bodies across the [[British Empire]]. As regards the purely pharmaceutical part of the work a committee of reference in pharmacy, nominated by the pharmaceutical societies of Great Britain and Ireland (as they were then), was appointed to report to the Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Medical Council.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nSome difficulty has arisen since the passing of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only \"intended to afford to the members of the medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined\". It cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can be used only as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as [[sulfur|sulphur]], [[gum benzoin]], [[tragacanth]], [[gum arabic]], [[ammonium carbonate]], [[beeswax]], oil of [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified [[potassium nitrate]], and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called ''Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs'' by C.&nbsp;G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAn important step has also been taken in this direction by the publication under the authority of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain of the ''[[British Pharmaceutical Codex]]'' (BPC), in which the characters of and tests for the purity of many unofficial drugs and preparations are given as well as the character of many glandular preparations and antitoxins that have come into use in medicine, but have not yet been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia. This work may also possibly serve as a standard under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act for the purity and strength of drugs not included in the Pharmacopoeia and as a standard for the commercial grade of purity of those in the Pharmacopoeia which are used for non-medical purposes.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAnother legal difficulty connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion in some of them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a [[medical prescription|prescription]] to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the [[patent]]ees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were to use the same article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the ''British Pharmaceutical Codex''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==List of national and supranational pharmacopoeias ==\nIn most of the [[New Latin]] names, ''Pharmacopoea'' is the more common spelling, although for several of them, ''Pharmacopoeia'' is common.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

A work known as the ''Antidotarium Florentinum'', was published under the authority of the college of medicine of [[Florence]] <ref name=EB1911/>in the 16th century. In 1511, the ''Concordie Apothecariorum Barchinone'' was published by the Society of Apothecaries of [[Barcelona]] and kept in the School of [[Pharmacy]] of the [[University of Barcelona]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.edu/museuvirtual/exposiciovirtual.php?id=7&ap=1&idGal=5#1|title=Museu Virtual - Universitat de Barcelona|author=|date=|website=www.ub.edu}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:Engraved frontispiece, Pharmacopoeia Bateana.

Riddle]], one of the foremost experts on [[Materia Medica]]-[[Dioscorides]] works.\n\n[[Nicolaes Tulp]], mayor of [[Amsterdam]] and respected surgeon general, gathered all of his doctor and chemist friends together and they wrote the first pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam in 1636 ''Pharmacopoea Amstelredamensis''. This was a combined effort to improve public health after an outbreak of the plague, and also limit the number of quack apothecary shops in Amsterdam.\n\n====London====\nUntil 1617 such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in [[England]] by the [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary\u2019s shop. The preparation of physicians\u2019 prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7&nbsp;m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized [[London]] Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be so full of errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAt this period the compounds employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs\u2019 eyes (i.e., [[gastrolith]]s), pearls, oyster shells, and [[Coral#Relation to humans|coral]] were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]], human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, [[earthworm]]s, etc.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAlthough other editions of the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir [[Hans Sloane]], that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs\u2019 excrement, earthworms, and [[moss]] from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, [[Cordial (medicine)|cordial]]s and [[ratafia]]s were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the principal remedies of physicians for 2,000 years were discarded, while a few powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the Pharmacopoeia of 1765 were restored to their previous position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published in 1824, 1836, and 1851.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first ''[[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia]]'' was published in 1699 and the last in 1841; the first'' Dublin Pharmacopoeia'' in 1807 and the last in 1850.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===National pharmacopoeia origins===\nThe preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the [[Medical Act of 1858]] ordained that the [[General Medical Council]] should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the ''[[British Pharmacopoeia]]'', which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the fact that the majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThere are national and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia \u2013 National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 under the authority of a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees.<ref>http://www.usp.org/about-usp/our-impact</ref>  In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or misbranded under the Federal food and drug laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/about-usp/legal-recognition|title=USP in Food and Drug Law - U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention|work=usp.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Supranational and international harmonization===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] had a nominally supranational pharmacopoeia, the State Pharmacopoeia of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSRP), although the [[de facto]] nature of the nationality of republics within that state differed from the [[de jure]] nature. The [[European Union]] has a supranational pharmacopoeia, the [[European Pharmacopoeia]]; it has not replaced the national pharmacopoeias of EU member states but rather helps to harmonize them. Attempts have been made by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis on which a globally international pharmacopoeia could be prepared,<ref name=EB1911/> but regulatory complexity and locoregional variation in conditions of pharmacy are hurdles to fully harmonizing across all countries (that is, defining thousands of details that can all be known to work successfully in all places). Nonetheless, some progress has been made under the banner of the [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org|title=ICH Official web site : ICH|work=ich.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> a tri-regional organisation that represents the drug regulatory authorities of the [[European Medicines Agency|European Union]], [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Japan]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States]]. Representatives from the Pharmacopoeias of these three regions have met twice yearly since 1990 in the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group to try to work towards \"compendial harmonisation\". Specific monographs are proposed, and if accepted, proceed through stages of review and consultation leading to adoption of a common monograph that provides a common set of tests and specifications for a specific material. Not surprisingly, this is a slow process. The [[World Health Organization]] has produced the [[The International Pharmacopoeia|International Pharmacopoeia]] (Ph.Int.), which does not replace a national pharmacopoeia but rather provides a model or template for one and also can be invoked by legislation within a country to serve as that country's regulation.\n\n==Medical preparations, uses, and dosages==\n[[File:Glycerin bottle.jpg|thumb|A bottle of glycerin purchased at a pharmacy with the abbreviation [[Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission|I.P.]] appearing after the product name.]]\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=March 2012}}\nThough formerly printed there has been a transition to a situation where pharmaceutical information is available as printed volumes and on the [[internet]]. The rapid increase in knowledge renders necessary frequent new editions, to furnish definite formulae for preparations that have already come into extensive use in medical practice, so as to ensure uniformity of strength, and to give the characters and tests by which their purity and potency may be determined. However each new edition requires several years to carry out numerous experiments for devising suitable formulae, so that current pharmacopoeia are never quite up to date.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis difficulty has hitherto been met by the publication of such non-official formularies as ''Squire's Companion to the Pharmacopoeia'' and ''[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]]'' (formerly ''Martindale's: the extra pharmacopoeia''), in which all new remedies and their preparations, uses and doses are recorded, and in the former the varying strengths of the same preparations in the different pharmacopoeias are also compared (Squire's was incorporated into Martindale in 1952). The need of such works to supplement the Pharmacopoeia is shown by the fact that they are even more largely used than the Pharmacopoeia itself, the first issued in 18 editions and the second in 13 editions at comparatively short intervals. In the UK, the task of elaborating a new Pharmacopoeia is entrusted to a body of a purely medical character, and legally the pharmacist does not, contrary to the practice in other countries, have a voice in the matter. This is notwithstanding the fact that, although the medical practitioner is naturally the best judge of the drug or preparations that will afford the best therapeutic result, they are not as competent as the pharmacist to say how that preparation can be produced in the most effective and satisfactory manner, nor how the purity of drugs can be tested.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe change occurred with the fourth edition of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1898. A committee of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] was appointed at the request of the [[General Medical Council]] to advise on pharmaceutical matters. A census of prescriptions was taken to ascertain the relative frequency with which different preparations and drugs were used in prescriptions, and suggestions and criticisms were sought from various medical and pharmaceutical bodies across the [[British Empire]]. As regards the purely pharmaceutical part of the work a committee of reference in pharmacy, nominated by the pharmaceutical societies of Great Britain and Ireland (as they were then), was appointed to report to the Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Medical Council.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nSome difficulty has arisen since the passing of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only \"intended to afford to the members of the medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined\". It cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can be used only as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as [[sulfur|sulphur]], [[gum benzoin]], [[tragacanth]], [[gum arabic]], [[ammonium carbonate]], [[beeswax]], oil of [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified [[potassium nitrate]], and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called ''Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs'' by C.&nbsp;G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAn important step has also been taken in this direction by the publication under the authority of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain of the ''[[British Pharmaceutical Codex]]'' (BPC), in which the characters of and tests for the purity of many unofficial drugs and preparations are given as well as the character of many glandular preparations and antitoxins that have come into use in medicine, but have not yet been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia. This work may also possibly serve as a standard under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act for the purity and strength of drugs not included in the Pharmacopoeia and as a standard for the commercial grade of purity of those in the Pharmacopoeia which are used for non-medical purposes.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAnother legal difficulty connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion in some of them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a [[medical prescription|prescription]] to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the [[patent]]ees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were to use the same article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the ''British Pharmaceutical Codex''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==List of national and supranational pharmacopoeias ==\nIn most of the [[New Latin]] names, ''Pharmacopoea'' is the more common spelling, although for several of them, ''Pharmacopoeia'' is common.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It replaced the [[Peugeot 309|309]]. Peugeot gave the 306 many updates and aesthetic changes to keep up with the competition, and it was replaced by the [[Peugeot 307|307]] in 2001. [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] and [[station wagon|estate]] versions continued until 2002. Versions were built in [[Argentina]] by [[Sevel Argentina S.A.|Sevel]] from 1996 to 2002.\n\n==Background==\nThe 306 was developed between 1990 and 1992 for a launch at the beginning of 1993. It was a replacement for the [[Peugeot 309]] (which had broken with Peugeot's normal ascending numbering system partly due to it being released before the older and larger [[Peugeot 305]] was axed).\n\nConcept versions of the 306 were first seen around the end of 1990, although the motoring press initially reported that it was going to replace the smaller [[Peugeot 205|205]]. However, by the end of 1991, Peugeot had confirmed that the new car was going to replace the 309, as well as some versions of the 205, which was going to remain in production for several more years, despite the launch of the entry-level [[Peugeot 106|106]] supermini in September 1991.\n\nMechanically, the 306 is virtually identical to the [[Citro\u00ebn ZX]], which was launched two years before the 306: both cars use the same floorpan and core structure. The 306, with its attractive [[Peugeot 205]] derived [[Pininfarina]] styling, was a more successful car than its twin. The [[Citro\u00ebn Berlingo]] and [[Peugeot Partner]] were also built on the same platform. The chassis used by the 306 and ZX was also used in the ZX's replacement, the [[Citro\u00ebn Xsara]]. The sharing of platforms between [[Peugeot]] and [[Citro\u00ebn]] has been parent company [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] policy since the late 1970s, after the Peugeot takeover of the then bankrupt Citro\u00ebn in the wake of the 1974 oil crisis. The first example was the [[Peugeot 104]]-based [[Citro\u00ebn Visa]] and [[Citro\u00ebn LNA]] (and the [[Talbot Samba]]). The policy continues today throughout the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn ranges. The entry level [[Peugeot 108]], [[Citro\u00ebn C1]] and [[Toyota Aygo]] are all based on the same Toyota design, though, and not a PSA one.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==306 Phase 1==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = Peugeot 306 front 20080118.jpg\n|name           = Phase 1\n| production  = 1993\u20131997\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1124&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU1|TU1]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' I4\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7]]'' I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]]'' I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1769&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD7|XUD7&#8239;TE]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9]]'' I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9&#8239;TE]]'' TD I4\n  }}\n}}\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20080118.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 rear]]\n\nThe 306 was released in March 1993 as a 3- and 5-door hatchback, with [[sedan (car)|saloon]] and [[cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] models being introduced a year later. The Phase 1 model was known as the N3 in Australia and was introduced in 1994.\n\nA bewildering array of different model types were offered during the life of the Phase 1 model, including Genoa, XSS, XT, XRdt and XLd. Later were added various 'performance' models, such as the S16, XSi and GTI-6 (petrol) and the D-Turbo S (diesel).\n\nAll variants of the 306, with the exception of the GTI-6 and cabriolet models, were priced very competitively.\n\n===Petrol engines===\nThe initial petrol engines used were proven four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] units, which had gained a solid reputation in Peugeot models such as the [[Peugeot 205|205]], 309 and [[Peugeot 405|405]]. At first, all mainstream models were powered by derivatives of the [[PSA TU engine|TU]] series 8-valve engine, in 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.6-litre guises. The 1.1 was dropped quickly, but the 1.4 and particularly the 1.6 variants sold well, the latter offering a good balance between performance and economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/index.htm?md=295 |title=Car review: Peugeot 306 (1993 - 2001) |publisher=Honestjohn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThree larger-capacity units were available, but restricted to automatic and performance models. These engines were developments of the larger [[PSA XU engine|XU]] series units which had been used in the 205 GTi 1.9, and larger 405 models. A 1.8-litre version powered cars with both manual (not many 1.8 manuals were produced) and automatic transmission, while two versions of the 2.0-litre engine in 8- and 16-valve guises powered the XSi and S16 models respectively. In Australia, the only engines available were the 1.8 and 2.0&nbsp;L engines.\n\n===Diesel engines===\nPeugeot had an excellent reputation for its diesel engines,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/special-report-on-diesel-cars-a-touch-of-class-for-the-market-cinderella-a-oncepoor-relation-is-joining-the-luxury-cars-writes-martin-derrick-1459523.html|title=Special Report on Diesel Cars|author=Martin Derrick|date=August 6, 1993|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref> and the 306 was originally offered with the [[XUD]] series diesel engine in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] forms. This engine was initially a 1769&nbsp;cc unit, but its capacity was soon enlarged to 1905&nbsp;cc. The turbocharged version quickly gained a reputation for being a good match for the exceptional handling of the 306. Not only did its outright performance match many similarly sized petrol cars &ndash; almost certainly a first for an affordable mainstream diesel &ndash; but the carefully designed installation ensured its considerable extra weight did not upset the car's handling. The Indirect Injection [[XUD]] Diesel that uses the [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] Comet combustion chamber design, is popular for conversion to run on vegetable oil, as long as the Bosch Fuel System is fitted to the engine.<ref>http://www.dieselbob.co.uk/goodbad.aspx</ref>\n\n===Chassis design===\nThe familiar range of PSA powertrains drove the front wheels of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard [[MacPherson strut]] layout with [[anti-roll bar]], while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the [[Peugeot 305]] estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.<ref>http://www.citroen-owners-club.co.uk/citroen/index.php?/topic/10225-zx-volcane-rear-suspension/</ref><ref>http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/forum/post/index.htm?t=17115</ref><ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/122038287/Citroen-ZX-Suspension-and-steering</ref><ref>http://www.frenchcarforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=129058</ref><ref>http://www.sspengineering.co.uk/</ref> The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted as far back as possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising [[understeer]].\n\n===Versions===\nTrim levels were XN, XL, XR, XT and XS; XN being the most basic, and XT the highest specification. The XT was available in 5-door only, with the XR, XN and XL available in 3-door too. The D-Turbo and XSi were available in both 3- and 5-door, the XS and S16 only available in 3-door. There were no longer \"X/G\" designations (\"X\" indicating a 3-door, \"G\" indicating a 5-door). A diesel model could be identified with the addition of \"d\" after the spec level, and a [[turbodiesel]] with the addition of \"dt\". There were special edition versions too, badged \"Alpine\" from 1994. (3-door only).\n\n====Sedan models====\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20070918.jpg|thumb|Peugeot 306 ''Sedan'' saloon]]\n\nSedan specification was marked as SN, SL, SR, and ST. The sedan model, for many motorists provided an alternative to the domination of the car markets by hatchbacks.\n\n====Performance models====\nPeugeot created a D-Turbo \"hot hatch\" version, which was essentially a petrol XS model with the diesel unit installed. The 306 was not the first mainstream affordable performance diesel, with that plaudit arguably going to the MkII VW Golf GTD of the mid-1980s. However, the 306 D-turbo was the first to be commercially successful and sell in significant numbers, and this success effectively created the market for such performance oriented diesel cars. It was a popular seller in all its various phases throughout the life of the car.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most D-Turbo cars were 3 door models, but there are a few rare examples of the 5-door D-Turbo.\n\nThe D-Turbo and XS variants were fitted as standard with front fog lights, body-coloured bumpers with deeper spoilers, sports seats and different steering wheel, and a wider, chromed exhaust tailpipe; 14-inch alloy wheels were an optional extra. The models fitted somewhere between the XR and XT variants in terms of standard equipment.\n\nThe XSi 8v 2.0 Petrol had the addition of subtle side skirts. 15-inch five spoke alloy wheels were available as an option when the model was launched, and became standard shortly after.\n\nThe S16 (for 'soupape-16', or '16-valve') was a 3-door Phase 1-only model, replaced with the more powerful GTI-6 in 1996. The engines in both cars were 16-valve XU-series units with Magnetti Marelli fuel injection and produced excellent power and torque outputs for the time. As well as gaining a close-ratio 6-speed gearbox over the S16's 5-speed, the GTI-6 had more power courtesy of a reworked 167&nbsp;bhp XU10J4RS engine replacing the S16's 155&nbsp;bhp XU10J4 ACAV,<ref>http://www.pugaddicts.co.uk/2012/02/xu10j4rs-engine-information.html</ref> and some subtle chassis revisions. As well as being more powerful, the GTI-6 engine had more flexible power delivery with more mid-range torque than that in the S16, and the new gearbox made it easier to use the engine more effectively. The GTI-6 was introduced as a Phase 1 model and was to last until the end of 2000. It received Phase 2 and 3 cosmetic and electrical updates alongside the rest of the range, but the engine and mechanical specification remained largely unchanged.\n\nA UK-only model was the 306 Rallye of 1999. Mechanically the car was identical to a GTI-6, but had a minimal specification that deleted many GTI-6 standard features including fog lights, air conditioning, sunroof, electric windows, temperature sensor. Only 500 were produced in 3 non-metallic colours including; 100 in black, 200 in Cherry Red and 200 in Bianca White. While some were fitted with Phase 3 tailgates and bonnets, the car was basically a Phase 2 in terms of the fuse box and electrical wiring loom, including the use of Phase 2 remote locking. Seat upholstery was cloth in a specific Rallye pattern. The more austere specification led to the car being lighter than a GTI-6.\n\n==306 Phase 2==\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=May 2010}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = Peugeot 306 front 20080822.jpg\n|name           = Phase 2 (N5)\n| production  = 1997\u20131999\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7]]'' I4 (automatic)\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7&#8239;JP4]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9]]'' I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9&#8239;TE]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe 306 underwent the only major revamp of its life in May 1997, with the launch of the \"Phase 2\" version (N5 in Australia). The basic shape remained the same, but lights, grille and bumpers were redesigned in an effort to bring the styling into line with the new, more rounded, Peugeot family look established with the [[Peugeot 406]]. Indicator lamps were now incorporated into the headlamp unit and the new style \"block filled\" Peugeot lion logo was adopted. The Phase 2 also saw the addition of an estate version.\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20080822.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 2 Peugeot 306 rear]]\n[[File:Peugeot 306 break darkred hl.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 2 Peugeot 306 break]]\n[[File:2001 Peugeot 306 (N5) convertible (24968645956).jpg|thumb|left|1999\u20132002 Peugeot 306 (N5) cabriolet, Australia]]\n\nA new-style typeface for the car's model number was adopted on the tailgate, removing the black plastic backing. There were also some changes to the dashboard layout, including a digital odometer, and trim quality which freshened up the car in the face of increasingly stiff competition from other manufacturers. New engines were also offered, with both 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines gaining 16-valve cylinder heads together with modest power increases. At this time, the previous trim designations were replaced by L, LX & GLX for the UK market. XS, XSi and GTI-6 models continued as before, but with the Phase 2 headlight, grille, bumper and other cosmetic updates alongside the rest of the range.\n\nCars from 1998 onwards (1999 model year) received further enhancements, including an aluminium-effect centre console on certain versions and a chrome Peugeot logo on the steering wheel. Other updates included removal of the black strip on the bootlid, colour-coded bumpers on some models and new upholstery in the cabin.\n\nNew models also appeared in Phase 2 trim. Sold only in the UK, the Rallye was launched in 1998 using the mechanicals from the GTI-6, but with less standard equipment (manual windows and mirrors, no air-con, Rallye-specific cloth instead of leather and alcantara, front spot lights removed), making it {{convert|65|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter than the GTI-6. Sold at a discounted price of \u00a315,995 (over \u00a32000 less than a GTI-6), it only came in four colours - black, Cherry Red and Bianca White and one only in Dragoon Blue - and there were only 501 produced. The only drawback is the insurance costs as the Rallye is in group 16. As the production of the Rallye straddled the Phase 2 and 3 models, some Rallyes had superficial Phase 3 features such as the flush glass tailgate and slightly different bonnet, but remained fundamentally a Phase 2 model in such characteristics as the fuse box and electrical layout. The UK Rallye is different from the 2001 Australian market N5 Rallye, which was based on the 5-door XT model. In 1998 Peugeot has launched SP version - denotes sport pack, there have 3 different levels of equipment.\n\nThe ''Meridian'' model (originally a special edition) was also relaunched in 1999 and boasted a generous equipment list including new half-leather seats, and further cosmetic upgrades to the interior.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==306 Phase 3==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = 2000 Peugeot 306 Meridian 1.6.jpg\n|name           = Phase 3\n| production  = 1999\u20132002\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7&#8239;JP4]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1868&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA EW/DW engine#DW8|DW8A]]'' I4\n  | 1997&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA EW/DW engine#DW10|DW10A]]'' [[common rail]] [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  }}\n}}\n\n[[File:Peugeot 306 3p.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 3 Peugeot 306 3-door]]\n[[File:2000 Peugeot 306 L Estate 1.4 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 Break]]\n[[File:Peugeot 306 (rear left), Denpasar.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 sedan]]\n\nModels from mid-1999 saw further improvements and exterior modifications, including clear lenses on the headlamps, round and clear lensed foglamps, complete colour-coding of the exterior trim, removal of the black plastic strip on the lower edge of the tailgate, flush glass seal to rear windscreen, a redesigned tailgate rear badge, different rear wiper and new paint colours. Interior upgrades were more minor, with the gearknob becoming rounder and silver topped, while the instrument binnacle received a silver background and white instrument needles in place of the previous red versions.\n\nXSi, XT and D Turbo models all received the GTi-6's bodykit and interior styling additions but not the cyclone alloy wheels. In the diesel variants, the ageing [[PSA XUD|XUD engine]] was replaced by the newer, [[HDi]] engine, which featured common rail injection. Some base models made use of the [[PSA EW/DW engine#DW8|DW8]] normally aspirated diesel engine. Almost all models included [[Anti-lock Braking System|ABS]] and multiple [[airbags]] as standard equipment. Rain sensitive automatic windscreen wipers were also standard on all but the base spec.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==The end of the line==\nDespite Peugeot's efforts, the car placed poorly in a variety of ownership and customer satisfaction surveys of the time, such as the annual [[JD Power]] survey<ref name=\"JDPOWER\">{{cite web|url=http://bbs.scoobynet.com/scoobynet-general-1/9500-jd-power-2001-full-results-table.html|title=2001 JD Power survey of cars registered between August 1998 and August 1999|work=jdpower.com}}</ref> which was run in association with the [[BBC]] ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' television programme. Nevertheless, the car featured in the ''Top 10 Best Selling Cars In Britain'' from 1994 to 1998, and only narrowly missing out on the top 10 during its final three years on sale. Sales in France and most of the rest of Europe were also strong.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn Australia a run-out model was introduced in early 2001.<ref>GoAuto.com.au - Peugeot aims to Rallye sales: Peugeot is offering a special edition 306 at a special price 18 April 2001 By BRUCE NEWTON http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1ED1EA6FB6A56B44CA256A3200292987</ref> Based on the N5 XT 5-door model, it was called the 306 Rallye.

This model was different from the 306 Rallye sold in the UK in 1998 - 99, which was a 3-door car based on the 306 GTI-6.\n\nThe hatchback 306 was discontinued in 2001 to make way for its replacement, the [[Peugeot 307]]. The cabriolet and estate variants both remained on sale until 2002. The slow\u2013selling saloon was axed from the [[United Kingdom]] market in 1999, but it was still available in the rest of Europe until 2002.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Motorsport==\n[[File:Peugeot 306 Kit Car.

It replaced the [[Peugeot 309|309]]. Peugeot gave the 306 many updates and aesthetic changes to keep up with the competition, and it was replaced by the [[Peugeot 307|307]] in 2001. [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] and [[station wagon|estate]] versions continued until 2002. Versions were built in [[Argentina]] by [[Sevel Argentina S.A.|Sevel]] from 1996 to 2002.\n\n==Background==\nThe 306 was developed between 1990 and 1992 for a launch at the beginning of 1993. It was a replacement for the [[Peugeot 309]] (which had broken with Peugeot's normal ascending numbering system partly due to it being released before the older and larger [[Peugeot 305]] was axed).\n\nConcept versions of the 306 were first seen around the end of 1990, although the motoring press initially reported that it was going to replace the smaller [[Peugeot 205|205]]. However, by the end of 1991, Peugeot had confirmed that the new car was going to replace the 309, as well as some versions of the 205, which was going to remain in production for several more years, despite the launch of the entry-level [[Peugeot 106|106]] supermini in September 1991.\n\nMechanically, the 306 is virtually identical to the [[Citro\u00ebn ZX]], which was launched two years before the 306: both cars use the same floorpan and core structure. The 306, with its attractive [[Peugeot 205]] derived [[Pininfarina]] styling, was a more successful car than its twin. The [[Citro\u00ebn Berlingo]] and [[Peugeot Partner]] were also built on the same platform. The chassis used by the 306 and ZX was also used in the ZX's replacement, the [[Citro\u00ebn Xsara]]. The sharing of platforms between [[Peugeot]] and [[Citro\u00ebn]] has been parent company [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] policy since the late 1970s, after the Peugeot takeover of the then bankrupt Citro\u00ebn in the wake of the 1974 oil crisis. The first example was the [[Peugeot 104]]-based [[Citro\u00ebn Visa]] and [[Citro\u00ebn LNA]] (and the [[Talbot Samba]]). The policy continues today throughout the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn ranges. The entry level [[Peugeot 108]], [[Citro\u00ebn C1]] and [[Toyota Aygo]] are all based on the same Toyota design, though, and not a PSA one.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==306 Phase 1==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = Peugeot 306 front 20080118.jpg\n|name           = Phase 1\n| production  = 1993\u20131997\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1124&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU1|TU1]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' I4\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7]]'' I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]]'' I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1769&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD7|XUD7&#8239;TE]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9]]'' I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9&#8239;TE]]'' TD I4\n  }}\n}}\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20080118.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 rear]]\n\nThe 306 was released in March 1993 as a 3- and 5-door hatchback, with [[sedan (car)|saloon]] and [[cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] models being introduced a year later. The Phase 1 model was known as the N3 in Australia and was introduced in 1994.\n\nA bewildering array of different model types were offered during the life of the Phase 1 model, including Genoa, XSS, XT, XRdt and XLd. Later were added various 'performance' models, such as the S16, XSi and GTI-6 (petrol) and the D-Turbo S (diesel).\n\nAll variants of the 306, with the exception of the GTI-6 and cabriolet models, were priced very competitively.\n\n===Petrol engines===\nThe initial petrol engines used were proven four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] units, which had gained a solid reputation in Peugeot models such as the [[Peugeot 205|205]], 309 and [[Peugeot 405|405]]. At first, all mainstream models were powered by derivatives of the [[PSA TU engine|TU]] series 8-valve engine, in 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.6-litre guises. The 1.1 was dropped quickly, but the 1.4 and particularly the 1.6 variants sold well, the latter offering a good balance between performance and economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/index.htm?md=295 |title=Car review: Peugeot 306 (1993 - 2001) |publisher=Honestjohn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThree larger-capacity units were available, but restricted to automatic and performance models. These engines were developments of the larger [[PSA XU engine|XU]] series units which had been used in the 205 GTi 1.9, and larger 405 models. A 1.8-litre version powered cars with both manual (not many 1.8 manuals were produced) and automatic transmission, while two versions of the 2.0-litre engine in 8- and 16-valve guises powered the XSi and S16 models respectively. In Australia, the only engines available were the 1.8 and 2.0&nbsp;L engines.\n\n===Diesel engines===\nPeugeot had an excellent reputation for its diesel engines,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/special-report-on-diesel-cars-a-touch-of-class-for-the-market-cinderella-a-oncepoor-relation-is-joining-the-luxury-cars-writes-martin-derrick-1459523.html|title=Special Report on Diesel Cars|author=Martin Derrick|date=August 6, 1993|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref> and the 306 was originally offered with the [[XUD]] series diesel engine in both normally aspirated and [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] forms. This engine was initially a 1769&nbsp;cc unit, but its capacity was soon enlarged to 1905&nbsp;cc. The turbocharged version quickly gained a reputation for being a good match for the exceptional handling of the 306. Not only did its outright performance match many similarly sized petrol cars &ndash; almost certainly a first for an affordable mainstream diesel &ndash; but the carefully designed installation ensured its considerable extra weight did not upset the car's handling. The Indirect Injection [[XUD]] Diesel that uses the [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] Comet combustion chamber design, is popular for conversion to run on vegetable oil, as long as the Bosch Fuel System is fitted to the engine.<ref>http://www.dieselbob.co.uk/goodbad.aspx</ref>\n\n===Chassis design===\nThe familiar range of PSA powertrains drove the front wheels of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard [[MacPherson strut]] layout with [[anti-roll bar]], while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the [[Peugeot 305]] estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.<ref>http://www.citroen-owners-club.co.uk/citroen/index.php?/topic/10225-zx-volcane-rear-suspension/</ref><ref>http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/forum/post/index.htm?t=17115</ref><ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/122038287/Citroen-ZX-Suspension-and-steering</ref><ref>http://www.frenchcarforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=129058</ref><ref>http://www.sspengineering.co.uk/</ref> The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted as far back as possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising [[understeer]].\n\n===Versions===\nTrim levels were XN, XL, XR, XT and XS; XN being the most basic, and XT the highest specification. The XT was available in 5-door only, with the XR, XN and XL available in 3-door too. The D-Turbo and XSi were available in both 3- and 5-door, the XS and S16 only available in 3-door. There were no longer \"X/G\" designations (\"X\" indicating a 3-door, \"G\" indicating a 5-door). A diesel model could be identified with the addition of \"d\" after the spec level, and a [[turbodiesel]] with the addition of \"dt\". There were special edition versions too, badged \"Alpine\" from 1994. (3-door only).\n\n====Sedan models====\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20070918.jpg|thumb|Peugeot 306 ''Sedan'' saloon]]\n\nSedan specification was marked as SN, SL, SR, and ST. The sedan model, for many motorists provided an alternative to the domination of the car markets by hatchbacks.\n\n====Performance models====\nPeugeot created a D-Turbo \"hot hatch\" version, which was essentially a petrol XS model with the diesel unit installed. The 306 was not the first mainstream affordable performance diesel, with that plaudit arguably going to the MkII VW Golf GTD of the mid-1980s. However, the 306 D-turbo was the first to be commercially successful and sell in significant numbers, and this success effectively created the market for such performance oriented diesel cars. It was a popular seller in all its various phases throughout the life of the car.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most D-Turbo cars were 3 door models, but there are a few rare examples of the 5-door D-Turbo.\n\nThe D-Turbo and XS variants were fitted as standard with front fog lights, body-coloured bumpers with deeper spoilers, sports seats and different steering wheel, and a wider, chromed exhaust tailpipe; 14-inch alloy wheels were an optional extra. The models fitted somewhere between the XR and XT variants in terms of standard equipment.\n\nThe XSi 8v 2.0 Petrol had the addition of subtle side skirts. 15-inch five spoke alloy wheels were available as an option when the model was launched, and became standard shortly after.\n\nThe S16 (for 'soupape-16', or '16-valve') was a 3-door Phase 1-only model, replaced with the more powerful GTI-6 in 1996. The engines in both cars were 16-valve XU-series units with Magnetti Marelli fuel injection and produced excellent power and torque outputs for the time. As well as gaining a close-ratio 6-speed gearbox over the S16's 5-speed, the GTI-6 had more power courtesy of a reworked 167&nbsp;bhp XU10J4RS engine replacing the S16's 155&nbsp;bhp XU10J4 ACAV,<ref>http://www.pugaddicts.co.uk/2012/02/xu10j4rs-engine-information.html</ref> and some subtle chassis revisions. As well as being more powerful, the GTI-6 engine had more flexible power delivery with more mid-range torque than that in the S16, and the new gearbox made it easier to use the engine more effectively. The GTI-6 was introduced as a Phase 1 model and was to last until the end of 2000. It received Phase 2 and 3 cosmetic and electrical updates alongside the rest of the range, but the engine and mechanical specification remained largely unchanged.\n\nA UK-only model was the 306 Rallye of 1999. Mechanically the car was identical to a GTI-6, but had a minimal specification that deleted many GTI-6 standard features including fog lights, air conditioning, sunroof, electric windows, temperature sensor. Only 500 were produced in 3 non-metallic colours including; 100 in black, 200 in Cherry Red and 200 in Bianca White. While some were fitted with Phase 3 tailgates and bonnets, the car was basically a Phase 2 in terms of the fuse box and electrical wiring loom, including the use of Phase 2 remote locking. Seat upholstery was cloth in a specific Rallye pattern. The more austere specification led to the car being lighter than a GTI-6.\n\n==306 Phase 2==\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=May 2010}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = Peugeot 306 front 20080822.jpg\n|name           = Phase 2 (N5)\n| production  = 1997\u20131999\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7]]'' I4 (automatic)\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7&#8239;JP4]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9]]'' I4\n  | 1905&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XUD engine#XUD9|XUD9&#8239;TE]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe 306 underwent the only major revamp of its life in May 1997, with the launch of the \"Phase 2\" version (N5 in Australia). The basic shape remained the same, but lights, grille and bumpers were redesigned in an effort to bring the styling into line with the new, more rounded, Peugeot family look established with the [[Peugeot 406]]. Indicator lamps were now incorporated into the headlamp unit and the new style \"block filled\" Peugeot lion logo was adopted. The Phase 2 also saw the addition of an estate version.\n[[File:Peugeot 306 rear 20080822.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 2 Peugeot 306 rear]]\n[[File:Peugeot 306 break darkred hl.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 2 Peugeot 306 break]]\n[[File:2001 Peugeot 306 (N5) convertible (24968645956).jpg|thumb|left|1999\u20132002 Peugeot 306 (N5) cabriolet, Australia]]\n\nA new-style typeface for the car's model number was adopted on the tailgate, removing the black plastic backing. There were also some changes to the dashboard layout, including a digital odometer, and trim quality which freshened up the car in the face of increasingly stiff competition from other manufacturers. New engines were also offered, with both 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines gaining 16-valve cylinder heads together with modest power increases. At this time, the previous trim designations were replaced by L, LX & GLX for the UK market. XS, XSi and GTI-6 models continued as before, but with the Phase 2 headlight, grille, bumper and other cosmetic updates alongside the rest of the range.\n\nCars from 1998 onwards (1999 model year) received further enhancements, including an aluminium-effect centre console on certain versions and a chrome Peugeot logo on the steering wheel. Other updates included removal of the black strip on the bootlid, colour-coded bumpers on some models and new upholstery in the cabin.\n\nNew models also appeared in Phase 2 trim. Sold only in the UK, the Rallye was launched in 1998 using the mechanicals from the GTI-6, but with less standard equipment (manual windows and mirrors, no air-con, Rallye-specific cloth instead of leather and alcantara, front spot lights removed), making it {{convert|65|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter than the GTI-6. Sold at a discounted price of \u00a315,995 (over \u00a32000 less than a GTI-6), it only came in four colours - black, Cherry Red and Bianca White and one only in Dragoon Blue - and there were only 501 produced. The only drawback is the insurance costs as the Rallye is in group 16. As the production of the Rallye straddled the Phase 2 and 3 models, some Rallyes had superficial Phase 3 features such as the flush glass tailgate and slightly different bonnet, but remained fundamentally a Phase 2 model in such characteristics as the fuse box and electrical layout. The UK Rallye is different from the 2001 Australian market N5 Rallye, which was based on the 5-door XT model. In 1998 Peugeot has launched SP version - denotes sport pack, there have 3 different levels of equipment.\n\nThe ''Meridian'' model (originally a special edition) was also relaunched in 1999 and boasted a generous equipment list including new half-leather seats, and further cosmetic upgrades to the interior.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==306 Phase 3==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image          = 2000 Peugeot 306 Meridian 1.6.jpg\n|name           = Phase 3\n| production  = 1999\u20132002\n|engine={{ubl\n  | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]:'''\n  | 1360&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU3|TU3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1587&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA TU engine#TU5|TU5]]'' I4\n  | 1761&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU7|XU7&#8239;JP4]]'' [[Multi-valve|16V]] I4\n  | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10&#8239;J4]]'' 16V I4\n  | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]:'''\n  | 1868&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA EW/DW engine#DW8|DW8A]]'' I4\n  | 1997&nbsp;cc ''[[PSA EW/DW engine#DW10|DW10A]]'' [[common rail]] [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4\n  }}\n}}\n\n[[File:Peugeot 306 3p.jpg|thumb|left|Phase 3 Peugeot 306 3-door]]\n[[File:2000 Peugeot 306 L Estate 1.4 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 Break]]\n[[File:Peugeot 306 (rear left), Denpasar.jpg|thumb|left|Peugeot 306 sedan]]\n\nModels from mid-1999 saw further improvements and exterior modifications, including clear lenses on the headlamps, round and clear lensed foglamps, complete colour-coding of the exterior trim, removal of the black plastic strip on the lower edge of the tailgate, flush glass seal to rear windscreen, a redesigned tailgate rear badge, different rear wiper and new paint colours. Interior upgrades were more minor, with the gearknob becoming rounder and silver topped, while the instrument binnacle received a silver background and white instrument needles in place of the previous red versions.\n\nXSi, XT and D Turbo models all received the GTi-6's bodykit and interior styling additions but not the cyclone alloy wheels. In the diesel variants, the ageing [[PSA XUD|XUD engine]] was replaced by the newer, [[HDi]] engine, which featured common rail injection. Some base models made use of the [[PSA EW/DW engine#DW8|DW8]] normally aspirated diesel engine. Almost all models included [[Anti-lock Braking System|ABS]] and multiple [[airbags]] as standard equipment. Rain sensitive automatic windscreen wipers were also standard on all but the base spec.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==The end of the line==\nDespite Peugeot's efforts, the car placed poorly in a variety of ownership and customer satisfaction surveys of the time, such as the annual [[JD Power]] survey<ref name=\"JDPOWER\">{{cite web|url=http://bbs.scoobynet.com/scoobynet-general-1/9500-jd-power-2001-full-results-table.html|title=2001 JD Power survey of cars registered between August 1998 and August 1999|work=jdpower.com}}</ref> which was run in association with the [[BBC]] ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' television programme. Nevertheless, the car featured in the ''Top 10 Best Selling Cars In Britain'' from 1994 to 1998, and only narrowly missing out on the top 10 during its final three years on sale. Sales in France and most of the rest of Europe were also strong.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn Australia a run-out model was introduced in early 2001.<ref>GoAuto.com.au - Peugeot aims to Rallye sales: Peugeot is offering a special edition 306 at a special price 18 April 2001 By BRUCE NEWTON http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1ED1EA6FB6A56B44CA256A3200292987</ref> Based on the N5 XT 5-door model, it was called the 306 Rallye.

This was one of the highest results achieved in the 2006 ratings.\n\nAustralian Used Car Safety Ratings (UCSR) gave the Peugeot 306 a 4-star rating (out of 5 stars) for driver and occupant safety, and an \"excellent\" rating for other road users involved in accidents.<ref>\"The Peugeot 306 has been awarded a 4 star Driver Protection rating in the latest Used Car Safety Rating(UCSR) report. UCSR are reported annually by the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC). Ratings are estimated from data on real crashes reported to police in Australia and New Zealand and provide a very high level of confidence. The UCSR report classifies cars according to where their rating lies in relation to a best performance benchmark\". http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/2001/Peugeot/306</ref> UCSRs are based on statistics collected from car crashes involving death or serious injury in Australia and New Zealand between 1990 and 2013. Over seven million police reported crashes were analysed in the latest UCSR. Ratings reflect the relative safety of vehicles in preventing severe injury. Driver protection ratings indicate relative safety of vehicles in preventing severe injury to their own drivers, whilst protection for other road user ratings indicate how well the vehicle protects other road users with which they collide.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}http://www.cwn.org.uk/motoring/peugeot/1998/07/980712.htm<nowiki/>{{Commons category|Peugeot 306}}\n\n{{Peugeot}}\n{{Peugeot timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:Peugeot vehicles|306]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP small family cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_306"}
