By creating giant [[Installation art|installations]] that mimic living [[coral reefs]], crocheted out of [[yarn]] and types of [[plastic]], and using algorithms inspired by [[hyperbolic geometry]], the [[project]] resides at the intersection of mathematics, science, [[handicraft]], [[environmentalism]] and community art practice. The project teaches audiences about [[non-Euclidean geometry]], while also engaging them with the subject of [[climate change]] and the decimation of reefs due to [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Barnett (TED) 2017\">{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Rebekah |title=Gallery: What happens when you mix math, coral and crochet?

More than two million people have seen these shows. In the foreword to the ''Crochet Coral Reef'' book, [[Donna Haraway]] calls the project \"palpable, polymorphous, powerful and terrifying [[Sewing|stitchery]]\". Wertheim was invited to speak about the project in a [[TED (conference)|Ted Talk]] in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Margaret Wertheim Figurer |url=https://www.ted.com/speakers/margaret_wertheim |publisher=TED |accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref> The talk has been transcribed into 22 different languages<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wertheim |first1=Margaret |title=The beautiful math of coral |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_wertheim_crochets_the_coral_reef/transcript?language=en |publisher=TED |date=2009}}</ref> and has surpassed 1.3 million views on the Ted website.\n\nSince its beginning in 2005,''Crochet Coral Reef'' has expanded into a [https://crochetcoralreef.org/about/traveling-exhibition/ constellation] of individual reefs including a ''Bleached Reef'', a ''Toxic Reef'' made of video-tape and plastic, a ''Branched Anemone Garden'', and a giant ''Coral Forest'' \u2013 consisting of six large-scale sculptures, three crocheted from yarn and three from plastic.

Professors, librarians, local artists, school students, and hundreds of [[USC]] students all participated in over 3,000 hours of work to complete this object.  Discovered by Dr. Mosely in 2006, the [[Mosely_snowflake|Mosely Snowflake]] is a cousin of the famous ''[[Menger Sponge]]'', the first three-dimensional fractal known to mathematicians which was first described by [[Karl Menger]] in 1926. The ''[https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=mosely+snowflake+sponge&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 Mosely Snowflake Sponge]'' at USC was the first-ever instantiation of this new fractal form, and has since been reproduced by other groups around the world, including in [[Madagascar]]. On display at the University of Southern California's Doheny Memorial Library, the completed ''Mosely Snowflake Sponge'' fractal was constructed out of specially designed business cards colored in the [[Trojans]] pallet of scarlet and gold, and using several geometric designs taken from the [[Oliver Byrne]] version of Euclid's ''Elements''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Mosely Snowflake Fractal |url=https://libraries.usc.edu/about/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/mosely-snowflake-fractal |publisher=USC Libraries |accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n\n* Print Journalism Award (2006) from the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]]<ref name=\"TTU Bio 2017\">{{cite web |title=Margaret Wertheim Brief Bio - 2017 |url=https://www.depts.ttu.edu/stem/seminar/docs/mw-bio.pdf |publisher=TTU |date=2017}}</ref>\n* ''Theo Westenberger Award'' (2011) from the [[Autry Museum]]\n* ''Discovery Fellow'' at the [[University of Southern California]] (2012-2013)<ref name=\"TTU Bio 2017\"/>\n* Vice Chancellor's Fellow at the [[University of Melbourne]] (2015)<ref name=\"TTU Bio 2017\"/>\n* ''AxS Award'' from the Pasadena Arts Council, now know as [https://www.fulcrumarts.org Fulcrum Arts] (2016)\n* [[Klopsteg Memorial Award]] (2016)<ref name=\"AAPT\">{{cite web |title=Klopsteg Memorial Lecture |url=https://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/klopsteg.cfm |publisher=AAPT |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* Scientia Medal (2017)<ref name=\"Street 2017\">{{cite web |last1=Street |first1=Andrew P. |title=Side by side by Wertheim |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/side-by-side-by-wertheim |publisher=Cosmos Magazine |date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n\n; Physics trilogy\n* ''Pythagoras' Trousers: God, Physics, and the Gender Wars'' (1995)\n* ''The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space from Dante to the Internet'' (1999)\n* ''Physics on the Fringe: Smoke Rings, Circlons and Alternative Theories of Everything'' (2011)\n\n; Guides and catalogs\n* ''A Field Guide to Hyperbolic Space'' (2005)\n* ''A Field Guide to the Business Card Menger Sponge'' (2006)\n* ''An Alternative Guide to the Universe: Mavericks, Outsiders, Visionaries''.

Youngest among his four brothers and three sisters, Lt Col Rana had his early education in a Govt School in Rampur, in Hoshiarpur district. He was among the best students of his class and was very popular with his classmates owing to his kind and affectionate nature.\n\n== Military Career ==\nAs Lt Col Rana grew older, his passion for Army also grew. He initially joined the Army in the Corps of Signals and was later  selected for the Army Cadet College, Dehra Dun. After  completing his training, he was commissioned into 3 Bihar on 11 July 1977.

He spotted four well fortified hideouts stocked heavily with arms and ammunition including tonnes of explosives. In a gallant and swift strike, he destroyed these hideouts. One more well concealed hideout came to his notice. During the action that followed, the terrorists resorted to heavy firing from their well fortified bunker. Lt Col Rana organised his troops, crawled towards the bunker and threw hand grenades inside.  Two foreign mercenaries came out firing heavily.

He is the creation of [[R.A. Salvatore]].\n\nWulfgar was originally planned to be the protagonist of Salvatore's first novel series, ''[[The Icewind Dale Trilogy]]'', which was initially to be set in the [[Moonshae Isles]]. As soon as the background was changed to Icewind Dale, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was invented as Wulfgar's sidekick, and succeeded him as the protagonist in following novels.<ref>[http://www.rasalvatore.com/sidemenu/sampleChapters/de.html Introductions by R.A.

Wulfgar is broad-shouldered and thick-chested with a wiry waist, and his arms have been described as thicker than a fat dwarf's thighs. Despite his bulk, he's moderately graceful. He's also relatively young and has a boyish face, and eventually grew a beard.<ref>[http://www.rivkashome.com/lavendereyes/index.php?module=Encyclopedia&func=displayterm&id=17&vid=1 Lavender Eyes -- Encyclopedia - Wulfgar]</ref>\n\nWulfgar has incredible strength for even his barbarian race. For instance, Wulfgar once pulled the prow of an entire ship out of the water, and once lifted a three-hundred-pound man with one arm, and then threw him through the tavern where the bar fight had begun. Also, when he challenged King Heafstaag, a mighty barbarian leader in Icewind Dale, Wulfgar literally crushed the King's head like a melon with his bare hands. Wulfgar managed to resist Heaftaag's spine shattering bear hug as he did so. He also used a large, irritable camel as a projectile weapon to defeat a gang of bandits in ''[[The Halfling's Gem]]'', and escaped a flesh golem, Bok, that was slowly bear-hugging him to death by tearing off its head with his bare hands. Wulfgar would routinely take on foes much bigger than he and defeat them with his strength and mighty warhammer.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nAs a youth, Wulfgar was the flag bearer for Heafstaag, king of the Elk Tribe. He participated in barbarian invasion of [[Sword Coast#Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]], where Bruenor Battlehammer, a [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarf]], knocked Wulfgar out by sweeping his legs out from under him. After the battle, when the people of Ten-towns were slitting throats of the barbarians not quite dead, Bruenor spared Wulfgar. Instead of death, Bruenor sentenced Wulfgar to five years and a day of service to Bruenor. Wulfgar took to the forge and, over time, changed his opinion of Bruenor from a slaver to a father. Bruenor crafted the legendary warhammer [[Aegis-fang]] as a gift for Wulfgar. When Wulfgar's sentence was almost up, Bruenor bade [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], a [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|drow]], to teach Wulfgar how to fight.\n\nWulfgar took up the task of killing the white dragon [[Drizzt Do'Urden's scimitars#Icingdeath|Icingdeath]] (Ingeloakastimizilian) in order to gain credibility, take leadership of his tribe and restore their glory. With the help of Drizzt, Wulfgar challenged and killed the dragon, earning the title Dragonsbane. It was in the Dragon's lair that Drizzt found his scimitar named Icingdeath, with the power to repel flames. The dragon killing scene was criticized by some [[Dungeons & Dragons]] fans for violating the game rules, as both characters were of supposedly low level. Salvatore was quoted replying: ''\"I'll let the poor game designers fret about the proper levels for characters. I just write stories.\"''<ref>[http://www.drow.at/interview.htm R.A. Salvatore chat with fans]</ref>\n\nWith this deed to his credit, he was able to challenge King Heafstaag to combat for leadership of the tribes. Wulfgar defeated Heafstaag, gaining rulership of the ''Tribe of the Elk'', and led the tribes to the aid of the people of Ten-Towns. He also fell in love with Catti-brie, Bruenor's adopted human daughter.\n\nWulfgar followed Bruenor and Drizzt in their campaign for Mithral Hall and struggle against assassin [[Artemis Entreri]]. After Mithral Hall was conquered, Wulfgar resided there. His barbarian attitude, [[chauvinism]] and [[jealousy]] led to rift between Catti-brie, Drizzt, and himself. He also became hostile towards Drizzt and Cattie-brie after being informed by Regis (who was really Artemis Entreri) and the ruby that Cattie-brie was being unfaithful to him with Drizzt. This led to him attacking Drizzt once in Mithral Hall then backing off when he was reminded Drizzt was a friend. Even after Regis was revealed to be Entreri, Wulfgar was still bitter to Cattie-brie leading to a tongue lashing from Bruenor. He and Cattie-brie partially made up after that. When a drow party from Menzoberranzan captured Drizzt, though, Wulfgar followed his friends to rescue. In the battle with a [[yochlol]], Wulfgar caused a ceiling to cave in on himself, and the handmaiden, in order to keep it from killing Cattie-brie. His companions believed he was dead.\n\n=== After resurrection ===\nWulfgar's death received mixed reception and affected some Forgotten Realms fans. It led to debate between author and [[TSR, Inc.]] publishing house. Editors ordered Wulfgar's resurrection in ''[[Passage to Dawn]]'' after the fans' request, despite Salvatore's argument. Later, though, Salvatore was quoted as saying \"I'm really glad I brought Wulfgar back. When I was writing ''Spine of the World'', I came to appreciate making something of what Wulfgar had gone through. When I wrote that book, I sent it to my editor and I said, 'Half the people are going to love this book, and the other half are going to hate it. It is what it is, and there's nothing I can do about it.'\"<ref>[http://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2007/10/dinner-with-drizzt-interview-with-ra.html Fantasy Book Critic: Dinner with Drizzt: An Interview with R.A. Salvatore]</ref>\n\nIn ''Passage to Dawn'', it was explained that yochlol dragged Wulfgar to the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]] and its master [[Lolth]], who later gave Wulfgar to the [[Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon]] Errtu, so that the demon would watch over the drow city Menzoberranzan during the Time of Troubles. When Errtu was summoned by a wizard, he escaped and brought Wulfgar with him. He was tortured and humiliated in the hands of the demon. Drizzt and company defeated Errtu and sent him back to the Abyss, but during his time as Errtu's prisoner Wulfgar's mind was almost broken. He later wound up attacking Cattie-brie during a hallucination, an occurrence which caused him much mental anguish.<ref>[http://www.duskbeforethedawn.net/2008/01/30/bookrev-the-silent-blade-by-ra-salvatore/#more-277 Dusk Before the Dawn: review of \"The Silent Blade\" by R.A. Salvatore]</ref> In an effort to stop the harm he was doing, Wulfgar broke off from the Companions of the Hall, and wandered the North for a time, eventually finding himself at a tavern called the Cutlass, owned by Arumn Gardpeckk.\n\n''[[The Spine of the World]]'' portrays Wulfgar descending into [[alcoholism]]. The barbarian eventually became the bouncer of Arumn's bar and the lover of the barmaid Delly Curtie. Josi Puddles, Arumn's cowardly friend, stole Wulfgar's hammer, fearing that when Arumn decided to fire the huge barbarian, Wulfgar would use the hammer to tear down the bar. Wulfgar was then accused of the attempted murder of Captain Deudermont of the ''Sea Sprite,'' with whom he had sailed several years earlier. He was then taken to the Prisoners Carnival, a vicious show run by the Magistrate Jarkheld, where felons (even ones innocent of the crimes accused of) were tortured in various fashions until they admitted to the crimes accused of, so that they might be killed swiftly. Wulfgar and his friend, Morik the Rogue, who had been accused of the same crime, were pardoned by Captain Deudermont, and took to the road after being banished from the city and refusing to once again sail with the Captain. Wulfgar then for a short time tried to, without alcohol, shut out the memories of his time with Errtu, and the horrible tortures he had suffered with him. After an incident in the small fiefdom of Auckney, involving the young king's wife and a lie concocted to save her illegitimate child, Wulfgar and Morik left with a young child, and Wulfgar was finally able to banish his demons without alcohol, after being shown an act of massive courage by the king's wife when she had nothing to gain from the act. He and Morik then headed back to Luskan for a short time. After apologizing to Arumn for his destructive behavior, and to Delly for not returning her feelings, Wulfgar and Morik parted ways and he left Luskan with Delly and their unnamed child at his side.\n\nIn ''[[Sea of Swords]]'', Wulfgar and Delly then traveled to [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]], where Wulfgar took up with Captain Deudermont and the crew of the Sea Sprite in search of the pirate to whom Josie Puddles had sold his warhammer. After giving up his sea-based search, he travelled into the northlands in search of the pirate Sheila Kree. He eventually met up with his old friends, Drizzt and company, whom he had abandoned months earlier and who had thought him dead.<ref name=sun-times>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4612208.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629113235/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4612208.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 29, 2014 | title=Inside the Best Sellers | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher= Chicago Sun-Times, Inc | date=November 18, 2001 | accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref> With their help (and to a smaller degree Morik's, who had been sleeping with the female wizard of Sheila Kree's crew) he recovered his hammer, Aegis-fang,<ref name=sun-times/> after facing an entire clan of ogres. [[Catti-brie]] then sunk Shelia Kree and her crew with her powerful bow, Taulmaril, as they tried to flee to the sea.\n\nWhen Thibbledorf Pwent and the Gutbuster Brigade arrived, bearing news that Gandalug Battlehammer had died, Wulfgar and his family travelled with his old companions, and the entire clan of Icewind-Dale Battlehammer dwarves, to Mithril Hall so that [[Bruenor Battlehammer|Bruenor]] could resume his reign. Sometime afterward, Bruenor decided to look for another lost dwarven homeland called Gauntlgrym, and the dwarf's closest friends accompanied him, along with five hundred dwarves. On their trek through the Spine of the World, the caravan came upon the ruin of the small human settlement Clicking Heels, which had been sacked by a multitude of Orcs and Frost Giants. Later they picked up the only two survivors of an expedition from [[Citadel Felbarr]], which had been similarly destroyed. Bruenor then determined that himself, Drizzt, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Regis, and a small detachment of dwarves, would see if other villages in the region had also been sacked. Wulfgar assured Delly that he would rejoin her at Mithril Hall after a short time.\n\nDuring their trek, the group entered the small town of Shallows, a small (approximately 120 people and a local wizard) prosperous community. It was during this time, that while out on patrol, one of Shallows militia teams encountered a large force of Orcs and was slaughtered, with only one survivor managing to escape and hide. The lone survivor then sped back to Shallows and told of the Orc force. When the attack began on the town, Wulfgar was charged with holding an entire section of the towns defensive wall, with Regis, Bruenor and his dwarves, the towns militia holding the rest(Drizzt had been unable to get inside the walls before the assault began), while Withegroo the wizard and the towns archers (Catti-Brie among them) firing over the walls from the top of his tower in the center of the town. He performed admirably, holding the wall against the massive force of 1000 Orcs. Repelling grapplers and sweeping aside those few who crested the wall, Wulfgar was unmovable, even after countless hours when exhaustion began to set in. Unfortunately many townspeople still fell during the first assault, due to the 10 Frost Giants who tirelessly hurled boulders against their defenses. When the first assault ended, it left a third of Shallows defenders dead, and many more orcs. Unfortunately, after the last push by Bruenor and his dwarves to clear out the Orcs from in front of Shallows main gates, he fell unconscious, having sustained many blows that would have felled a lesser Dwarf. During this time, Regis left to try to make his way to one of the Dwarven outposts. When the attack began again, the defenders once again managed to hold their fortifications against the invasion. Unfortunately, Bruenor's second in command, Dagnabbit, fell before it even started, when a giant thrown boulder struck Withegroo's tower where he stood shouting commands to his forces, killing him and three other Dwarves. After the second assault was fended off, the towns walls lay in rubble and many more defenders had fallen, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Withegroo and their depleted forces emerged from the rubble and managed to stave off the last attack. After Withegroo cast his last fireball ever and killed many more orcs, Wulfgar stood unmovable against the sea of Orcs that swept against them, and continued to swing his hammer until the press lessened, leaving him and the defenders confused as to why it had stopped. A large wooden idol of Gruumsh One-Eye was then rolled in to the Orc encampment by a caravan of odd Orcs and pack animals. When the idol began to open the orcs crowded around, and were slaughtered by the emerging Gutbusters.. The orcs and pack animals then threw off their druid enchanted cloaks, revealing themselves as Regis, the Bouldershoulder brothers and a small force of Dwarves.\n\nIn ''[[The Two Swords]]'', Delly fell under the powerful will of the sentient sword, Khazid' hea, and was slain by orcs. Townspeople took Colson, without telling Wulfgar. Wulfgar, grieving, is determined to find his adopted daughter.\n\n===Return to Icewind Dale===\nWith the release of ''[[The Orc King]]'', Wulfgar's quest to get his adopted daughter back continues. In the novel, he and Catti-Brie go to Silverymoon, trying to find Cottie, the woman who took Colson, and through Alustriel, they find that she and the girl had gone to [[Nesm\u00e9]], where many refugees have gone to build new homes. After Cottie, who has lost everything dear to her, finally gives up Colson, Wulfgar finally tells Catti-Brie that he will be taking Colson back to her true mother, and that he will return to Icewind Dale, to become anew in his former tribal life. He says that he wants to find a wife and have a family, and that the comforts of Mithral Hall cannot keep his spirit contented. After returning Colson to her true mother in Auckney, Wulfgar returns to the frigid northlands of Icewind Dale, content in his decision.\n\nIn the novel ''[[Gauntlgrym]]'', it is revealed that Wulfgar lived a very long and healthy life, having several children and grandchildren before he finally died. After his death, he was taken to a special heaven created by the goddess Meilikki, and rejoins Regis, Bruenor and Cattie-brie, but declines Meilikki's offer of a rebirth to instead rejoin his ancestors among the presence of Tempus.  It is revealed at the end of ''The Companions'' (the first book of the series ''[[The Sundering (Dungeons and Dragons)|The Sundering]]''), however, that he changed his mind, and rejoins his old companions for the re-creation of the Companions of the Hall.  His story of rebirth and second life is not detailed.\n\n== Aegis-fang ==\n\n''Aegis-fang'' (derived from the mythical shield ''[[Aegis]]'') is the weapon of Wulfgar. It was forged for him by his adoptive father [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] while he was in servitude of the [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarf]] king. It was Bruenor's finest creation. Its head is made from pure [[Mithril]] with a diamond coating magically adhered during the forging and an adamantite shaft. Its head is engraved with the magical inscriptions of [[Clanggedin Silverbeard|Clangeddin]], the dwarven god of battle, as well as the symbols of [[Moradin]], the dwarven god of creation, which covers the symbol of [[Dumathoin]], \"keeper of secrets under the mountain\".\n\nIt is a large and heavy, perfectly balanced ''Dwarven war hammer +5''. When thrown at any giant or giant-class monster, that monster is struck dead (although a powerful [[Frost Giant]] named [[Biggrin]] was able to take the hit, though it gashed the side of his head and dropped the fifteen-foot-tall giant to the floor). Any person not standing over 6'5\" and with considerable strength will have a hard time wielding it properly, though even someone of lesser strength can feel the flawless balance. It is magically attuned to Wulfgar and will reappear in his hand upon command.\n\nWulfgar has been trained extensively by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] with this weapon. He has used it in two battles against dragons, a shadow dragon named  ''[[Shimmergloom]]'' and a white dragon named ''[[Icingdeath]]'', both times ending in victory. He also used it in a battle beside [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and Bruenor Battlehammer against the balor, Errtu, again ending in victory for the companions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{D&D topics}}\n\n[[Category:Forgotten Realms characters]]\n\n[[pl:Lista postaci ze \u015bwiata Forgotten Realms#Wulfgar]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=February 2018}}\n{{all plot|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Wulfgar\n| image              = \n| race               = [[Human]]\n| gender             = Male\n| class              = Barbarian\n| alignment          = Chaotic Good\n| home               = [[Icewind Dale (region)|Icewind Dale]]\n| series             = [[Forgotten Realms]]\n}}\n\n'''Wulfgar''', son of Beornegar, is the [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]] hero of [[Icewind Dale (region)|Icewind Dale]] in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[campaign setting]], and one of the [[Companions of the Hall]] along with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Catti-brie]], Regis the halfling, and [[Bruenor Battlehammer]].

Salvatore]</ref> In an effort to stop the harm he was doing, Wulfgar broke off from the Companions of the Hall, and wandered the North for a time, eventually finding himself at a tavern called the Cutlass, owned by Arumn Gardpeckk.\n\n''[[The Spine of the World]]'' portrays Wulfgar descending into [[alcoholism]]. The barbarian eventually became the bouncer of Arumn's bar and the lover of the barmaid Delly Curtie. Josi Puddles, Arumn's cowardly friend, stole Wulfgar's hammer, fearing that when Arumn decided to fire the huge barbarian, Wulfgar would use the hammer to tear down the bar. Wulfgar was then accused of the attempted murder of Captain Deudermont of the ''Sea Sprite,'' with whom he had sailed several years earlier. He was then taken to the Prisoners Carnival, a vicious show run by the Magistrate Jarkheld, where felons (even ones innocent of the crimes accused of) were tortured in various fashions until they admitted to the crimes accused of, so that they might be killed swiftly. Wulfgar and his friend, Morik the Rogue, who had been accused of the same crime, were pardoned by Captain Deudermont, and took to the road after being banished from the city and refusing to once again sail with the Captain. Wulfgar then for a short time tried to, without alcohol, shut out the memories of his time with Errtu, and the horrible tortures he had suffered with him. After an incident in the small fiefdom of Auckney, involving the young king's wife and a lie concocted to save her illegitimate child, Wulfgar and Morik left with a young child, and Wulfgar was finally able to banish his demons without alcohol, after being shown an act of massive courage by the king's wife when she had nothing to gain from the act. He and Morik then headed back to Luskan for a short time. After apologizing to Arumn for his destructive behavior, and to Delly for not returning her feelings, Wulfgar and Morik parted ways and he left Luskan with Delly and their unnamed child at his side.\n\nIn ''[[Sea of Swords]]'', Wulfgar and Delly then traveled to [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]], where Wulfgar took up with Captain Deudermont and the crew of the Sea Sprite in search of the pirate to whom Josie Puddles had sold his warhammer. After giving up his sea-based search, he travelled into the northlands in search of the pirate Sheila Kree. He eventually met up with his old friends, Drizzt and company, whom he had abandoned months earlier and who had thought him dead.<ref name=sun-times>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4612208.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629113235/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4612208.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 29, 2014 | title=Inside the Best Sellers | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher= Chicago Sun-Times, Inc | date=November 18, 2001 | accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref> With their help (and to a smaller degree Morik's, who had been sleeping with the female wizard of Sheila Kree's crew) he recovered his hammer, Aegis-fang,<ref name=sun-times/> after facing an entire clan of ogres. [[Catti-brie]] then sunk Shelia Kree and her crew with her powerful bow, Taulmaril, as they tried to flee to the sea.\n\nWhen Thibbledorf Pwent and the Gutbuster Brigade arrived, bearing news that Gandalug Battlehammer had died, Wulfgar and his family travelled with his old companions, and the entire clan of Icewind-Dale Battlehammer dwarves, to Mithril Hall so that [[Bruenor Battlehammer|Bruenor]] could resume his reign. Sometime afterward, Bruenor decided to look for another lost dwarven homeland called Gauntlgrym, and the dwarf's closest friends accompanied him, along with five hundred dwarves. On their trek through the Spine of the World, the caravan came upon the ruin of the small human settlement Clicking Heels, which had been sacked by a multitude of Orcs and Frost Giants. Later they picked up the only two survivors of an expedition from [[Citadel Felbarr]], which had been similarly destroyed. Bruenor then determined that himself, Drizzt, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Regis, and a small detachment of dwarves, would see if other villages in the region had also been sacked. Wulfgar assured Delly that he would rejoin her at Mithril Hall after a short time.\n\nDuring their trek, the group entered the small town of Shallows, a small (approximately 120 people and a local wizard) prosperous community. It was during this time, that while out on patrol, one of Shallows militia teams encountered a large force of Orcs and was slaughtered, with only one survivor managing to escape and hide. The lone survivor then sped back to Shallows and told of the Orc force. When the attack began on the town, Wulfgar was charged with holding an entire section of the towns defensive wall, with Regis, Bruenor and his dwarves, the towns militia holding the rest(Drizzt had been unable to get inside the walls before the assault began), while Withegroo the wizard and the towns archers (Catti-Brie among them) firing over the walls from the top of his tower in the center of the town. He performed admirably, holding the wall against the massive force of 1000 Orcs. Repelling grapplers and sweeping aside those few who crested the wall, Wulfgar was unmovable, even after countless hours when exhaustion began to set in. Unfortunately many townspeople still fell during the first assault, due to the 10 Frost Giants who tirelessly hurled boulders against their defenses. When the first assault ended, it left a third of Shallows defenders dead, and many more orcs. Unfortunately, after the last push by Bruenor and his dwarves to clear out the Orcs from in front of Shallows main gates, he fell unconscious, having sustained many blows that would have felled a lesser Dwarf. During this time, Regis left to try to make his way to one of the Dwarven outposts. When the attack began again, the defenders once again managed to hold their fortifications against the invasion. Unfortunately, Bruenor's second in command, Dagnabbit, fell before it even started, when a giant thrown boulder struck Withegroo's tower where he stood shouting commands to his forces, killing him and three other Dwarves. After the second assault was fended off, the towns walls lay in rubble and many more defenders had fallen, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Withegroo and their depleted forces emerged from the rubble and managed to stave off the last attack. After Withegroo cast his last fireball ever and killed many more orcs, Wulfgar stood unmovable against the sea of Orcs that swept against them, and continued to swing his hammer until the press lessened, leaving him and the defenders confused as to why it had stopped. A large wooden idol of Gruumsh One-Eye was then rolled in to the Orc encampment by a caravan of odd Orcs and pack animals. When the idol began to open the orcs crowded around, and were slaughtered by the emerging Gutbusters.. The orcs and pack animals then threw off their druid enchanted cloaks, revealing themselves as Regis, the Bouldershoulder brothers and a small force of Dwarves.\n\nIn ''[[The Two Swords]]'', Delly fell under the powerful will of the sentient sword, Khazid' hea, and was slain by orcs. Townspeople took Colson, without telling Wulfgar. Wulfgar, grieving, is determined to find his adopted daughter.\n\n===Return to Icewind Dale===\nWith the release of ''[[The Orc King]]'', Wulfgar's quest to get his adopted daughter back continues. In the novel, he and Catti-Brie go to Silverymoon, trying to find Cottie, the woman who took Colson, and through Alustriel, they find that she and the girl had gone to [[Nesm\u00e9]], where many refugees have gone to build new homes. After Cottie, who has lost everything dear to her, finally gives up Colson, Wulfgar finally tells Catti-Brie that he will be taking Colson back to her true mother, and that he will return to Icewind Dale, to become anew in his former tribal life. He says that he wants to find a wife and have a family, and that the comforts of Mithral Hall cannot keep his spirit contented. After returning Colson to her true mother in Auckney, Wulfgar returns to the frigid northlands of Icewind Dale, content in his decision.\n\nIn the novel ''[[Gauntlgrym]]'', it is revealed that Wulfgar lived a very long and healthy life, having several children and grandchilden before he finally died. After his death, he was taken to a special heaven created by the goddess Meilikki, and rejoins Regis, Bruenor and Cattie-brie, but declines Meilikki's offer of a rebirth to instead rejoin his ancestors among the presence of Tempus.  It is revealed at the end of ''The Companions'' (the first book of the series ''[[The Sundering (Dungeons and Dragons)|The Sundering]]''), however, that he changed his mind, and rejoins his old companions for the re-creation of the Companions of the Hall.  His story of rebirth and second life is not detailed.\n\n== Aegis-fang ==\n\n''Aegis-fang'' (derived from the mythical shield ''[[Aegis]]'') is the weapon of Wulfgar. It was forged for him by his adoptive father [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] while he was in servitude of the [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarf]] king. It was Bruenor's finest creation. Its head is made from pure [[Mithril]] with a diamond coating magically adhered during the forging and an adamantite shaft. Its head is engraved with the magical inscriptions of [[Clanggedin Silverbeard|Clangeddin]], the dwarven god of battle, as well as the symbols of [[Moradin]], the dwarven god of creation, which covers the symbol of [[Dumathoin]], \"keeper of secrets under the mountain\".\n\nIt is a large and heavy, perfectly balanced ''Dwarven war hammer +5''. When thrown at any giant or giant-class monster, that monster is struck dead (although a powerful [[Frost Giant]] named [[Biggrin]] was able to take the hit, though it gashed the side of his head and dropped the fifteen-foot-tall giant to the floor). Any person not standing over 6'5\" and with considerable strength will have a hard time wielding it properly, though even someone of lesser strength can feel the flawless balance. It is magically attuned to Wulfgar and will reappear in his hand upon command.\n\nWulfgar has been trained extensively by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] with this weapon. He has used it in two battles against dragons, a shadow dragon named  ''[[Shimmergloom]]'' and a white dragon named ''[[Icingdeath]]'', both times ending in victory. He also used it in a battle beside [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and Bruenor Battlehammer against the balor, Errtu, again ending in victory for the companions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{D&D topics}}\n\n[[Category:Forgotten Realms characters]]\n\n[[pl:Lista postaci ze \u015bwiata Forgotten Realms#Wulfgar]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReturn to Icewind Dale", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfgar_(Forgotten_Realms)"}

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [https://www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T.

Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. His currently serving police executive students include   Stephen Williams, Acting Commissioner of Police, [[Trinidad and Tobago Police Service]]; from the UK, Chief Constables [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]] ([[Thames Valley Police]]), Simon Bailey ([[Norfolk Constabulary]]), John Parkinson ([[West Yorkshire Police]]), and Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale ([[West Midlands Police]]); and Police Chief William Farrar, from the [[Rialto Police Department]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\nSherman has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his work in the field of criminology and policing. Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology. In 2011, the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him its [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)]] for his work on evidence-based crime prevention, and in 2009 he won the Beccaria Gold Medal of the Criminology Society of German-Speaking Countries.  \n \nIn 2013 the [[Stockholm University|University of Stockholm]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in social science, and [[George Mason University]] presented him its Award for Distinguished Achievement in Evidence-Based Crime Policy. In 2014 [[Denison University]] awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.\n\nIn 1998 he was elected the Founding President of the Academy of Experimental Criminology<ref>\"AEC Presidents: Lawrence W.

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [[Www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk|Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.</ref> this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. His currently serving police executive students include   Stephen Williams, Acting Commissioner of Police, [[Trinidad and Tobago Police Service]]; from the UK, Chief Constables [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]] ([[Thames Valley Police]]), Simon Bailey ([[Norfolk Constabulary]]), John Parkinson ([[West Yorkshire Police]]), and Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale ([[West Midlands Police]]); and Police Chief William Farrar, from the [[Rialto Police Department]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\nSherman has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his work in the field of criminology and policing. Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology. In 2011, the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him its [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)]] for his work on evidence-based crime prevention, and in 2009 he won the Beccaria Gold Medal of the Criminology Society of German-Speaking Countries.  \n \nIn 2013 the [[Stockholm University|University of Stockholm]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in social science, and [[George Mason University]] presented him its Award for Distinguished Achievement in Evidence-Based Crime Policy.

It is covered by R&B vocalists [[Kelly Price]] as Aunt Sarah, [[Marsha Ambrosius]] as Safronia, [[Jill Scott]] as Sweet Thing, and [[Ledisi]] as Peaches.\n\nThe song inspired the 2016 play ''Nina Simone: Four Women'' by Christina Ham. In the play, Nina meets the first three women (she is the fourth) at the site of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], and they become the characters in her song.\n\nThe song is sampled in the 2017 song \"[[The Story of O.J.]]\" from rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s thirteenth album ''[[4:44 (album)|4:44]]'', mixing many of the lyrics to create a background track.

They believed it drew on black stereotypes, and it was subsequently banned on several major radio stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nina Simone Returns ... 25 Years Later&#124;|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=13 April 1993|quote=banned by some radio stations}}</ref><ref name=\"Virgin Islands Daily News radio station controversy\">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=George F.|title=San Juan Entertainment|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=grdNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wUQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3795,2693076&dq=four-women+nina-simone+ban+radio&hl=en|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[The Virgin Islands Daily News]]|date=14 December 1966|page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Cover versions and uses in popular culture==\n{{unref-section|date=July 2017}}\nThe English blues rock band [[Black Cat Bones]] covered the song on their only album, ''[[Barbed Wire Sandwich]]'', released in 1969.\n\nThe song was adapted by filmmaker [[Julie Dash]] into a 1978 [[Four Women (1978 film)|short experimental film of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/la-rebellion/films/four-women|title=Four Women|publisher=UCLA Film and Television Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[Sandra Bernhard]] performs the song in her one woman show, filmed in 1990 by [[John Boskovich]] and released as the film [[Without You I'm Nothing (film)|''Without You I'm Nothing'']].\n\nThe group [[Reflection Eternal]] which is made up of rapper [[Talib Kweli]] and producer [[Hi-Tek]] has a version titled \"For Women\" on their 2000 debut album ''[[Train of Thought (Reflection Eternal album)|Train of Thought]]''.\n\nBerlin soul singer [[Joy Denalane]], featuring Sara Tavares, Chiwoniso & Deborah, interpreted the song on her 2002 debut album ''[[Mamani (album)|Mamani]]''.\n\nA cover version of this song was featured in the ending credits of the 2010 movie ''[[For Colored Girls]]'', featuring a sample of Nina Simone singing the 1st verse (as Aunt Sarah) with newly re-recorded vocals performed by Nina's daughter, [[Simone (actress)|Lisa Simone]], singing Safronia's verse, [[Laura Izibor]] singing the role of Sweet Thing, and [[Ledisi]] singing Peaches' verse.\n\nThe song was also on the 2010 show ''[[Black Girls Rock!]]''. It is covered by R&B vocalists [[Kelly Price]] as Aunt Sarah, [[Marsha Ambrosius]] as Safronia, [[Jill Scott]] as Sweet Thing, and [[Ledisi]] as Peaches.\n\nThe song inspired the 2016 play ''Nina Simone: Four Women'' by Christina Ham. In the play, Nina meets the first three women (she is the fourth) at the site of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], and they become the characters in her song.\n\nThe song is sampled in the 2017 song [[The Story of O.J.]] from rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s thirteenth album [[4:44 (album)|4:44]], mixing many of the lyrics to create a background track. The song visits similar themes of injustice and suffering of African-American people in modern America.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nina Simone}}\n\n[[Category:Nina Simone songs]]\n[[Category:1966 songs]]\n[[Category:American jazz songs]]\n[[Category:Obscenity controversies in music]]\n[[Category:Songs with feminist themes]]\n[[Category:Songs against racism and xenophobia]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Nina Simone]]\n", "name_user": "Graham87", "label": "safe", "comment": "put back quotes and italics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Women_(song)"}
