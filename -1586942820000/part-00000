Carlisle represented his home county of [[Lancashire County Football Association|Lancashire]] at youth level. The start of his professional career was his [[English Football League|Football League]] debut for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in September 1997. He moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 national team]]. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]] because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers at the end of that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].\n\nCarlisle spent just one season with Leeds United before signing for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in August 2005. In the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306 season]], his first with Watford, the team finished third in the division and achieved [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League via the [[2006 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-offs]]. However, a thigh injury caused Carlisle to miss the majority of the team's season in the top flight. In March 2007 he had a one-month loan spell at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. In August 2007, [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Steve Cotterill]] bought Carlisle from Watford for a transfer fee of \u00a3200,000. In the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he played over 40 matches as Burnley reached the semi-finals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and finished fifth in the league, earning a place in the play-offs. Carlisle was named [[man of the match]] for his performance in the [[2009 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off final]] as Burnley beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1\u20130 to return to the top tier of English football for the first time in 33 years.\n\nAn imposing figure in the centre of defence thanks to his stature, Carlisle also provided an attacking threat from set pieces.\n\nHe is a practising [[Christianity|Christian]] and regularly attends church. He attended [[Balshaw's Church of England High School]] where he attained 10 A-grades at [[GCSE]] and studied mathematics and politics at [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]], and in 2002 was awarded the title of \"Britain's Brainiest Footballer\" in a TV game show. He has been an ambassador for the [[Kick It Out (organisation)|Kick It Out]] campaign and is a former Chairman of the Management Committee of the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]. Carlisle has suffered from recurring problems with alcohol and depression.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCarlisle was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]].<ref name=\"Hugman2010/11\"/> He grew up in the city with his parents, Mervin and Rose (n\u00e9e Edgar).<ref name=\"indClarkeCarlisle\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd%2fb%2f1979%2f4%2faz%2f000225%2f110 |url-access=subscription  |via=Findmypast |title=England & Wales births 1837\u20132008 Transcription |at=Clarke James Carlisle.

He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]] because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers at the end of that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].\n\nCarlisle spent just one season with Leeds United before signing for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in August 2005. In the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306 season]], his first with Watford, the team finished third in the division and achieved [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League via the [[2006 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-offs]]. However, a thigh injury caused Carlisle to miss the majority of the team's season in the top flight. In March 2007 he had a one-month loan spell at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. In August 2007, [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Steve Cotterill]] bought Carlisle from Watford for a transfer fee of \u00a3200,000. In the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he played over 40 matches as Burnley reached the semi-finals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and finished fifth in the league, earning a place in the play-offs. Carlisle was named [[man of the match]] for his performance in the [[2009 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off final]] as Burnley beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1\u20130 to return to the top tier of English football for the first time in 33 years.\n\nAn imposing figure in the centre of defence thanks to his stature, Carlisle also provided an attacking threat from set pieces.\n\nHe is a practising [[Christianity|Christian]] and regularly attends church. He attended [[Balshaw's Church of England High School]] where he attained 10 A-grades at [[GCSE]] and studied mathematics and politics at [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]], and in 2002 was awarded the title of \"Britain's Brainiest Footballer\" in a TV game show.

By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and in January 1854, in Victoria, was the engineer on the [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]1,000,000 prospectus for the [[Geelong\u2013Ballarat railway line]].  He was also listed as the surveyor for the Colonial Insurance Company, and there are a number of tender advertisements, for reinstatement for damaged buildings. In 1855, he presented a well received paper on the merits of iron truss bridges to the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science (later the [[Royal Society of Victoria]]). Other works he designed included {{convert|17|mi|km|0|order=flip}} of the railway line from {{NSWcity|Newcastle}} to {{NSWcity|Maitland}}, prior to 1858, the design and construction of the [[Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company|Melbourne and Essendon Railway]] in 1859, and works for the Yarra Yarra Mining Company,<ref>Yarra Yarra Mining Company prospectus</ref> and Sandridge Lagoon, Port Melbourne.\n\nBell was responsible for a number of fairly similar wrought iron lattice truss road and rail bridges, several of which were fabricated from components supplied by Messrs. Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks, Staffordshire. The West Maitland Bridge was the sixth bridge this firm exported for Bell, with the others including the [[Hawthorn Railway Bridge]] and [[Hawthorn Bridge|Hawthorn Road Bridge]] over the River Yarra, in Melbourne, the [[Prince Alfred Bridge]] at [[Gundagai]], and the Pitnacree and [[Dunmore Bridge|Dunmore]] bridges in New South Wales.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13177442 |title=To the Editor of the Herald. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 December 1868 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nHis expertise was sought for a number of Melbourne civic works projects as he gave evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust in 1858 and 1860, and to the Select Committees on the Railway Department in 1860 and on the Central Railway Terminus in 1861 and in the same year was a member of the Royal Society of Victoria's Sanitary Committee.

As [[elevation]] increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation.

On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square [[centimetre]] (cm<sup>2</sup>), measured from mean (average) [[sea level]] to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a [[mass]] of about 1.03 [[kilogram]] and exerts a [[force]] or \"weight\" of about 10.1 [[newtons]], resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm<sup>2</sup> or 101{{nbsp}}[[newton (unit)#Commonly seen as kilonewtons|kN]]/m<sup>2</sup> (101 kilopascals, kPa).

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [[Internet]]. When [[barometer]]s in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe ''[[altimeter setting]]'' in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.\n\nAverage ''sea-level pressure'' is {{convert|1013.25|mbar|kPa inHg mmHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. In aviation, weather reports ([[METAR]]), [[QNH]] is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar), except in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Colombia]] where it is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report ''sea-level pressure'' SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.<ref>[http://www.flightplanning.navcanada.ca/cgi-bin/Fore-obs/metar.cgi?NoSession=NS_Inconnu&format=dcd&Langue=anglais&Region=can&Stations=CYVR&Location= Sample METAR of CYVR] Nav Canada</ref> However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/weather/s0000635.html |title=Montreal Current Weather |publisher=CBC Montreal, Canada |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: {{convert|1013.2|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}}  is transmitted as 132; {{convert|1000.0|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}} is transmitted as 000; 998.7{{nbsp}}mbar is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on [[Earth]] occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above {{convert|1050|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}, with record highs close to {{convert|1085|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. The lowest measurable ''sea-level pressure'' is found at the centers of [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es, with a [[Atmospheric pressure#Records|record low]] of {{convert|870|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}.\n\n== Surface pressure {{anchor|Surface}} ==\n{{redirect|Surface pressure|surface pressure in physical chemistry|Pressure#Surface pressure and surface tension}}\n\n''Surface pressure'' is the atmospheric pressure at a location on [[Earth]]'s surface ([[terrain]] and [[oceans]]).  It is directly proportional to the [[mass]] of air over that location.\n\nFor numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [[general circulation model]]s (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional ''[[logarithm]] of surface pressure''.\n\nThe average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa.<ref name=\"jacobs\">Jacob, Daniel J.

Princeton University Press, 1999.</ref> This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level. The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (Atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury.\n\nPressure (P), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.\n\n== Altitude variation ==\n{{further|Barometric formula|Vertical pressure variation}}\n[[File:Storm over Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull.jpg|thumb|left|A very local storm above [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], showing clouds formed on the mountain by [[orographic lift]]]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Pressure vs. Altitude.png|thumb|300px|Variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude, computed for 15&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0% relative humidity.]]\n[[File:Plastic bottle at 14000 feet, 9000 feet and 1000 feet, sealed at 14000 feet.png|thumb|This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately {{convert|14000|ft|m}} altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure, recorded at {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, as it was brought down towards sea level.]]\n\nPressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface; so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the [[mesosphere]]. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.<ref>[http://archive.psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf A quick derivation relating altitude to air pressure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928003908/http://psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} by Portland State Aerospace Society, 2004, accessed 05032011</ref> Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure.

Thus, a diver 10.3&nbsp;m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1&nbsp;atm of air plus 1&nbsp;atm of water). Conversely, 10.3&nbsp;m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using [[suction]] under standard atmospheric conditions.\n\nLow pressures such as [[natural gas]] lines are sometimes specified in [[inch of water|inches of water]], typically written as ''w.c.''

On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square [[centimetre]] (cm<sup>2</sup>), measured from mean (average) [[sea level]] to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a [[mass]] of about 1.03 [[kilogram]] and exerts a [[force]] or \"weight\" of about 10.1 [[newtons]], resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm<sup>2</sup> or 101{{nbsp}}[[newton (unit)#Commonly seen as kilonewtons|kN]]/m<sup>2</sup> (101 kilopascals, kPa). A column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1{{nbsp}}in<sup>2</sup> would have a weight of about 14.7{{nbsp}}lb<sub>f</sub>, resulting in a pressure of 14.7{{nbsp}}lb<sub>f</sub>/in<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==Mechanism==\n<!--what causes atmospheric pressure-->\nAtmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface, and is a function of the mass of the planet, the radius of the surface, and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=atmospheric pressure (encyclopedic entry)|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/atmospheric-pressure/|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Q & A: Pressure - Gravity Matters?|url=https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=2232|website=Department of Physics|publisher=University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity, density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14whM9fEOzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=atmospheric+pressure+density+temperature+and+composition&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB3o2Ar7jlAhXIrFkKHbJeCo4Q6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=atmospheric%20pressure%20density%20temperature%20and%20composition&f=false|title=Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry|last=Jacob|first=Daniel J.|date=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691001852|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Mean sea-level pressure ==\n[[File:Day5pressureforecast.png|thumb|left|Map showing atmospheric pressure in mbar or hPa]]\n[[File:Mslp-jja-djf.png|thumb|15-year average mean sea-level pressure for June, July, and August (top) and December, January, and February (bottom).

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [[Internet]]. When [[barometer]]s in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe ''[[altimeter setting]]'' in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.\n\nAverage ''sea-level pressure'' is {{convert|1013.25|mbar|kPa inHg mmHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. In aviation, weather reports ([[METAR]]), [[QNH]] is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar), except in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Colombia]] where it is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report ''sea-level pressure'' SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.<ref>[http://www.flightplanning.navcanada.ca/cgi-bin/Fore-obs/metar.cgi?NoSession=NS_Inconnu&format=dcd&Langue=anglais&Region=can&Stations=CYVR&Location= Sample METAR of CYVR] Nav Canada</ref> However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/weather/s0000635.html |title=Montreal Current Weather |publisher=CBC Montreal, Canada |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: {{convert|1013.2|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}}  is transmitted as 132; {{convert|1000.0|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}} is transmitted as 000; 998.7{{nbsp}}mbar is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on [[Earth]] occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above {{convert|1050|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}, with record highs close to {{convert|1085|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}.

It is directly proportional to the [[mass]] of air over that location.\n\nFor numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [[general circulation model]]s (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional ''[[logarithm]] of surface pressure''.\n\nThe average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa.<ref name=\"jacobs\">Jacob, Daniel J.

Princeton University Press, 1999.</ref> This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level. The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (Atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. \n\nPressure (P), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.\n\n== Altitude variation ==\n{{further|Barometric formula|Vertical pressure variation}}\n[[File:Storm over Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull.jpg|thumb|left|A very local storm above [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], showing clouds formed on the mountain by [[orographic lift]]]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Pressure vs. Altitude.png|thumb|300px|Variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude, computed for 15&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0% relative humidity.]]\n[[File:Plastic bottle at 14000 feet, 9000 feet and 1000 feet, sealed at 14000 feet.png|thumb|This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately {{convert|14000|ft|m}} altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure, recorded at {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, as it was brought down towards sea level.]]\n\nPressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface; so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the [[mesosphere]]. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.<ref>[http://archive.psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf A quick derivation relating altitude to air pressure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928003908/http://psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} by Portland State Aerospace Society, 2004, accessed 05032011</ref> Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure.
