The program was located at the campus of [[Dominion High School]] at 21326 Augusta Drive in [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]], an area in unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]. During the summer of 2018, the Academy of Science became a division of the [[Academies of Loudoun]], located at 42075 Academy Drive in Leesburg, VA.  The Academies of Loudoun include the Academy of Engineering & Technology, The Academy of Science, and Monroe Advanced Technical Academy.\n\n==History and structure==\nThe Academy of Science program was established in 2005 as a magnet program of science and technology for Loudoun County students. \nThe purpose of the Academy is to provide advanced academic math and science courses for students interested in STEM.  These courses include [[Advanced Placement]] courses, as well as classes devoted purely towards scientific research.\n\n==Admissions==\nThe admissions process is extraordinarily competitive for 8th graders who wish to attend the Academies of Loudoun. As the AOS science, math, and research curriculum has gained popularity over the years, the number of applicants has soared. Prior to 2018, 68 students would enroll each year which resulted in an acceptance rate of approximately 7%, making admission highly competitive. Once the Academy became part of the Academies of Loudoun building, additional classroom space and teaching faculty allowed 120 9th graders to enroll each year.\n\n==Extracurricular activities and athletics==\nAll students who attend the Academies of Loudoun every other school day where they take courses in math, science, and research. On alternating days, Academy students attend their home school, where they take courses in English, Social Studies, and other electives.  The Loudoun County High Schools try to coordinate their schedules to allow Academy students to take extra curricular classes at the home school, but scheduling conflicts often arise.  Students who attend the Academies of Loudoun are concurrently enrolled in both their home school and the Academies of Loudoun.\n\nAcademy students who are on athletic teams play for their home schools and their respective conferences.\n\n==Research==\nMost of the Academy of Science curriculum is based on a junior/senior year research project. After a topic is chosen and approved, students work with a large spectrum of different lab devices and their mentor to further develop this research project. Students also are given the option to apply for a collaboration project with students of Hwa Chong Institution in Singapore, or Daegu Science High School in South Korea. Participants in this program are then presented the opportunity to travel to Singapore/Korea for a research competition. \n\nIn past years, students have developed numerous research projects that have been exceptionally successful\u2014some of these had research papers were published, while others went on to place in many large science competitions such as the Siemens Westinghouse Science and Technology Competition, the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, and the [[Intel ISEF]] competition.\n\n==Expansion==\nThe Academy of Science was originally at [[Dominion High School]] in [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]]. In the summer of 2018, the program became part of the [[Academies of Loudoun]] at 42075 Loudoun Academy Drive, [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].

The program was located at the campus of [[Dominion High School]] at 21326 Augusta Drive in [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]], an area in unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]. During the summer of 2018, the Academy of Science became a division of the [[Academies of Loudoun]], located at 42075 Academy Drive in Leesburg, VA.  The Academies of Loudoun include the Academy of Engineering & Technology, The Academy of Science, and Monroe Advanced Technical Academy.\n\n==History and structure==\nThe Academy of Science program was established in 2005 as a magnet program of science and technology for Loudoun County students. \nThe purpose of the Academy is to provide advanced academic math and science courses for students interested in STEM.  These courses include [[Advanced Placement]] courses, as well as classes devoted purely towards scientific research.\n\n==Admissions==\nThe admissions process is extraordinarily competitive for 8th graders who wish to attend the Academies of Loudoun. As the AOS science, math, and research curriculum has gained popularity over the years, the number of applicants has soared. Prior to 2018, 68 students would enroll each year which resulted in an acceptance rate of approximately 7%, making admission highly competitive. Once the Academy became part of the Academies of Loudoun building, additional classroom space and teaching faculty allowed 120 9th graders to enroll each year.\n\n==Extracurricular activities and athletics==\nAll students who attend the Academies of Loudoun every other school day where they take courses in math, science, and research. On alternating days, Academy students attend their home school, where they take courses in English, Social Studies, and other electives.  The Loudoun County High Schools try to coordinate their schedules to allow Academy students to take extra curricular classes at the home school, but scheduling conflicts often arise.  Students who attend the Academies of Loudoun are concurrently enrolled in both their home school and the Academies of Loudoun.\n\nAcademy students who are on athletic teams play for their home schools and their respective conferences.\n\n==Research==\nMost of the Academy of Science curriculum is based on a junior/senior year research project. After a topic is chosen and approved, students work with a large spectrum of different lab devices and their mentor to further develop this research project. Students also are given the option to apply for a collaboration project with students of Hwa Chong Institution in Singapore, or Daegu Science High School in South Korea. Participants in this program are then presented the opportunity to travel to Singapore/Korea for a research competition. \n\nIn past years, students have developed numerous research projects that have been exceptionally successful\u2014some of these had research papers were published, while others went on to place in many large science competitions such as the Siemens Westinghouse Science and Technology Competition, the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, and the [[Intel ISEF]] competition.\n\n==Expansion==\nThe Academy of Science was originally at [[Dominion High School]] in [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]].

While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]].

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]].
