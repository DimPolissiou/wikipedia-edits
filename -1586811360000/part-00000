Martha died in 1778 while giving birth to the third son. Life on the frontier was tumultuous, and the Indians' continual raiding led to a reprisal by the Virginia's Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore. In 1774 Posey was in the quartermaster's department of an armed expedition against the Indians who were threatening the frontier settlements.<ref>Sparks, p. 365</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]], and the expedition succeeded in suppressing the Indians for the short term.<ref name = g34>Gugin, p. 34</ref>\n\n===Revolutionary War===\nPosey was elected a member of the [[Virginia]] [[committee of correspondence]] in 1775.<ref>Sparks, p. 372</ref> He served in the army during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], first as a captain in the [[Continental Army]], mostly with the [[7th Virginia Regiment]], then later rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1782. Some claimed his quick rise was due to the patronage of [[George Washington]]. During the war Posey led campaigns against Lord Dunmore who was fortified on Gwyn's Island and drove him and his naval support out of the area. Lord Dunmore had been the officer he served under during the Indian war. In the winter of 1775 the 7th Virginia Regiment marched to join with General [[George Washington]] in [[New Jersey]]. It was at this time that Washington promoted Posey to the rank of Captain.<ref>Sparks, p. 376</ref> During the winter of 1776, Posey commanded the pickets guarding the [[Valley Forge]] encampment and led skirmishes almost daily. The following campaigning season, his corps was involved in the battle to drive Gen. Howe back to [[New York City]], and played a critical role in the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. In 1778 Capt. Posey replaced [[Daniel Morgan]] as commander of the [[Provisional Rifle Corps]] when it was reduced to two companies. His small unit was sent to upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to help secure that frontier flank of the Continental Army's Highland Department.<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 378</ref> He was promoted to major and given command of the [[7th Virginia Regiment]] on December 20, 1778.\n\nIn July 1779 Posey was assigned to command a battalion of light infantry in Corps of Light Infantry commanded by Brig-Gen. [[Anthony Wayne]]. As part of the provisional 1st Regiment under Col. [[Christian Febiger]], he led his battalion in a bayonet night assault to [[Battle of Stony Point|storm Stony Point]], a key British position on the [[Hudson River]] near West Point. Posey was one of the first to enter the British works and seized the colors of the [[17th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 380</ref>\n\nIn his absence, the 7th Virginia regiment was ordered on December 8, 1779, to join the rest of the Virginia Line to march to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to join the Southern Army. When the Corps of Light Infantry disbanded in December, Posey was sent to join his regiment, but the army surrendered on May 12, 1780, before he could rejoin it. As one of the few uncaptured Virginia officers, Posey had few duties until exchange of captured soldiers occurred in early 1781, at which time Col. Febiger recruited him to help reconstitute the Virginia Line in a new \"18-month\" battalion. He became de facto commander of the battalion and served in the [[siege of Yorktown]]. During 1781\u20131782 he served with General Wayne again, this time in Georgia against the forces in Savannah. He was promoted to Lt. Col. in 1782.<ref>Sparks, p. 381</ref><ref name = g35>Gugin, p. 35</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, Posey returned to Virginia having resigned from the army on March 10, 1783.  In the same year he became an original member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]].\n\nHe took guardianship of his surviving son who had been living with friends since the death of his mother. Posey married Mary Alexander Thornton, the wealthy widow of George Thornton, in 1784. Posey had nine children by her. He remained married to her until his death. The family lived on her [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] plantation, where Posey farmed for nearly eighteen years. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1797, and held several appointed position in the Virginia state government.<ref name = g35/>\n\nPosey briefly returned to the military following several setbacks to the army which was campaigning against the [[Wabash Confederacy]] in the [[Old Northwest]]. He reentered the army as a [[brigadier general]] in 1793 and served with \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] campaigning against the Indians beyond the frontier in the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>Sparks, p. 392</ref> Posey was disturbed by the actions of second in command, General [[James Wilkinson]]. Wilkinson had been secretly undermining Wayne's authority in reports to Washington, and Posey discovered that Wilkinson had been involved in similar plots against other ranking officers, including the former frontier commander [[George Rogers Clark]]. Years after Wilkinson's death, it was discovered that he had been accepting bribery money from [[Spain]] to stir up trouble on the frontier. Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Public office==\n\n===Kentucky and Louisiana===\n\nIn 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>\n\nIn preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812\u20131813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destr\u00e9han]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>\n\n===Indiana Territory===\n\nAfter he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>\n\nPosey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>\n\nPosey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>\n\nDespite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nIn the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref>. were named in honor of Thomas Posey.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=308lAAAAMAAJ|title=Pioneer History of Indiana, |author=Cockrum, William Monroe | year=1907 | publisher=Press of Oakland City journal}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBsNAAAAIAAJ|title= The Library of American Biograph|author=Sparks, Jared | year=1846 | publisher=Hilliard, Gray and co.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|year=1975|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-06896-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC}}\n\n;Further reading\n*Cecere, Michael.

Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Public office==\n\n===Kentucky and Louisiana===\n\nIn 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>\n\nIn preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812\u20131813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destr\u00e9han]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>\n\n===Indiana Territory===\n\nAfter he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>\n\nPosey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>\n\nPosey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>\n\nDespite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nIn the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref>. were named in honor of Thomas Posey.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=308lAAAAMAAJ|title=Pioneer History of Indiana, |author=Cockrum, William Monroe | year=1907 | publisher=Press of Oakland City journal}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBsNAAAAIAAJ|title= The Library of American Biograph|author=Sparks, Jared | year=1846 | publisher=Hilliard, Gray and co.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|year=1975|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-06896-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC}}\n\n;Further reading\n*Cecere, Michael.

By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.\n\n== Background ==\nThe county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>Tringham, General History.</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>\n\n== Early-war Burton ==\nBurton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>Tringham, Established Church.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Gell.jpg|thumb|left|Sir John Gell]]\nEast Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>\n\nParliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nDuring this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]\nGell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>\n\nIn July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>\n\nThe Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]\nHaving lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>\n\nThe new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>\n\nA Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria. For this exploit of signal valour, Thomas Tyldesley was subsequently knighted by King Charles I.

the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>\n\nParliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nDuring this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]\nGell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>\n\nIn July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>\n\nThe Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]\nHaving lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>\n\nThe new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>\n\nA Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria.
