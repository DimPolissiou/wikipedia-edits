The band has also managed to sell out two consecutive nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London. Sarah Taylor said on Varsity \"In general, this album pushes more boundaries than the last one. The band carved a name for themselves with their debut, but here it feels like they\u2019re trying to define themselves to a further extent; there\u2019s more variety in the music and lyricism, and more politics, too. Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and lyricist alongside Mason, said that \u201call the songs on the album are things that we\u2019ve gone through or spoken about: Trump, religion, bigotry...\u201d and \u2018Live Like Animals\u2019 is an anthem for the disillusioned youth. It features lyrics such as \u201cWe put our lives all up for sale / We get our truth in the daily mail\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make \u2019em build a wall / We\u2019re gonna live like animals\u201d. Other tracks, such as \u2018Broken Machine\u2019 itself, and the deluxe version\u2019s \u2018Number 13\u2019 are more experimental rhythmically: they\u2019re the type of songs you have to listen to a few times before you decide whether you like them or not. I did, and I do.\"\n<ref>https://www.varsity.co.uk/music/13464</ref>.\n\nOn 24 August 2018, the band debuted a new song live entitled \"Forever and Ever More\" at Reading Festival, which was released as the lead off single from their new EP, \"[[What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?]]\" a few days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nothing-but-thieves/2018/little-johns-farm-reading-england-2be8c43e.html|title=Nothing But Thieves Reading 2018 Setlist|work=Setlist|accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> The EP was released on 19 October 2018 alongside the second single from, \"Take This Lonely Heart\", on the same day.\n\n=== 2020: Upcoming third studio album ===\nOn 18 March 2020, the first single of an upcoming third studio album was released, named \"Is Everybody Going Crazy?\".\n\nOn 11 April 2020, the band denied accusations of sexual assault against numerous members.

The band has also managed to sell out two consecutive nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London. Sarah Taylor said on Varsity \"In general, this album pushes more boundaries than the last one. The band carved a name for themselves with their debut, but here it feels like they\u2019re trying to define themselves to a further extent; there\u2019s more variety in the music and lyricism, and more politics, too. Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and lyricist alongside Mason, said that \u201call the songs on the album are things that we\u2019ve gone through or spoken about: Trump, religion, bigotry...\u201d and \u2018Live Like Animals\u2019 is an anthem for the disillusioned youth. It features lyrics such as \u201cWe put our lives all up for sale / We get our truth in the daily mail\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make \u2019em build a wall / We\u2019re gonna live like animals\u201d. Other tracks, such as \u2018Broken Machine\u2019 itself, and the deluxe version\u2019s \u2018Number 13\u2019 are more experimental rhythmically: they\u2019re the type of songs you have to listen to a few times before you decide whether you like them or not. I did, and I do.\"\n<ref>https://www.varsity.co.uk/music/13464</ref>.\n\nOn 24 August 2018, the band debuted a new song live entitled \"Forever and Ever More\" at Reading Festival, which was released as the lead off single from their new EP, \"[[What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?]]\" a few days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nothing-but-thieves/2018/little-johns-farm-reading-england-2be8c43e.html|title=Nothing But Thieves Reading 2018 Setlist|work=Setlist|accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> The EP was released on 19 October 2018 alongside the second single from, \"Take This Lonely Heart\", on the same day.\n\n=== 2020: Upcoming third studio album ===\nOn 18 March 2020, the first single of an upcoming third studio album was released, named \"Is Everybody Going Crazy?\".\n\nOn 11 April 2020, the band denied accusations of sexual assault against numerous members.

He dedicated in his own Lateran Palace a Church to the Saviour, and built hard by it a Cathedral in the name of St. John the Baptist, upon the place where he had been baptized by holy Silvester and cleansed from his leprosy.\" Also see the ''Liber Pontificalis'' for December 31 and the inscription on a side of the St. John Lateran obelisk at Rome which reads, \"CONSTANTINUS PER CRUCEM VICTOR AS SILVESTRO HIC BAPTIZATUS CRUCIS GLORIAM PROPAGAVIT.\" (''Della Letteratura Italiana'', by Cesare Cant\u00f9.

A year and a half later, on Monday 11 May 330, when the festival of Saint Mocius was celebrated, the city was finally dedicated. The goddess [[Tyche]] was invited to come and live in the city, and her statue was placed in the hand of the statue of the emperor that was on top of the [[Column of Constantine]], on the Forum with the same name. Although by now Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan religions: there were shrines for the [[Dioscuri]] and [[Tyche]]. The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles.

In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Evaluation and legacy==\nExcept for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>\n\nHarold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, among them [[Judaism]], which was seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].\n\nPeter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews and Christians), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered.

The goddess [[Tyche]] was invited to come and live in the city, and her statue was placed in the hand of the statue of the emperor that was on top of the [[Column of Constantine]], on the Forum with the same name. Although by now Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan religions: there were shrines for the [[Dioscuri]] and [[Tyche]]. The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles. Constantine had continued to engage in pagan rituals.

Pagans used the occasion to attempt to revive the old rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies. With the failure of the revolt of Leontios, some pagans became disillusioned and became Christian, or pretended to do so, in order to avoid persecution.<ref>Pagans were still sufficiently numerous during the reign of Justinian for a law to be published, in 527 (Justinian Code 1.5.12), which barred pagans from office and confiscated their property.</ref> The subjugation of the Roman Empire to Christianity became complete when the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], who came to the throne in 491, was required to sign a written declaration of orthodoxy before his coronation.\n\nUnder [[Pope Gregory I]], the caverns, grottoes, crags and glens that had once been used for the worship of the pagan gods were now [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by Christianity: \"Let altars be built and relics be placed there\" wrote [[Pope Gregory I]], \"so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God.\"<ref name=\"church\">The modern Church takes a much less antagonistic stance to non-Abrahamic religions.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Evaluation and legacy==\nExcept for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>\n\nHarold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, namely [[Druidism]] and [[Judaism]], both of which were seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].\n\nPeter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews, Christians and Druids), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign Gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered. The Romans \"cannot be said to have extended to them the same combination of disapproval and acceptance which is [[religious toleration|toleration]].\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\"/>\n\nThe example of Constantine, Theodosius and Justinian, who were seen as \"godly emperors (...) serving the church and crushing its enemies,\" has been cited repeatedly by Christian authors who endorsed an idea of [[religious persecution]].<ref>John Coffey (2000), ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558-1689'', Studies in Modern History, Pearson Education, p. 31; O. O'Donovan (1996), ''The Desire of the Nations: Rediscovering the Roots of Political Theology'', esp. ch. 6.</ref> According to the historian [[Ramsay MacMullen]], a council of bishops at Toledo in 681 called on civil authorities to seize and [[behead]] all those guilty of non-Christian practices of any sort.<ref>Ramsay MacMullen, \"Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries,\" Chap 1:16, \"Persecution,\" {{ISBN|0-300-07148-5}}</ref> Medieval Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ruled in September 774 that the Saxons (Westfali, Ostfali, and Angrarii) must be presented with the alternative of baptism or death<ref>Thomas J.

His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past.

While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il.

His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past.
