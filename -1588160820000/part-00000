While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture in Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:20190113 Berlin 0510.jpg|thumb|View of [[Gendarmenmarkt]], with the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] to the right and the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] in the back]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.<!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]].

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

{"title_page": "Triple conjunction", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2013}}\n\nA '''triple conjunction''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] event where two [[planet]]s or a planet and a [[star]] meet each other three times in a short period, either in [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] or at the time of [[inferior conjunction]], if an [[inferior planet]] is involved. The visible movement of the planet or the planets in the sky is therefore normally [[Apparent retrograde motion|prograde]] at the first conjunction, [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] at the second conjunction and again prograde at the third conjunction.\n\nThe meeting of three planets is referred to as a particular case of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].\n\nThere are three possible cases of triple conjunctions.\n\n== Of inferior planets with superior planets or stars ==\n{{Disputed|date=April 2013}}\nIf [[Mars]] is in conjunction with the Sun, there is often a triple conjunction between Mars and Mercury or between Mars and Venus. In the events in which Mercury is involved, the second conjunction is invisible because of small elongation from Sun; both other events are difficult to see because of the nearness to [[horizon]] and the relatively low brightness of Mars, which is there always near its greatest distance from Earth, barely visible.\n\nFor a Mars\u2013Venus triple conjunction all three events can almost always be seen, but Mars is dim because of its great distance from the [[Earth]].\n\nTriple conjunctions between the inferior planets Mercury and Venus and the superior planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] or with [[star]]s take place when these objects are at the same time in conjunction to Sun while Mercury or Venus are at inferior conjunction.\nFrequently the second conjunction takes place when both bodies are too close to the Sun in order to be seen, while the other conjunctions are easily visible, especially if the other body is Jupiter, Saturn or a bright star.\n\nWith the dim planets Uranus, Neptune and dwarf planet Pluto the visibility of such an event is difficult, because of the low elongation from Sun.\n\nTriple conjunctions of Mercury and Venus with the exterior planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and dwarf planet Pluto happen relatively frequently (approximately once in 10 years).\nDuring the movement in their inferior conjunction loop Mercury and Venus are always involved in triple conjunctions with some stars. Triple conjunctions with bright stars are as frequent as with exterior planets.\n\n== Between two exterior planets ==\n\nThese are the most interesting triple conjunctions, because all three conjunctions can be seen very easily, because of the great elongation of the planets or stars involved. Triple conjunctions between exterior planets or an exterior planet and a star can only occur when these objects are nearly simultaneously in opposition.\n\nTriple conjunctions between the bright exterior planets are very rare: the last triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter occurred in 1789\u20131790, in 1836\u20131837 and in 1979\u20131980. The next events of this kind will be again in 2123 and in 2169\u20132170.\n\nThe last triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn took place in 1779, 1877 (only in [[right ascension]]) and in 1945\u20131946. The next triple conjunction between these planets will occur in 2148\u20132149, in 2185 and in 2187.\n\nFor both at triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter and for triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn it is possible that two such events follow at an interval of only 2 years. This last happened for Mars and Jupiter in 927 and 929 and will be again in 2742 and 2744. It last happened for Mars and Saturn in 1742\u20131743 and 1744\u20131745 and will occur again in 2185 and 2187.\n\nThe most historically important triple conjunction was that one between Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BCE-5 BCE, which has been proposed as the explanation for the [[star of Bethlehem]]. Triple conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn\u2014so-called [[Greatest Conjunction]]s\u2014last took place in 1682\u20131683, 1821 (only in [[right ascension]]), 1940\u20131941 and 1981. It will not occur again until 2238\u20132239.\n\nThere are more frequent triple conjunctions of Jupiter with Uranus or Neptune. They are unspectacular, but offer a good possibility for amateur astronomers to find these dim planets. The last triple conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus was in 2010\u20132011 and the next will be in 2037\u20132038. The last between Jupiter and Neptune was in 2009 and the next will be in 2047\u20132048.\n\nAt each opposition, because of the visible loop movement of the planets, there are triple conjunctions between the planet and some stars.

Please update as needed.''\n\n[[Category:Astrometry]]\n[[Category:Astrological aspects]]\n[[Category:Conjunctions (astronomy and astrology)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2013}}\n\nA '''triple conjunction''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] event where two [[planet]]s or a planet and a [[star]] meet each other three times in a short period, either in [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] or at the time of [[inferior conjunction]], if an [[inferior planet]] is involved. The visible movement of the planet or the planets in the sky is therefore normally [[Apparent retrograde motion|prograde]] at the first conjunction, [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] at the second conjunction and again prograde at the third conjunction.\n\nThe meeting of three planets is referred to as a particular case of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].\n\nThere are three possible cases of triple conjunctions.\n\n== Of inferior planets with superior planets or stars ==\n{{Disputed|date=April 2013}}\nIf [[Mars]] is in conjunction with the Sun, there is often a triple conjunction between Mars and Mercury or between Mars and Venus. In the events in which Mercury is involved, the second conjunction is invisible because of small elongation from Sun; both other events are difficult to see because of the nearness to [[horizon]] and the relatively low brightness of Mars, which is there always near its greatest distance from Earth, barely visible.\n\nFor a Mars\u2013Venus triple conjunction all three events can almost always be seen, but Mars is dim because of its great distance from the [[Earth]].\n\nTriple conjunctions between the inferior planets Mercury and Venus and the superior planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] or with [[star]]s take place when these objects are at the same time in conjunction to Sun while Mercury or Venus are at inferior conjunction.\nFrequently the second conjunction takes place when both bodies are too close to the Sun in order to be seen, while the other conjunctions are easily visible, especially if the other body is Jupiter, Saturn or a bright star.\n\nWith the dim planets Uranus, Neptune and dwarf planet Pluto the visibility of such an event is difficult, because of the low elongation from Sun.\n\nTriple conjunctions of Mercury and Venus with the exterior planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and dwarf planet Pluto happen relatively frequently (approximately once in 10 years).\nDuring the movement in their inferior conjunction loop Mercury and Venus are always involved in triple conjunctions with some stars. Triple conjunctions with bright stars are as frequent as with exterior planets.\n\n== Between two exterior planets ==\n\nThese are the most interesting triple conjunctions, because all three conjunctions can be seen very easily, because of the great elongation of the planets or stars involved. Triple conjunctions between exterior planets or an exterior planet and a star can only occur when these objects are nearly simultaneously in opposition.\n\nTriple conjunctions between the bright exterior planets are very rare: the last triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter occurred in 1789\u20131790, in 1836\u20131837 and in 1979\u20131980. The next events of this kind will be again in 2123 and in 2169\u20132170.\n\nThe last triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn took place in 1779, 1877 (only in [[right ascension]]) and in 1945\u20131946. The next triple conjunction between these planets will occur in 2148\u20132149, in 2185 and in 2187.\n\nFor both at triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter and for triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn it is possible that two such events follow at an interval of only 2 years. This last happened for Mars and Jupiter in 927 and 929 and will be again in 2742 and 2744. It last happened for Mars and Saturn in 1742\u20131743 and 1744\u20131745 and will occur again in 2185 and 2187.\n\nThe most historically important triple conjunction was that one between Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BCE-5 BCE, which has been proposed as the explanation for the [[star of Bethlehem]]. Triple conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn\u2014so-called [[Greatest Conjunction]]s\u2014last took place in 1682\u20131683, 1821 (only in [[right ascension]]), 1940\u20131941 and 1981. It will not occur again until 2238\u20132239.\n\nThere are more frequent triple conjunctions of Jupiter with Uranus or Neptune. They are unspectacular, but offer a good possibility for amateur astronomers to find these dim planets. The last triple conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus was in 2010\u20132011 and the next will be in 2037\u20132038. The last between Jupiter and Neptune was in 2009 and the next will be in 2047\u20132048.\n\nAt each opposition, because of the visible loop movement of the planets, there are triple conjunctions between the planet and some stars.

By the 1960s the Kitemark was being used to identify safe products in areas such as nightwear, domestic furniture, pressure cookers and motorcycle helmets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/About-BSI-Group/BSI-History/|title=Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment and Certification - BSI Group|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of quality management systems standards in the 1970s Kitemark schemes were developed in areas such as double glazing and fire safety. Today there are more than 450 individual Kitemark schemes covering products as diverse as printed circuit boards and cattle tags, and services as disparate as financial products and flood protection.\n\n== Availability ==\nThe Kitemark is only available from [[BSI Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com|title=Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment and Certification - BSI Group|publisher=}}</ref> To obtain Kitemark certification, products and services are assessed by BSI Product Services to ensure that they meet the requirements of the relevant British, European, trade association or international specification or standard. In addition, delivery of the product or service is audited against an accredited quality management system. Once a Kitemark licence is issued, licensees are regularly audited and are subject to surveillance visits to ensure continuing compliance.\n\n== Market acceptance ==\nThe Kitemark is not a legal requirement, but is often used as a point of differentiation in competitive markets<ref>{{cite web |title=Differentiate your business with BSI Kitemark |url=https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/kitemark/ |website=www.bsigroup.com |publisher=BSI Group |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref> and is widely trusted: a 2006 survey demonstrated that the Kitemark is recognized by 82 per cent of the UK population, 88 per cent of whom trust the Kitemark, 93 per cent of whom believe that Kitemark products are safer, and 91 per cent of whom believe the product is of a better quality than similar products without the Kitemark.<ref>GfK NOP Consumer Survey July 2006</ref> A 2008 [[YouGov]] poll showed that almost half (49 per cent) of UK consumers look for a Kitemark when making a purchase.<ref name=soars>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=250139|title=Kitemark Soars 100 Places in Leading Brands Survey /PR Newswire UK/|first=BSI Product|last=Services|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 the Kitemark was independently voted a Superbrand in the Top 500 Business Superbrands in the UK.<ref name=soars/>\n\n== Examples of Kitemark schemes ==\n* Building Information Modelling (BIM)\n* Balustrading\n* Car accident repair\n* Car servicing\n* Carbon monoxide detectors\n* Customer service\n* Fire extinguishers\n* Windows and doors\n* Glass\n* Plugs and sockets\n* Prophylactics\n* Motorcycle helmets\n* Horse riding helmets\n* Ladders\n* Flood barriers\n\n== Misuse of \"Kitemark\" ==\nThe word \"Kitemark\" is a [[registered trade mark]] of the British Standards Institution.
