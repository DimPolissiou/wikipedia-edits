In 1966 from ''Django'' he went on to appear in eight more films released that year including ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' (1966) and ''[[Massacre Time]]''.\n\nIn 1967, he appeared in ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' as [[Lancelot]], where he met his longtime romantic partner, and later on in life his wife, [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. Following this he appeared in [[the mafia]] film  ''[[Il giorno della civetta (film)|Il giorno della civetta]]'' opposite [[Claudia Cardinale]] released in 1968.\n\nA lack of proficiency in English tended to limit these roles, although he also appeared in other English-language films including ''[[The Virgin and the Gypsy (film)|The Virgin and the Gypsy]]'' (1970), ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978), ''[[Enter the Ninja]]'' (1981) and ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990).\n\nAlthough often typecast in films like ''[[Deaf Smith & Johnny Ears|Los amigos]]'' (1973) or ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976) he has attempted an impressive range of characters, such as [[Abel]] in [[John Huston]]'s epic ''[[The Bible: In The Beginning]]'' (1966), the humiliated engineer out for revenge in ''[[Street Law (film)|Street Law]]'', the gay lieutenant in ''[[Querelle]]'' (1982) and [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian]] mediaeval hero in ''[[The Falcon (film)|The Falcon]]'' (1983).

Thus, some writers are of the opinion that the word Biate originates from the term ''Rul-Bia-Te'' or ''Rul-Biak-Te'', which means ''snake-worshippers'' in other dialects. However, this hypothesis is questionable, because the Biates, as a tribe, never fed or worshipped a snake except one.<ref name=\"Thiaite\"/> The offering sacrifices by one village was also not as worshiping a God, but due to their fear and timidity and that too only for some time.<ref name=\"app-153\"/> Some other tribes call them in different names.

The ancient home of the Biates is also known as [[Sinlung]] (Sinlung means the core of Sin or cave close with stone) supposedly believed to be the [[Qin dynasty]] ruled by [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The conjecture of Sinlung as the origin of the Biate tribe is strongly supported by a folk song about the glory of Sinlung:\n\n:''\"Ken siangna Sinlung ram mingthang,<br /> Kinu ram kipa ram ngai;<br /> Chongzil ang koi kir thei chang se,<br /> Kinu ram kipa ram ngai.\"''\n\n:''\"My genesis famous land of Sinlung,<br /> Land of my mother and father;<br /> Could it be called back like Chongzil,<br /> Land of my mother and father.\"''\n\nThe word ''chongzil'' seems to be a [[mispronunciation]] of [[Changzhi]], a place in the province of [[Shanxi]], in [[Central China]]. Chongzil is the place where the Biate ancestors began their historical migration. Tracing back through orally histories, the Biate tribe with its cognate clans may have started a migration from China between 206 B. C. and 202 BC\u2014between the fall of the [[Shi Huang]] kingdom and the emergence of the [[Han dynasty]]. Their migration, according to L. H.

Their migration is believed to have been a search for better land.\n\nLamlira marked the land with his handiwork by moulding stones in different shape and sizes like man, animal, stone altar and different kind of vessels called [[Lungzubel]] which literally means \"Stone rice beer container\" in the Biate language. The artefacts could still be seen today in all Biate dominated areas and some other areas of Assam and Meghalaya which are also believed to have been inhabited by the Biates in olden days. Pakem, also wrote that these round stones and hollow ground resemble those found in the nearby Sumer Elaka, between Umkyurpong and Kseh villages in Meghalaya. He also believed that it might have been the sacrificial or dancing places of the Biates forefathers of the forerunner.<ref name=\"Pakem\"/> In Biate it is called \u2018Lamlira Lung Sin\u2019 meaning \u2018handiwork of Lamlira\u2019  Many of the relics were gradually destroyed over time, by nature or man, as it was left abandoned and unguarded so long.

B. Pakem, stated that the period under reference might have referred to the popular Biate in Mizoram and not to the Biates of Assam and Meghalaya.<ref name=\"Pakem\"/> The Biate dialect is akin to [[Mizo language|Mizo]] (Lushai), [[Hmar|Khawsak]] [[Hmar|/ Hmar]] etc. Biate tribe have five major clans, and there are about 49 sub-clans. The five major clans are Nampui, Darnei, Ngamlai, Ngirsim (Lalsim) and Thiaite. Sub-clans of the Biate tribe are : \n1.Chungngol \n2.Kungte \n3.Thianglai\n4. Betlu \n5. Bapui\n6. Zamate \n7.

They build their house with a rise platform, about 3 or 4 feet from the ground, is first put up and on this an ordinary hut is erected and a [[thatched roof]] with grass or cane leaves. In front of the main entrance, a space is left for veranda. The interior of the house is partitioned off into two, three and sometimes more rooms, according to the number of inmates. Houses in the villages are built facing one another with a broad path running in the centre.\n\n==Marriage==\nIn [[marriage]] alliances a Biate is not restricted to any particular clan or sub-clan. Intermarriage may take place within the clan or the sub-clans; preference is given to marry other sub-clans of the tribe. A Biate can marry any woman but must avoid blood relations. The marriageable age for the male and female are 21 and 18 years respectively. If the boy is willing to marry a girl, a negotiator (Palai), usually the boy\u2019s relative is sent to negotiate with the girl\u2019s parents. This is called ''Ibiak'', which is basically an [[engagement]]. If negotiation is successful, the parents fix a wedding date. The night of the wedding, the groom's family pays the [[bride price]] to the girl parents, around INR 185.00, and a bronze or copper plate called Mairang. According to tradition, the groom stays for seven years for 'Mak-sin' or 'in-law's duty' in his father-in-law's house, to assist them and develop a good relationship with his new family. At present, it is reduced to three years, but few practice this custom now. [[Divorce]] is rare, usually only for reasons like [[adultery]], cruelty, barrenness, maladjustment, [[impotence]], or [[insanity]].<ref name=Bareh>{{Cite book| title=Encyclopedia of the North East India: Mzoram.

Women are not allowed to inherit family properties. The eldest and the middle sons also have no right to claim the family properties. The youngest son is the formal heir who lives with his parents and has the responsibility of looking after his parents in their old age. But there are no hard and fast rules with regards to [[inheritance]]. All sons and daughters can share the family properties according to the will of their father. The whole family uses the clan name as surname by the whole family; the sons take his father surname throughout their life.\n\n==Taboos==\nThe words [[taboo]] in Biate dialect is \u2018iser\u2019, \u2018ikhap\u2019 or \u2018rithiangino.\u2019 They believe in various taboos. For instance, the Biate man must avoid [[sexual intercourse]] with his wife before going to war or hunting. It is believed that failure to observe this will lead them to dangerous situation or death or defeat by the enemies. Another belief is that, while a wife is pregnant, the husband must not kill an animal. Even today, many believe that violating this would affect the child in the mother\u2019s womb. Biate women are not allowed to carry a pair of machetes, axe etc., during [[pregnancy]]. They may not eat any conjoint fruits or vegetable. They believe that if a woman eats these during pregnancy, she will bear twins with severe problem.\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically, the Biate tribe practiced [[animism]], but they also strongly believed in a supreme being called ''Chung Pathian''\u2014which means the God above. They believe and feel the omnipresence, and thus acknowledge that Chung Pathian is above all gods. Meanwhile, the primordial god of the earth is called \u2018Nuaia Malal\u2019. Other primal gods and goddesses were Bolong Raja or Tarpa, Theisini Kara, Khua Vuai, Dangdo, Fapite, Sangkuru, Truanpuia etc. With the coming of Welsh Missionary Rev. Robert Evan and the Khasi missionary Mr. Khulu Malang the Biate embraced [[Christianity]] in the year 1890.<ref name=Lalsim>{{Cite book| title=The Interaction of Christianity With the Customary Laws of the Biate Tribe. A thesis (Unpublished)| author=Lalsim, R.T. | year=1999 | page=19 | edition= | publisher=Bishop\u2019s College Calcutta | location=Calcutta,India}}</ref> In fact the whole Biate population had embraced Christianity by the time it celebrated its hundred years of Christianity in 1990. The Quasquicentennial (125 years) Jubilee of Christianity was recently celebrated in the month of December'2015 by the Biates with soulful and prayer meetings held in all Biate dominated areas of Northeast India.\n\n==Administration==\nUnlike other tribes, the Biate have a self-governing [[Democracy|democratic]] administration\u2014which they introduced after reaching the hills of [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]]\u2014known as Kalim Kabur Dan (Law of the Chiefs). They are headed by the two head chiefs of the entire community, a Kalim and Kabur who is aided by the Lalchor or secretary to look after the affairs of the community. Each village has their own Siarkalim (Village Chief), and under him, several people are appointed for the Village Council. The Khochor (Secretary) and Thlangva is the village announcer. Any matter relating to marriage, disputes, quarrels and fight etc. are brought before the court of Namringa Devan (Court of the five clans), which is headed by Kalim and Kabur through the Siarkalim. At present the whole Biate tribe is administered by the court called 'Biate Devanpui' meaning 'The Biates Supreme Court'. This apex body looks after the internal and external matter of the community except the law dealt by the chiefs Kalim and kabur.\n\n==Economy==\nAs regard to their economic life, their main occupation is [[agriculture]] and they practice shifting cultivation (Loi). Each year before they start sowing their millet, rice, maize etc. the villagers observe \u2018Chichoi\u2019 or \u2018Burit-in-om\u2019 for one day. The day is spent by praying to God to ensure good crops and good luck.The year is divided into four main seasons, Khothral-Spring, Fur-Summer, Favang-Autumn, Phalbi-Winter. The Biate's economic life, especially among the rural population largely revolved around these four seasons.\nEven though the majority of the Biates are still dependent on subsistent agriculture, the number of Biates working in government and private sectors in towns and cities are growing gradually with the spread of education.\n\n==Clothes and dresses==\n[[Image:EarlyTraditional dress.JPG|thumb|alt=Traditional dress worn during the early days|Early traditional dress]]\nLike all other [[hill tribes of North East India]], the Biates have their own cloth making system since time immemorial. A blanket (Puanpui) made out of cotton is highly regarded for the customary marriage gift. Besides cotton work, the Biates have a tradition of rearing [[silkworm]]. A shawl (Rilungpuan) and headgear (Lukom) is manufactured out of the silk thread. Among the Chin-Kuki-Mizo group, the Biates, Hrangkhols and Sakacheps (Khelma) are the only tribes who practice weaving silk clothings since time immemorial.<ref name=Ramdin>{{Cite book| title=Biate Pipu Toisong (Culture and Historical Backgrounds of the Biate)| author=Lalsim, R.| year=1995 | page=81 | edition= | publisher=Directorate of Cultural Affairs| location=Assam}}</ref> The common dresses of Biate men and women are Puanbom (Mekhla), Zakua (shirt), Luk\u00f4m or Satoldiayr (headgear), Rilungpuan, Choipuan (especially for women to put over their shoulders), Puandam (a white rectangular piece of cloth with black border on longer sides and black woven motifs with the Vangsake pattern). Ritai Sam ep (a hairband made out of sliced cane and bamboo), Rithei (beads) Sumngoi Banbun (silver bangles), Kuarbet (earring), Toya (round earring like horn), Zakser (arm ring) and Kaipereng is a flap of cloth hanging in front and back to cover the private parts.\n\n==Festivals and dances==\n The Biate have many kinds of festivals; Nulding Kut, Pamchar Kut, Lebang Kut, Favang Kut etc. for different occasion. They no longer practise or observe those festivals except \u2018Nulding Kut'. The word Nulding means renewal of life and Kut indicates a festival. Thus, Nulding Kut literally means the Festival of the Renewal of Life. Nulding Kut is observed every year on 11 January with singing, dancing, and traditional games\u2014after the Priest (Thiampu) pray to Chung Pathian to bless them in every sphere of life. Apart from these, many community events are organized on this day where Biates from every age group clothing themselves in colourful traditional attires assemble to celebrate the festival.Various dances include, Dar l\u00e2m, Sikpui-Zoll\u00e2m, Buantum l\u00e2m, Lampalak, Kolrikhek l\u00e2m, Rikifachoi, Ar-ek inuai l\u00e2m, Mebur l\u00e2m, Sul-ribum l\u00e2m, Tuipui lenthluk, Chichoi-lam, Parton l\u00e2m, Tuihol Sirphaia  Chitu-a l\u00e2m, and Salu aih-l\u00e2m. The year is  divided into four main seasons, Khothral-Spring, Fur-Summer, Favang-Autumn, Phalbi-Winter.[[Image:Zamluang.jpg|thumb|A Zamluang]]\n\n==Musical instruments==\nThe Biate play various musical instruments\u2014such as, ''khuang'' (a drum), ''jamluang'' (a large gong), ''dar-ribu'' (a set of small brass cymbals), ''rosem'' (a wind instrument), ''theile (a small bamboo flute), tringtrang (a stringed instrument. The modern [[guitar]] is called a ''perkhuang''. A ''seranda'', similar to a modern violin, is made from a dried gourd. It generally has three strings and a bow made of palm hair. The ''theiphit'' is a [[whistle]] made from a simple stalk of bamboo with one end open for blowing. The ''chompereng\u2014similar to a [[mandolin]], is generally played while camping in the jhum ([[shifting cultivation]]) Hut.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Jamchonga Nampui]], the first tribal [[Indian Administrative Services]] (IAS) officer in India.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Biate}}\n* [http://www.biatevision.com/ Biate Vision][Biate Website]Founder : Emerald L Darnei in collaboration with William L Nampui\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=JlHhTlPpanIC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=biate&source=bl&ots=F65Q-k3KSm&sig=gojqyBCYjGI8Xiioyl_q-kqQTjE&hl=en&ei=z0GbTLPCA4TGvQPj77z8BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=biate&f=false Hamlet Bareh] Encyclopaedia of the North-East India, Mizoram.\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=biu Biate-A language of India]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518110007/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2313/stories/20060714001904200.htm Frontline ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155549/http://diprnchills.gov.in/gallery_people.htm Biate Couple] Coulorful People of N.C.Hills\n* [http://nchills.gov.in/NCHILLS-bietes.htm Tribes of N.C.Hills] The Biate\n* [http://nchills.nic.in/NCHILLS-GLANCE.htm The North Cachar Hills]\n\n{{Kuki-Chin-Mizo tribes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biate (Tribe)}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in India]]\n[[Category:Kuki tribes]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India]]\n[[Category:Hill tribes of Northeast India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ethnic group\n| image = Biate traditional dress present.JPG\n| group = Biate\n| population = \n| regions = [[India]]<br/><span style=\"font-size:90%;\">[[Assam]]{{\u00b7}} [[Meghalaya]]{{\u00b7}} [[Mizoram]]{{\u00b7}} [[Tripura]]{{\u00b7}} [[Manipur]]</span>\n| languages = [[Biate language|Biate]]{{\u00b7}} [[Mizo language|Mizo]]{{\u00b7}} [[Khasi language|Khasi]]{{\u00b7}} [[Hindi]]{{\u00b7}}[[Assamese language|Assamese]]{{\u00b7}} [[English language|English]]\n| religions = [[Christianity]]\n| related = [[Chin people|Chin]]{{\u00b7}} [[Kuki people|Kuki]]{{\u00b7}} [[Mizo people|Mizo]]\n}}\nThe '''Biates''' are one of the oldest tribes of [[Assam]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Meghalaya]].

The word \u2018Bia\u2019 or \u2018Biak\u2019 means \u2018speak\u2019 or \u2018worship\u2019. \u2018Te\u2019 is a suffix denoting plurality.

Thus, some writers are of the opinion that the word Biate originates from the term ''Rul-Bia-Te'' or ''Rul-Biak-Te'', which means ''snake-worshippers'' in other dialects.

Riama (ancestor of the Biate tribe) descended by Kuangpuia and Vaia, who were descended by Khuangzang, Khuangsai, Chilzang, and Lamzang (Lamkang). Kuangpuia had a son named Ralkhana, whose wife Kolsingi gave birth to five children namely Beia, Thianga, Laia, Ngola and Thiaia.<ref name=Anon>{{Cite book| title=Tu hei\u2019m Biate (Who are the Biate), | author=Anonymous | year=2010 | page= | edition= | publisher=Kolnisua, Biate Monthly News Magazine Vol. 5,August,No. 7 | location=Fiangpui,N.C.Hills}}</ref>\n\nThey are believed to have originated from a place called Khurpui or great cave. The ancient home of the Biates is also known as [[Sinlung]] (Sinlung means the core of Sin or cave close with stone) supposedly believed to be the [[Qin dynasty]] ruled by [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The conjecture of Sinlung as the origin of the Biate tribe is strongly supported by a folk song about the glory of Sinlung:\n\n:''\"Ken siangna Sinlung ram mingthang,<br /> Kinu ram kipa ram ngai;<br /> Chongzil ang koi kir thei chang se,<br /> Kinu ram kipa ram ngai.\"''\n\n:''\"My genesis famous land of Sinlung,<br /> Land of my mother and father;<br /> Could it be called back like Chongzil,<br /> Land of my mother and father.\"''\n\nThe word ''chongzil'' seems to be a [[mispronunciation]] of [[Changzhi]], a place in the province of [[Shanxi]], in [[Central China]]. Chongzil is the place where the Biate ancestors began their historical migration. Tracing back through orally histories, the Biate tribe with its cognate clans may have started a migration from China between 206 B. C. and 202 BC\u2014between the fall of the [[Shi Huang]] kingdom and the emergence of the [[Han dynasty]]. Their migration, according to L. H. Songate, was due to acute oppression and maltreatment in the construction of that great wall or fortress by a cruel king Shi-Huang.

The Biates by spreading to all sides of the corner of Mizoram settled for nearly a thousand years, numerous hills and mountain, rivers, lakes, and places of Mizoram were named by the Biates, being a forerunner of the land. While they were settling in and around Invol (believed to be present day [[Lunglei district]]) they were invaded by the [[kingdom of Ava]] (1364\u20131555), a new kingdom founded by king [[Thadominbya]] after the [[Mongols]] left the Irrawaddy valley, [[Burma]].<ref name=Ava>{{Cite book| title=Ava | author=Anonymous | year=2010 }}</ref> During the invasion, one of the Biate clan the Ralvong Thiaite was hiding in a Ralvawng cave.

The five major clans are Nampui, Darnei, Ngamlai, Ngirsim (Lalsim) and Thiaite. Sub-clans of the Biate tribe are : \n1.Chungngol \n2.Kungte \n3.Thianglai\n4. Betlu \n5. Bapui\n6. Zamate \n7.

They build their house with a rise platform, about 3 or 4 feet from the ground, is first put up and on this an ordinary hut is erected and a [[thatched roof]] with grass or cane leaves. In front of the main entrance, a space is left for veranda. The interior of the house is partitioned off into two, three and sometimes more rooms, according to the number of inmates. Houses in the villages are built facing one another with a broad path running in the centre.\n\n==Marriage==\nIn [[marriage]] alliances a Biate is not restricted to any particular clan or sub-clan. Intermarriage may take place within the clan or the sub-clans; preference is given to get married to other sub-clan of the tribe. A Biate can marry any woman but must avoid blood relations. The marriageable age for the male and female are 21 and 18 years respectively. If the boy is willing to marry a girl, a negotiator (Palai), usually the boy\u2019s relative is sent to negotiate with the girl\u2019s parents. This is called ''Ibiak'', which is basically an [[engagement]]. If negotiation is successful, the parents fix a wedding date. The night of the wedding, the groom's family pays the [[bride price]] to the girl parents, around INR 185.00, and a bronze or copper plate called Mairang. According to tradition, the groom stays for seven years for 'Mak-sin' or 'in-law's duty' in his father-in-law's house, to assist them and develop a good relationship with his new family. At present, it is reduced to three years, but few practice this custom now. [[Divorce]] is rare, usually only for reasons like [[adultery]], cruelty, barrenness, maladjustment, [[impotence]], or [[insanity]].<ref name=Bareh>{{Cite book| title=Encyclopedia of the North East India: Mzoram.

Women are not allowed to inherit family properties. The eldest and the middle sons also have no right to claim the family properties. The youngest son is the formal heir who lives with his parents and has the responsibility of looking after his parents in their old age. But there are no hard and fast rules with regards to [[inheritance]]. All sons and daughters can share the family properties according to the will of their father. The whole family uses the clan name as surname by the whole family; the sons take his father surname throughout their life.\n\n==Taboos==\nThe words [[taboo]] in Biate dialect is \u2018iser\u2019, \u2018ikhap\u2019 or \u2018rithiangino.\u2019 They believe in various taboos. For instance, the Biate man must avoid [[sexual intercourse]] with his wife before going to war or hunting. It is believed that failure to observe this will lead them to dangerous situation or death or defeat by the enemies. Another belief is that, while a wife is pregnant, the husband must not kill an animal. Even today, many believe that violating this would affect the child in the mother\u2019s womb. Biate women are not allowed to carry a pair of machetes, axe etc., during [[pregnancy]]. They may not eat any conjoint fruits or vegetable. They believe that if a woman eats these during pregnancy, she will bear twins with severe problem.\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically, the Biate tribe practiced [[animism]], but they also strongly believed in a supreme being called ''Chung Pathian''\u2014which means the God above. They believe and feel the omnipresence, and thus acknowledge that Chung Pathian is above all gods. Meanwhile, the primordial god of the earth is called \u2018Nuaia Malal\u2019. Other primal gods and goddesses were Bolong Raja or Tarpa, Theisini Kara, Khua Vuai, Dangdo, Fapite, Sangkuru, Truanpuia etc. With the coming of Welsh Missionary Rev. Robert Evan and the Khasi missionary Mr. Khulu Malang the Biate embraced [[Christianity]] in the year 1890.<ref name=Lalsim>{{Cite book| title=The Interaction of Christianity With the Customary Laws of the Biate Tribe. A thesis (Unpublished)| author=Lalsim, R.T. | year=1999 | page=19 | edition= | publisher=Bishop\u2019s College Calcutta | location=Calcutta,India}}</ref> In fact the whole Biate population had embraced Christianity by the time it celebrated its hundred years of Christianity in 1990. The Quasquicentennial (125 years) Jubilee of Christianity was recently celebrated in the month of December'2015 by the Biates with soulful and prayer meetings held in all Biate dominated areas of Northeast India.\n\n==Administration==\nUnlike other tribes, the Biate have a self-governing [[Democracy|democratic]] administration\u2014which they introduced after reaching the hills of [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]]\u2014known as Kalim Kabur Dan (Law of the Chiefs). They are headed by the two head chiefs of the entire community, a Kalim and Kabur who is aided by the Lalchor or secretary to look after the affairs of the community. Each village has their own Siarkalim (Village Chief), and under him, several people are appointed for the Village Council. The Khochor (Secretary) and Thlangva is the village announcer. Any matter relating to marriage, disputes, quarrels and fight etc. are brought before the court of Namringa Devan (Court of the five clans), which is headed by Kalim and Kabur through the Siarkalim. At present the whole Biate tribe is administered by the court called 'Biate Devanpui' meaning 'The Biates Supreme Court'. This apex body looks after the internal and external matter of the community except the law dealt by the chiefs Kalim and kabur.\n\n==Economy==\nAs regard to their economic life, their main occupation is [[agriculture]] and they practice shifting cultivation (Loi). Each year before they start sowing their millet, rice, maize etc. the villagers observe \u2018Chichoi\u2019 or \u2018Burit-in-om\u2019 for one day. The day is spent by praying to God to ensure good crops and good luck.The year is divided into four main seasons, Khothral-Spring, Fur-Summer, Favang-Autumn, Phalbi-Winter. The Biate's economic life, especially among the rural population largely revolved around these four seasons.\nEven though the majority of the Biates are still dependent on subsistent agriculture, the number of Biates working in government and private sectors in towns and cities are growing gradually with the spread of education.\n\n==Clothes and dresses==\n[[Image:EarlyTraditional dress.JPG|thumb|alt=Traditional dress worn during the early days|Early traditional dress]]\nLike all other [[hill tribes of North East India]], the Biates have their own cloth making system since time immemorial. A blanket (Puanpui) made out of cotton is highly regarded for the customary marriage gift. Besides cotton work, the Biates have a tradition of rearing [[silkworm]]. A shawl (Rilungpuan) and headgear (Lukom) is manufactured out of the silk thread. Among the Chin-Kuki-Mizo group, the Biates, Hrangkhols and Sakacheps (Khelma) are the only tribes who practice weaving silk clothings since time immemorial.<ref name=Ramdin>{{Cite book| title=Biate Pipu Toisong (Culture and Historical Backgrounds of the Biate)| author=Lalsim, R.| year=1995 | page=81 | edition= | publisher=Directorate of Cultural Affairs| location=Assam}}</ref> The common dresses of Biate men and women are Puanbom (Mekhla), Zakua (shirt), Luk\u00f4m or Satoldiayr (headgear), Rilungpuan, Choipuan (especially for women to put over their shoulders), Puandam (a white rectangular piece of cloth with black border on longer sides and black woven motifs with the Vangsake pattern). Ritai Sam ep (a hairband made out of sliced cane and bamboo), Rithei (beads) Sumngoi Banbun (silver bangles), Kuarbet (earring), Toya (round earring like horn), Zakser (arm ring) and Kaipereng is a flap of cloth hanging in front and back to cover the private parts.\n\n==Festivals and dances==\n The Biate have many kinds of festivals; Nulding Kut, Pamchar Kut, Lebang Kut, Favang Kut etc. for different occasion. They no longer practise or observe those festivals except \u2018Nulding Kut'. The word Nulding means renewal of life and Kut indicates a festival. Thus, Nulding Kut literally means the Festival of the Renewal of Life. Nulding Kut is observed every year on 11 January with singing, dancing, and traditional games\u2014after the Priest (Thiampu) pray to Chung Pathian to bless them in every sphere of life. Apart from these, many community events are organized on this day where Biates from every age group clothing themselves in colourful traditional attires assemble to celebrate the festival.Various dances include, Dar l\u00e2m, Sikpui-Zoll\u00e2m, Buantum l\u00e2m, Lampalak, Kolrikhek l\u00e2m, Rikifachoi, Ar-ek inuai l\u00e2m, Mebur l\u00e2m, Sul-ribum l\u00e2m, Tuipui lenthluk, Chichoi-lam, Parton l\u00e2m, Tuihol Sirphaia  Chitu-a l\u00e2m, and Salu aih-l\u00e2m. The year is  divided into four main seasons, Khothral-Spring, Fur-Summer, Favang-Autumn, Phalbi-Winter.[[Image:Zamluang.jpg|thumb|A Zamluang]]\n\n==Musical instruments==\nThe Biate play various musical instruments\u2014such as, ''khuang'' (a drum), ''jamluang'' (a large gong), ''dar-ribu'' (a set of small brass cymbals), ''rosem'' (a wind instrument), ''theile (a small bamboo flute), tringtrang (a stringed instrument. The modern [[guitar]] is called a ''perkhuang''. A ''seranda'', similar to a modern violin, is made from a dried gourd. It generally has three strings and a bow made of palm hair. The ''theiphit'' is a [[whistle]] made from a simple stalk of bamboo with one end open for blowing. The ''chompereng\u2014similar to a [[mandolin]], is generally played while camping in the jhum ([[shifting cultivation]]) Hut.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Jamchonga Nampui]], the first tribal [[Indian Administrative Services]] (IAS) officer in India.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Biate}}\n* [http://www.biatevision.com/ Biate Vision][Biate Website]Founder : Emerald L Darnei in collaboration with William L Nampui\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=JlHhTlPpanIC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=biate&source=bl&ots=F65Q-k3KSm&sig=gojqyBCYjGI8Xiioyl_q-kqQTjE&hl=en&ei=z0GbTLPCA4TGvQPj77z8BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=biate&f=false Hamlet Bareh] Encyclopaedia of the North-East India, Mizoram.\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=biu Biate-A language of India]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518110007/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2313/stories/20060714001904200.htm Frontline ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155549/http://diprnchills.gov.in/gallery_people.htm Biate Couple] Coulorful People of N.C.Hills\n* [http://nchills.gov.in/NCHILLS-bietes.htm Tribes of N.C.Hills] The Biate\n* [http://nchills.nic.in/NCHILLS-GLANCE.htm The North Cachar Hills]\n\n{{Kuki-Chin-Mizo tribes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biate (Tribe)}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in India]]\n[[Category:Kuki tribes]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India]]\n[[Category:Hill tribes of Northeast India]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biate_people"}

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Certain publishers and journalists consider G2A a [[grey market]]place for redemption keys, often allowing the reselling of keys purchased in one regional market at a much lower price into another region where the same game is priced much higher, a legal route but one that denies publishers some profit in the latter region. However, G2A only acts as an intermediary for individuals selling their keys, sometimes bought with stolen credit cards are sold, ensuring cheap prices for these keys.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://kotaku.com/how-the-controversial-steam-key-marketplace-g2a-got-so-1784669708\n| title=How The Controversial Steam Key Marketplace G2A Got So Big\n| date=2016-01-08\n| publisher=[[Kotaku]]\n| quote=It's cheaper because individuals are selling the keys, not Blizzard.

It one of the oldest and most elaborate [[passion play]]s in [[Mexico]] as well as the best known, covered by media both in Mexico and abroad. Unlike others in [[Latin America]], its origins are not in the colonial period but rather in a [[cholera]] epidemic in the 19th century, which gave rise to a procession to petition relief. Over time, the procession included a passion play which grew to include various scenes related to Holy Week.

As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de la Cuevita\u201d( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of [[Pueblo Culhuac\u00e1n]] .<ref name=zedillo/><ref name=cnnmex>{{cite news |title= Semana Santa en Iztapalapa, patrimonio intangible de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico   |url= http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/04/03/semana-santa-en-iztapalapa-patrimonio-intangible-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico |newspaper=CNN M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |date=April 3, 2012  |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Week in Iztapalapa, intangible heritage of Mexico City }}</ref> When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday and over time, the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week.<ref name=once/> Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the [[New Fire ceremony]]. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well.<ref name=zedillo/>\n\nCatholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that [[Emiliano Zapata]] lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=zedillo/><ref name=draw100s/> Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante\u2019s [[Divine Comedy]]. Examples of deviation include King Herod\u2019s [[harem]] which performs a sensual [[belly dance]]. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa\u2019s demographic change from indigenous to mestizo.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/>\n\nThe popularity of the performance began to significant increase after [[World War II]], attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad.

As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de la Cuevita\u201d( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of [[Pueblo Culhuac\u00e1n]] .<ref name=zedillo/><ref name=cnnmex>{{cite news |title= Semana Santa en Iztapalapa, patrimonio intangible de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico   |url= http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/04/03/semana-santa-en-iztapalapa-patrimonio-intangible-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico |newspaper=CNN M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |date=April 3, 2012  |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Week in Iztapalapa, intangible heritage of Mexico City }}</ref> When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday and over time, the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week.<ref name=once/> Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the [[New Fire ceremony]]. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well.<ref name=zedillo/>\n\nCatholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that [[Emiliano Zapata]] lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=zedillo/><ref name=draw100s/> Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante\u2019s [[Divine Comedy]]. Examples of deviation include King Herod\u2019s [[harem]] which performs a sensual [[belly dance]]. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa\u2019s demographic change from indigenous to mestizo.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/>\n\nThe popularity of the performance began to significant increase after [[World War II]], attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad. This popularity increased in the 1960s, when [[Vatican II]] legitimated passion reenactments.<ref name=trexler/> It has become the most famous passion play in Mexico.<ref name=cnnmex/> Television coverage of the event began in the 1980s, and since is regularly broadcast to the Spanish speaking world, as well as covered by media in the United States and Europe.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=hcorzo/> While it remains first and foremost a religious event, it has also become a rite of local identity and has brought attention to the poverty of the borough.<ref name=trexler/><ref name=lrohter/> A documentary about the event called Iztapalapa, memoria y tradici\u00f3n was directed by Francisco Alatriste Torres of the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia.<ref name=msuarez>{{cite news |title= Proyectar\u00e1n documental sobre la Semana Santa en Iztapalapa |author= Mariana Su\u00e1rez |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2012/05/29/capital/037n3cap |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=May 29, 2012 |page=37 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Documentary Project about Holy Week in Iztapalapa }}</ref> The city government has declared the event to be an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico City, as part of an effort to gaining similar recognition from [[UNESCO]] .<ref name=patrimonio/> The increased tourism, as well as \u201ccompetition\u201d and influence from other passion plays have had an effect. The urban space where the play takes place has changed to accommodate its growth. Passion plays in the [[Philippines]] have had an influence leading to more realism in the violence, both in the flogging and the crucifixion. The actors have become younger as well as the Nazarenes, which now include some children.<ref name=trexler/>\n\nDue to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Mexico]], the play was moved indoors for the first time in its 177-year history and it was broadcast on television. Fairs, commercial events, pilgrimages, and shows associated with [[Holy Week in Mexico]] were also suspended.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[La Jornada]]|title=Suspenden Viacrucis de Iztapalapa; actos a puerta cerrada y v\u00eda tv |language=es|trans-title=Way of the Cross of Iztapalapa suspended; acts behind closed doors and via tv|date=March 17, 2020|accessdate=March 29, 2020|url=https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/capital/2020/03/17/cancelan-viacrucis-de-iztapalapa-5742.html}}</ref> Schools were closed and vacationers were advised to stay away from beaches and other tourist attractions.
