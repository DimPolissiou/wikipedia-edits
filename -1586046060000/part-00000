It was released in October 2007,<ref name=\"announce\"/> and is published by [[2K Sports]]. A sequel, ''[[MLB Power Pros 2008]]'', came out in 2008.

There are options for a day game or night game, number of innings, what stadium to play at, lineup selection etc. Players may also play exhibition mode with two players, or can watch a game against two teams with the computer controlling both teams and take the role of a spectator.\n\n===Success mode===\nThe story-based Success Mode, which has been a regular element in the Japanese series (main series) since the third release, mixes traditional [[Role-playing game|role playing]] elements with baseball scenarios, following the player as he starts from a [[college]] baseball player with the goal of becoming a Major League player.<ref name=\"announce\"/> The player will train their character in numerous games while dealing with other social situations such as the character's academics,<ref name=\"announce\"/> teammate Marvin, and gaining a [[Part-time job|part-time]] job.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Unlike the Japanese installments, My Life mode is not placed in this installment, but it has an ability editor which Japanese version never had, due to the importance and popularity of success mode in Japan. (note: Success mode is the mode which Power Pro Series create original players).\n\nYour character has three years to impress a scout so you will make it to the minor leagues. You will have to improve your character by practicing, studying, earning money in a part-time job, dating, and of course, playing baseball games. You can play any position such as a starting pitcher, reliever, closer, or fielder. Also, you will be given Fate Cards to make a decision. These cards are \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"challenge,\" or \"Marvin.\"\n\n===Season mode===\nIn season mode, you play a General Manager (GM) for ten years (game time), that is, unless you run out of money by the beginning of the year.\n\nYou will begin by choosing Major League mode or Expansion Mode. Major League mode is the 30 major league teams only, Expansion mode is 2 teams and the 30 major league teams. The 2 teams are teams which you can create. You can create their uniform, team name, etc.\n\nYour main goal is to try to win the World Series.\n\nYou can also trade players, play games (or fast forward them) and more. After each season, you can try to negotiate contracts with your team. There is also Spring Training where your team can learn new skills (new pitches, etc.) and develop previously taught skills faster.\n\n===Arrange Team===\nYou can create your own fantasy team and/or fill it with your own created players.  Be warned, however, that in order to use an arrange team in season mode, you must complete Success mode at least once and earn 100,000 in game shop points.  This usually requires several days to several weeks of gameplay.\n\n===Wii Remote and Home Run Derby mode===\nYou can use the [[Wii Remote]] to play an Exhibition game or play Home Run Derby.

Another sequel, MLB Power Pros 2010, came out on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = MLB Power Pros 2010 Available | url = https://www.droidgamers.com/2010/07/01/mlb-power-pros-2010-available/ | accessdate = 2020-01-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Konami smashes onto the App Store with MLB Power Pros Touch 2010 App | url = https://www.mobiletor.com/konami-smashes-onto-the-app-store-with-mlb-power-pros-touch-2010-app/ | accessdate = 2020-01-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nGameplay within ''MLB Power Pros'' features \"easy pick-up and play mechanics\".<ref name=\"announce\"/> The game contains over a dozen gameplay modes,<ref name=\"announce\"/> including a Season Mode and a Success Mode.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Within the former, the player takes the role of a [[Manager (baseball)|General Manager]] of a [[Major League Baseball]] team,<ref name=\"announce\"/> with the goal of winning the [[World Series]].<ref name=\"announce\"/> The player will have control over all the aspects of the team,<ref name=\"announce\"/> including training players, purchasing better equipment, and trading players between teams.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Maximum playtime is 10 years, or the team points run out and you lose (game over).\n\n===Exhibition mode===\nIn this mode, players may play a baseball game against a Major League team. There are options for a day game or night game, number of innings, what stadium to play at, lineup selection etc. Players may also play exhibition mode with two players, or can watch a game against two teams with the computer controlling both teams and take the role of a spectator.\n\n===Success mode===\nThe story-based Success Mode, which has been a regular element in the Japanese series (main series) since the third release, mixes traditional [[Role-playing game|role playing]] elements with baseball scenarios, following the player as he starts from a [[college]] baseball player with the goal of becoming a Major League player.<ref name=\"announce\"/> The player will train their character in numerous games while dealing with other social situations such as the character's academics,<ref name=\"announce\"/> teammate Marvin, and gaining a [[Part-time job|part-time]] job.<ref name=\"announce\"/> Unlike the Japanese installments, My Life mode is not placed in this installment, but it has an ability editor which Japanese version never had, due to the importance and popularity of success mode in Japan. (note: Success mode is the mode which Power Pro Series create original players).\n\nYour character has three years to impress a scout so you will make it to the minor leagues. You will have to improve your character by practicing, studying, earning money in a part-time job, dating, and of course, playing baseball games. You can play any position such as a starting pitcher, reliever, closer, or fielder. Also, you will be given Fate Cards to make a decision. These cards are \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"challenge,\" or \"Marvin.\"\n\n===Season mode===\nIn season mode, you play a General Manager (GM) for ten years (game time), that is, unless you run out of money by the beginning of the year.\n\nYou will begin by choosing Major League mode or Expansion Mode. Major League mode is the 30 major league teams only, Expansion mode is 2 teams and the 30 major league teams. The 2 teams are teams which you can create. You can create their uniform, team name, etc.\n\nYour main goal is to try to win the World Series.\n\nYou can also trade players, play games (or fast forward them) and more. After each season, you can try to negotiate contracts with your team. There is also Spring Training where your team can learn new skills (new pitches, etc.) and develop previously taught skills faster.\n\n===Arrange Team===\nYou can create your own fantasy team and/or fill it with your own created players.  Be warned, however, that in order to use an arrange team in season mode, you must complete Success mode at least once and earn 100,000 in game shop points.  This usually requires several days to several weeks of gameplay.\n\n===Wii Remote and Home Run Derby mode===\nYou can use the [[Wii Remote]] to play an Exhibition game or play Home Run Derby. In home run derby, you will try to hit home runs with any player (including pitchers) at any stadium in 10 swings. If you hit a home run on every one of those 10 swings, you get extra swings until you get out. You can try to beat your high score. Your high score includes how many home runs hit, the distance traveled, etc. You can also choose the difficulty.

The barreled style was used by knights in most European armies between about 1220 to 1350 AD and evolved into the [[frog-mouth helm]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} to be primarily used during jousting contests.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tournament helmet padding cropped.png|thumb|upright|Great helms were worn with cloth and fiber padding on the inside, here shown removed from the helmet.]]\nIn its simplest form, the great helm was a flat-topped cylinder of steel that completely covered the head and had only very small openings for the eyes and mouth. Later designs gained more of a curved design, particularly on the top, to deflect or lessen the impact of blows.\n\nThe great helm ultimately evolved from the [[nasal helmet]], which had been produced in a flat-topped variant with a square profile by about 1180.<ref>Gravett, p. 17</ref> From this type of helmet an intermediate type, called an '[[enclosed helmet]]' or 'primitive great helm', developed near the end of the 12th century. In this helmet the expansion of the nasal produced a full face-plate, pierced for sight and breathing. This helmet was largely superseded by the true great helm by c. 1240.<ref>Gravett, Plate D and p. 54</ref>\n\nA later variant with a more conical top is known as a 'sugarloaf helm'. In Spanish they are called ''yelmo de Zaragoza'', referring to [[Zaragoza]] where they were introduced for the first time in the Iberian peninsula.<ref>[[David Nicolle]], Medieval Warfare Sourcebook vol I</ref>\n\nAlthough the great helm offered vastly superior protection than previous helmets, such as the nasal helm and [[spangenhelm]], it limited the wearer's peripheral vision, and in addition to being heavy, the mass-produced form (flat-topped without ventilation holes) provided little ventilation and could quickly overheat in hot weather. Knights usually wore the great helm over a mail [[coif]] (hood) sometimes in conjunction with a close-fitting iron skull cap known as a [[cervelliere]]. The later development of the cervelliere, the [[bascinet]], was also worn beneath the great helm; men-at-arms would often remove the great helm after the first clash of lances, for greater vision and freedom of movement in melee combat.  The bascinet had a mail curtain attached, a [[camail]] or aventail, which superseded the coif. Mail throat and neck defences such as these were made obsolete when plate [[gorget]]s were introduced, around 1400.\n\nThe bascinet evolved from its early skull cap form to supersede the great helm for combat. The great helm fell into disuse during the 15th century; however it was used commonly in tournaments where a version of the great helm, the [[Frog-mouth helm|frog-mouthed tilting helm]], evolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_spot_ghelm.html|title=The Great Helm|first=Chad|last=Arnow|website=myArmoury.com}}</ref>\n\n== Decoration ==\n[[File:KHM Wien B 74 - Great helm of Albert von Prankh, 14th century, front.jpg|thumb|upright|Funeral helmet of the [[Pranckh|von Pranckh]] family, 14th century, with the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of two bullhorns. ([[:File:KHM Wien B 74 - Great helm of Albert von Prankh, 14th century, side.jpg|Side view]])]]\nThe Great Helm was often blackened, lacquered or painted, and frequently bore decorations such as:\n* Ventilation decoration (crosses and symbols)\n* Visor (horizontal and vertical \"cross\") decorations\n* [[Crest (heraldry)|Crests]], such as crowns, feathers, caps of maintenance, wings, lions, etc.\n\n==Contemporary reenactors==\nThe great helm is today especially popular amongst [[Live action role-playing game|live-action role players]] and used in [[Medieval reenactment]] of the 13th and 14th centuries. It is inexpensive, easy to manufacture with even rudimentary equipment (metal scissors, drill, rudimentary anvil, rivets and hammer), and provides good protection for the head against both sharp and blunt weapons. Its biggest drawback is the square edges, that crumple very easily under blunt force trauma, and poor ventilation and air circulation. This can make it very hot in warm weather, although not much heavier, hotter or more cumbersome than a number of other medieval helmet styles.

The barreled style was used by knights in most European armies between about 1220 to 1350 AD and evolved into the [[frog-mouth helm]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} to be primarily used during jousting contests.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tournament helmet padding cropped.png|thumb|upright|Great helms were worn with cloth and fiber padding on the inside, here shown removed from the helmet.]]\nIn its simplest form, the great helm was a flat-topped cylinder of steel that completely covered the head and had only very small openings for the eyes and mouth. Later designs gained more of a curved design, particularly on the top, to deflect or lessen the impact of blows.\n\nThe great helm ultimately evolved from the [[nasal helmet]], which had been produced in a flat-topped variant with a square profile by about 1180.<ref>Gravett, p. 17</ref> From this type of helmet an intermediate type, called an '[[enclosed helmet]]' or 'primitive great helm', developed near the end of the 12th century. In this helmet the expansion of the nasal produced a full face-plate, pierced for sight and breathing. This helmet was largely superseded by the true great helm by c. 1240.<ref>Gravett, Plate D and p. 54</ref>\n\nA later variant with a more conical top is known as a 'sugarloaf helm'. In Spanish they are called ''yelmo de Zaragoza'', referring to [[Zaragoza]] where they were introduced for the first time in the Iberian peninsula.<ref>[[David Nicolle]], Medieval Warfare Sourcebook vol I</ref>\n\nAlthough the great helm offered vastly superior protection than previous helmets, such as the nasal helm and [[spangenhelm]], it limited the wearer's peripheral vision, and in addition to being heavy, the mass-produced form (flat-topped without ventilation holes) provided little ventilation and could quickly overheat in hot weather. Knights usually wore the great helm over a mail [[coif]] (hood) sometimes in conjunction with a close-fitting iron skull cap known as a [[cervelliere]]. The later development of the cervelliere, the [[bascinet]], was also worn beneath the great helm; men-at-arms would often remove the great helm after the first clash of lances, for greater vision and freedom of movement in melee combat.  The bascinet had a mail curtain attached, a [[camail]] or aventail, which superseded the coif. Mail throat and neck defences such as these were made obsolete when plate [[gorget]]s were introduced, around 1400.\n\nThe bascinet evolved from its early skull cap form to supersede the great helm for combat. The great helm fell into disuse during the 15th century; however it was used commonly in tournaments where a version of the great helm, the [[Frog-mouth helm|frog-mouthed tilting helm]], evolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_spot_ghelm.html|title=The Great Helm|first=Chad|last=Arnow|website=myArmoury.com}}</ref>\n\n== Decoration ==\n[[File:KHM Wien B 74 - Great helm of Albert von Prankh, 14th century, front.jpg|thumb|upright|Funeral helmet of the [[Pranckh|von Pranckh]] family, 14th century, with the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of two bullhorns.

It is inexpensive, easy to manufacture with even rudimentary equipment (metal scissors, drill, rudimentary anvil, rivets and hammer), and provides good protection for the head against both sharp and blunt weapons. Its biggest drawback is the square edges, that crumple very easily under blunt force trauma, and poor ventilation and air circulation. This can make it very hot in warm weather, although not much heavier, hotter or more cumbersome than a number of other medieval helmet styles.

{"title_page": "Future of the Royal Navy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Royal Navy}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s the [[Royal Navy]] was a force designed for the [[Cold War]]. The main purpose of its fleet, based around three small [[aircraft carrier]]s and a force of [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s, was to search for, and destroy if required, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet submarines]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. The 1982 [[Falklands War]] also demonstrated a requirement for the Royal Navy to maintain a [[Blue-water navy|global reach]] and [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capability]].\n\nSince the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Royal Navy has been used to meet a wider range of objectives around the world, while experiencing a gradual reduction in the size of its surface and submarine fleets. Fixed-wing carrier operations ceased in 2010 with the retirement of the last [[BAE Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]] aircraft. This capability has since been restored by the addition of the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] and the first {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}} which became operational in 2019. Cuts have also seen the sale of three [[Type 23 frigate]]s in 2005 and 2006, and the early decommissioning of four [[Type 22 frigate]]s in 2010 and 2011.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s and the 2000s, the Navy began a series of projects to improve its fleet, with a view to providing enhanced capabilities, although many programmes were reduced in scale. This led to the replacement of smaller and more numerous units with fewer, but larger, units. The main examples of this are the replacement of twelve [[Type 42 destroyer]]s with six [[Type 45 destroyer]]s and the replacement of the three 20,000-tonne {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s with two 65,000-tonne ''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carriers.\n\nAs of October 2019, the following are under construction or being laid down; \n*the final three of seven {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|1}}s, \n*the first of four [[Dreadnought-class submarine|''Dreadnought''-class]] ballistic missile submarines, \n*the first two of eight [[Type 26 frigate]]s and \n*the ninth of nine [[River-class patrol vessel|River-class ocean-going patrol vessels]]. \n\nIn addition, early design and preparation work has begun for a fleet of at least five [[Type 31 frigate]]s.\n\nParliament's National Audit Office (NAO) has described the Ministry of Defence's current equipment plan as \"unaffordable\". With respect to the 2019 to 2029 period, the NAO has noted that the Royal Navy has allocated no funding to replace certain key capabilities, specifically referencing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary hospital ship RFA Argus and the Royal Navy's mine countermeasures capability as examples. <ref>https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Equipment-Plan-2019-to-2029.pdf</ref> These issues are planned to be addressed in the pending integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which had been anticipated in 2020 but, due to Covid-19, is likely to be deferred for at least a year. <ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-new-review-to-define-britains-place-in-the-world</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\n==Ships under construction==\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe following is a list of vessels planned, ordered, under construction or undergoing sea trials within the United Kingdom, and destined for the Royal Navy:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Ship\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Pennant No.\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Builders\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Displacement \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Homeport\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:8%;\"|Commissioning\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |{{sclass-|River|patrol vessel|4}}\n| [[HMS Trent (P224)|''Trent'']] || P224 || rowspan=3|BAE Systems, Glasgow || rowspan=3|2,000 tonnes || rowspan=3|Offshore patrol vessel || rowspan=3|Portsmouth || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adsadvance.co.uk/royal-navy-s-final-opv-named-hms-spey.html||work=ADS Advance|title=Royal Navy's final OPV named HMS Spey|date=7 October 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n|- \n| [[HMS Tamar (P233)|''Tamar'']] || P233 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|-\n| [[HMS Spey (P234)|''Spey'']] || P234 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|- \n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|4}}\n| {{HMS|Audacious|S122|2}} || S122 || rowspan=8|BAE Systems, Barrow-in-Furness || rowspan=4|7,400 tonnes || rowspan=4|Fleet submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected 2021<ref name=\"Delivery\">{{cite web|url=https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/delivery-of-hms-audacious-to-the-royal-navy-delayed-by-another-17-months/|title=Delivery of HMS Audacious to the Royal Navy delayed by another 17 months|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{HMS|Anson|S123|2}} || S123 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agamemnon|S124|2}} || S124 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agincourt|S125|2}} || S125 || Expected 2026<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|4}}\n| ''Dreadnought'' ||  || rowspan=4|17,200 tonnes || rowspan=4|Ballistic missile submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected early 2030s<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n| ''Valiant'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''Warspite'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''King George VI'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n! rowspan=\"8\" | [[Type 26 frigate|''City'' class]]\n| [[HMS Glasgow (Type 26 frigate)|''Glasgow'']] ||  ||rowspan=8| BAE Systems, Glasgow ||rowspan=8| 6,900 tonnes ||rowspan=8| Anti-submarine frigate ||rowspan=8| Devonport|| Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''Cardiff'' ||  || rowspan=7| TBC\n|-\n| ''Belfast'' ||\n|-\n| ''Birmingham'' || \n|-\n| ''Sheffield'' || \n|-\n| ''Newcastle'' || \n|-\n| ''Edinburgh'' ||\n|-\n| ''London'' || \n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Type 31 frigate]]\n| ''TBC'' ||  ||rowspan=5| Babcock International, Rosyth ||rowspan=5| 5,700 tonnes ||rowspan=5| General-purpose frigate ||rowspan=5| || Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/tag/type-31-frigate/</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||  || rowspan=4| TBC\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||\n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|}\n* {{small|''Note: \"[[TBC]]\" means \"[[wikt:TBC|to be confirmed]]\"''}}\n\n==Ships==\n\n===Type 26 and Type 31 frigates===\n{{main|Type 26 frigate|Type 31 frigate}}\n\nIn the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review]] a replacement programme was authorized for the Navy's fleet of thirteen [[Type 23 frigate]]s. In 2012, [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]] was awarded a contract to design the replacement, known as the [[Global Combat Ship|Type 26 Global Combat Ship (GCS)]]. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. According to estimates as of 2020, the first Type 26 frigate is to commission in around 2026/27 and the last commissioning in around 2040, whilst the Type 23s are gradually phased out.<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref> <ref>https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/naval-warfare/fleet-escort-cuts-impending-uks-frigate-maths-fail/</ref>Eight Type 26 frigates will be built initially.

By the latter 2020s and 2030s it is anticipated that numbers may rise again as the replacement vessels enter service. The only way to mitigate this impact would be for currently envisaged retirement dates for the Type 23 to be pushed back. <ref>https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-s-surface-combatant-fleet-set-to-decline-to-15-vessels</ref> The question of how to address this challenge will have to be tackled in the integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which is due in 2020-21 or, due to Covid-19, even later. <ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, BAE revealed two Type 31e designs, namely the Avenger-class and the Cutlass-class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/62246/bae-unveils-general-purpose-frigate-concepts|title=BAE unveils General Purpose Frigate concepts|publisher=IHS Janes|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> Work on the first Type 26 frigate, HMS ''Glasgow'', began in July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1393923-first-of-royal-navy-s-new-frigates-named-hms-glasgow/|title=First of Royal Navy's new frigates named HMS Glasgow|website=STV News|publisher=STV|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref> On 6 September 2017, the UK government committed to building a first batch of five Type 31e frigates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ambitious-future-for-naval-shipbuilding-in-the-uk|title=Ambitious future for Naval Shipbuilding in the UK|date=6 September 2017|website=gov.uk|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> On 26 July 2018 the Government \u2018paused\u2019 the procurement citing the fact that neither of the submissions met the \u00a3250M price point.

The F-35 is a significant improvement over the Harrier, in terms of speed, range and weapon load. The UK had plans to order 138 F-35Bs for the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]]. The financial crisis led to the decision taken in the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]] to immediately withdraw the Harrier GR9 force in late 2010 along with [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], to reduce the total number of F-35s planned for purchase by the UK, and to purchase the F-35C [[CATOBAR]] version rather than the [[STOVL]] F-35B. By May 2012, the government had decided to purchase the short-take off version, the F-35B instead.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/09/government-u-turn-fighter-jets Government forced into U-turn on Royal Navy fighter jets], guardian.co.uk, 10 May 2012</ref> In July 2012, the Secretary of State for Defence stated that an initial 48 F-35Bs will be purchased to equip the carrier fleet.<ref>Hewson, Robert.

The main purpose of its fleet, based around three small [[aircraft carrier]]s and a force of [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s, was to search for, and destroy if required, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet submarines]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. The 1982 [[Falklands War]] also demonstrated a requirement for the Royal Navy to maintain a [[Blue-water navy|global reach]] and [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capability]].\n\nSince the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Royal Navy has been used to meet a wider range of objectives around the world, while experiencing a gradual reduction in the size of its surface and submarine fleets. Fixed-wing carrier operations ceased in 2010 with the retirement of the last [[BAE Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]] aircraft. This capability has since been restored by the addition of the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] and the first {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}} which became operational in 2019. Cuts have also seen the sale of three [[Type 23 frigate]]s in 2005 and 2006, and the early decommissioning of four [[Type 22 frigate]]s in 2010 and 2011.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s and the 2000s, the Navy began a series of projects to improve its fleet, with a view to providing enhanced capabilities, although many programmes were reduced in scale. This led to the replacement of smaller and more numerous units with fewer, but larger, units. The main examples of this are the replacement of twelve [[Type 42 destroyer]]s with six [[Type 45 destroyer]]s and the replacement of the three 20,000-tonne {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s with two 65,000-tonne ''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carriers.\n\nAs of October 2019, the following are under construction or being laid down; \n*the final three of seven {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|1}}s, \n*the first of four [[Dreadnought-class submarine|''Dreadnought''-class]] ballistic missile submarines, \n*the first two of eight [[Type 26 frigate]]s and \n*the ninth of nine [[River-class patrol vessel|River-class ocean-going patrol vessels]]. \n\nIn addition, early design and preparation work has begun for a fleet of at least five [[Type 31 frigate]]s.\n\nParliament's National Audit Office (NAO) has described the Ministry of Defence's current equipment plan as \"unaffordable\". With respect to the 2019 to 2029 period, the NAO has noted that the Royal Navy has allocated no funding to replace certain key capabilities, specifically referencing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary hospital ship RFA Argus and the Royal Navy's mine countermeasures capability as examples. <ref>https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Equipment-Plan-2019-to-2029.pdf</ref> These issues are planned to be addressed in the pending integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which had been anticipated in 2020 but, due to Covid-19, is likely to be deferred for at least a year. <ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-new-review-to-define-britains-place-in-the-world</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\n==Ships under construction==\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe following is a list of vessels planned, ordered, under construction or undergoing sea trials within the United Kingdom, and destined for the Royal Navy:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Ship\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Pennant No.\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Builders\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Displacement \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Homeport\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:8%;\"|Commissioning\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |{{sclass-|River|patrol vessel|3}}\n| [[HMS Trent (P224)|''Trent'']] || P224 || rowspan=3|BAE Systems, Glasgow || rowspan=3|2,000 tonnes || rowspan=3|Offshore patrol vessel || rowspan=3|Portsmouth || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adsadvance.co.uk/royal-navy-s-final-opv-named-hms-spey.html||work=ADS Advance|title=Royal Navy's final OPV named HMS Spey|date=7 October 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n|- \n| [[HMS Tamar (P233)|''Tamar'']] || P233 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|-\n| [[HMS Spey (P234)|''Spey'']] || P234 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|- \n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|4}}\n| {{HMS|Audacious|S122|2}} || S122 || rowspan=8|BAE Systems, Barrow-in-Furness || rowspan=4|7,400 tonnes || rowspan=4|Fleet submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected 2021<ref name=\"Delivery\">{{cite web|url=https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/delivery-of-hms-audacious-to-the-royal-navy-delayed-by-another-17-months/|title=Delivery of HMS Audacious to the Royal Navy delayed by another 17 months|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{HMS|Anson|S123|2}} || S123 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agamemnon|S124|2}} || S124 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agincourt|S125|2}} || S125 || Expected 2026<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|4}}\n| ''Dreadnought'' ||  || rowspan=4|17,200 tonnes || rowspan=4|Ballistic missile submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected early 2030s<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n| ''Valiant'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''Warspite'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''King George VI'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n! rowspan=\"8\" | [[Type 26 frigate|''City'' class]]\n| [[HMS Glasgow (Type 26 frigate)|''Glasgow'']] ||  ||rowspan=8| BAE Systems, Glasgow ||rowspan=8| 6,900 tonnes ||rowspan=8| Anti-submarine frigate ||rowspan=8| Devonport|| Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''Cardiff'' ||  || rowspan=7| TBC\n|-\n| ''Belfast'' ||\n|-\n| ''Birmingham'' || \n|-\n| ''Sheffield'' || \n|-\n| ''Newcastle'' || \n|-\n| ''Edinburgh'' ||\n|-\n| ''London'' || \n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Type 31 frigate]]\n| ''TBC'' ||  ||rowspan=5| Babcock International, Rosyth ||rowspan=5| 5,700 tonnes ||rowspan=5| General-purpose frigate ||rowspan=5| || Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/tag/type-31-frigate/</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||  || rowspan=4| TBC\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||\n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|}\n* {{small|''Note: \"[[TBC]]\" means \"[[wikt:TBC|to be confirmed]]\"''}}\n\n==Ships==\n\n===Type 26 and Type 31 frigates===\n{{main|Type 26 frigate|Type 31 frigate}}\n\nIn the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review]] a replacement programme was authorized for the Navy's fleet of thirteen [[Type 23 frigate]]s. In 2012, [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]] was awarded a contract to design the replacement, known as the [[Global Combat Ship|Type 26 Global Combat Ship (GCS)]]. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. According to estimates as of 2020, the first Type 26 frigate is to commission in around 2026/27 and the last commissioning in around 2040, whilst the Type 23s are gradually phased out.<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref> <ref>https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/naval-warfare/fleet-escort-cuts-impending-uks-frigate-maths-fail/</ref>Eight Type 26 frigates will be built initially.

By the latter 2020s and 2030s it is anticipated that numbers may rise again as the replacement vessels enter service. The only way to mitigate this impact would be for currently envisaged retirement dates for the Type 23 to be pushed back. <ref>https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-s-surface-combatant-fleet-set-to-decline-to-15-vessels</ref> The question of how to address this challenge will have to be tackled in the integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which is due in 2020-21 or, due to Covid-19, even later. <ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, BAE revealed two Type 31e designs, namely the Avenger-class and the Cutlass-class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/62246/bae-unveils-general-purpose-frigate-concepts|title=BAE unveils General Purpose Frigate concepts|publisher=IHS Janes|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> Work on the first Type 26 frigate, HMS ''Glasgow'', began in July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1393923-first-of-royal-navy-s-new-frigates-named-hms-glasgow/|title=First of Royal Navy's new frigates named HMS Glasgow|website=STV News|publisher=STV|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref> On 6 September 2017, the UK government committed to building a first batch of five Type 31e frigates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ambitious-future-for-naval-shipbuilding-in-the-uk|title=Ambitious future for Naval Shipbuilding in the UK|date=6 September 2017|website=gov.uk|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> On 26 July 2018 the Government \u2018paused\u2019 the procurement citing the fact that neither of the submissions met the \u00a3250M price point.

The larger the air group, the more tasks it can perform. The ''Invincible'' class, because of its small size, had only a limited capacity, and was only capable of operating STOVL aircraft, the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]]. In 2006 the [[Sea Harrier]] was withdrawn from service.

The Harrier's replacement in both the RAF and the FAA is the [[F-35 Lightning II]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]]. The F-35 is a significant improvement over the Harrier, in terms of speed, range and weapon load. The UK had plans to order 138 F-35Bs for the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]]. The financial crisis led to the decision taken in the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]] to immediately withdraw the Harrier GR9 force in late 2010 along with [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], to reduce the total number of F-35s planned for purchase by the UK, and to purchase the F-35C [[CATOBAR]] version rather than the [[STOVL]] F-35B.

Japan's first recognised [[Chinatown]] was in Nagasaki, developing in the 1680s when economic prerogatives meant that the Shogunal government needed to restrict and control trade to a greater extent than previously. Before this, there had been a large number of Chinese communities in the west of the country, made up of pirates, merchants and also people who fitted into both categories{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. In the 19th century, the well-known Chinatowns of [[Yokohama]] and [[Kobe]] developed, and they are still thriving today, although the majority of Chinese people in Japan live outside Chinatowns in the regular community. The communities are served by Chinese schools that teach the [[Chinese language]], and a small but increasing number of Japanese people study Chinese in both public schools and private academies.\n\nThe Chinese community has undergone a dramatic change since the PRC allowed more freedom of movement of its citizens, but citizens of Taiwan (ROC), Singapore and Hong Kong nationality are not counted in these figures. A study that was conducted in 1995 estimated that the Chinese population of Japan numbered 150,000, among whom between 50,000 and 100,000 could speak Chinese.{{sfn|Maher|1995|pp=125\u2013138}} In 2000, Japanese governmental statistics revealed that there were 335,575 Chinese people in Japan.{{sfn|Refsing|2003|pp=48\u221263}} Current demographic statistics reveal that these numbers have reached over 600,000 legal immigrants, although there is probably also a significant population, although of unknown number, of illegal immigrants{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. A significant number of Chinese people take Japanese citizenship each year and therefore disappear from these figures. As Japanese citizenship, like France, does not record ethnicity, once a person has naturalised, they are simply Japanese, so the category of Chinese-Japanese does not exist in the same way as it would in a country which recognises ethnicity. Therefore, the numbers of Japanese people who are of Chinese descent is unclear.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-modern era ===\nThe original immigrants to the Japanese isles probably came from the south, but around 2300 years ago, increasing numbers came from what is now China and Korea. These were not all nameless, a [[Chinese legend]] of uncertain provenance states that [[Xu Fu]], a [[Qin Dynasty]] court sorcerer, was sent by [[Qin Shi Huang]] to [[Penglai Mountain]] ([[Mount Fuji]]) in 219 BC to retrieve an [[elixir of life]]. Xu could not find any [[elixir of life]] and was reluctant to return to China because he knew he would be sentenced to death, Xu instead stayed in Japan.<ref name=CRI>{{cite web|title=Why did Xu Fu go to Japan?|work=China Radio International|date=18 February 2005|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1702/2005-2-18/14@207573.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508001542/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1702/2005-2-18/14%40207573.htm|archivedate=8 May 2005|accessdate=25 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other immigrants are also thought to include major population movements such as that of the [[Hata clan]].\n\nHowever, Japan's first verifiable Chinese visitor was the [[Buddhist]] missionary [[Hui Shen]], whose 499 AD visit to an island east of [[China]] known as [[Fusang]], typically identified with modern-day Japan, was described in the 7th-century ''[[Book of Liang|Liang Shu]]''.\n\nAccording to the [[Shinsen Sh\u014djiroku]] (815), 176 Chinese aristocratic families lived in Japan.{{sfn|Schottenhammer|2012|p=71}}\n\nChinese people are also known to have settled in [[Okinawa]] during the [[Sanzan period]] at the invitation of the Ryukyuan kings; these were high level royal advisors who lived in the village of [[Kumemura]], for example, claim to all be descended from Chinese immigrants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=76}}\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Yokohama Chinatown temple.jpg|thumb|right|Kanteibyou Temple in [[Yokohama Chinatown]]]]\nDuring the Meiji and Taisho eras, it is estimated that up to 100 000 Chinese students came to study in Japan.

After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese.

Japan's first recognised [[Chinatown]] was in Nagasaki, developing in the 1680s when economic prerogatives meant that the Shogunal government needed to restrict and control trade to a greater extent than previously. Before this, there had been a large number of Chinese communities in the west of the country, made up of pirates, merchants and also people who fitted into both categories{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. In the 19th century, the well-known Chinatowns of [[Yokohama]] and [[Kobe]] developed, and they are still thriving today, although the majority of Chinese people in Japan live outside Chinatowns in the regular community. The communities are served by Chinese schools that teach the [[Chinese language]], and a small but increasing number of Japanese people study Chinese in both public schools and private academies.\n\nThe Chinese community has undergone a dramatic change since the PRC allowed more freedom of movement of its citizens, but citizens of Taiwan (ROC), Singapore and Hong Kong nationality are not counted in these figures. A study that was conducted in 1995 estimated that the Chinese population of Japan numbered 150,000, among whom between 50,000 and 100,000 could speak Chinese.{{sfn|Maher|1995|pp=125\u2013138}} In 2000, Japanese governmental statistics revealed that there were 335,575 Chinese people in Japan.{{sfn|Refsing|2003|pp=48\u221263}} Current demographic statistics reveal that these numbers have reached over 600,000 legal immigrants, although there is probably also a significant population, although of unknown number, of illegal immigrants{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. A significant number of Chinese people take Japanese citizenship each year and therefore disappear from these figures. As Japanese citizenship, like France, does not record ethnicity, once a person has naturalised, they are simply Japanese, so the category of Chinese-Japanese does not exist in the same way as it would in a country which recognises ethnicity. Therefore, the numbers of Japanese people who are of Chinese descent is unclear.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-modern era ===\nThe original immigrants to the Japanese isles probably came from the south, but around 2300 years ago, increasing numbers came from what is now China and Korea. These were not all nameless, a [[Chinese legend]] of uncertain provenance states that [[Xu Fu]], a [[Qin Dynasty]] court sorcerer, was sent by [[Qin Shi Huang]] to [[Penglai Mountain]] ([[Mount Fuji]]) in 219 BC to retrieve an [[elixir of life]]. Xu could not find any [[elixir of life]] and was reluctant to return to China because he knew he would be sentenced to death, Xu instead stayed in Japan.<ref name=CRI>{{cite web|title=Why did Xu Fu go to Japan?|work=China Radio International|date=18 February 2005|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1702/2005-2-18/14@207573.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508001542/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1702/2005-2-18/14%40207573.htm|archivedate=8 May 2005|accessdate=25 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other immigrants are also thought to include major population movements such as that of the [[Hata clan]].\n\nHowever, Japan's first verifiable Chinese visitor was the [[Buddhist]] missionary [[Hui Shen]], whose 499 AD visit to an island east of [[China]] known as [[Fusang]], typically identified with modern-day Japan, was described in the 7th-century ''[[Book of Liang|Liang Shu]]''.\n\nAccording to the [[Shinsen Sh\u014djiroku]] (815), 176 Chinese aristocratic families lived in Japan.{{sfn|Schottenhammer|2012|p=71}}\n\nChinese people are also known to have settled in [[Okinawa]] during the [[Sanzan period]] at the invitation of the Ryukyuan kings; these were high level royal advisors who lived in the village of [[Kumemura]], for example, claim to all be descended from Chinese immigrants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=76}}\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Yokohama Chinatown temple.jpg|thumb|right|Kanteibyou Temple in [[Yokohama Chinatown]]]]\nDuring the Meiji and Taisho eras, it is estimated that up to 100 000 Chinese students came to study in Japan.

After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.\n\n... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word.

This can be skipped by obtaining a commercially available library. 2. Screen: Cells are transduced with lentiviral particles containing the sgRNA library, Cas9, and other necessary components. Cells may be transduced in bulk (pooled screen), or in individual wells (arrayed screen). 3: Measurement & Analysis. Desired clones are selected and DNA is extracted. In a pooled screen, DNA sequencing will be necessary. sgRNAs are recovered, analysed, and associated genes identified.|alt=|border|thumb|692x692px]]\n\n== History ==\n\nEarly studies in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''<ref name=\"pmid4366476\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner S | title = The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Genetics | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u201394 | date = May 1974 | pmid = 4366476 | pmc = 1213120 | doi =  }}</ref> and ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''<ref name=\"pmid814037\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gans M, Audit C, Masson M | title = Isolation and characterization of sex-linked female-sterile mutants in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Genetics | volume = 81 | issue = 4 | pages = 683\u2013704 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 814037 | pmc = 1213428 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid6776413\">{{cite journal | vauthors = N\u00fcsslein-Volhard C, Wieschaus E | title = Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5785 | pages = 795\u2013801 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 6776413 | doi = 10.1038/287795a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..795N }}</ref> saw large-scale, systematic loss of function (LOF) screens performed through [[saturation mutagenesis]], demonstrating the potential of this approach to characterise genetic pathways and identify genes with unique and essential functions.

Less stringent cut-offs are used for hit selection, and additional sgRNAs are later used in a more specific secondary screen. This approach is demonstrated by Doench ''et al''. (2016),<ref name=\"Doench_2016\"/> who found that >92% of genes recovered using the standard protocol were also recovered using fewer sgRNAs per gene. They suggest that this strategy could be useful in studies where scale-up is prohibitively costly.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Lentiviral limitations ===\n\nLentiviral vectors have certain general limitations. For one, it is impossible to control where the viral genome integrates into the host genome, and this may affect important functions of the cell. Vannucci ''et al.''<ref name=\"pmid23435812\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vannucci L, Lai M, Chiuppesi F, Ceccherini-Nelli L, Pistello M | title = Viral vectors: a look back and ahead on gene transfer technology | journal = The New Microbiologica | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201322 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23435812 | doi =  }}</ref> provide an excellent review of viral vectors along with their general advantages and disadvantages. In the specific context of genome-wide CRISPR screens, producing and transducing the lentiviral particles is relatively laborious and time consuming, taking about two weeks in total.<ref name=\"takara\"/> Additionally, because the DNA integrates into the host genome, lentiviral delivery leads to long-term expression of Cas9, potentially leading to off-target effects.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Arrayed vs pooled screens ===\nIn an arrayed screen, each well contains a specific and known sgRNA targeting a specific gene. Arrayed screens therefore allow for detailed profiling of a single cell, but are limited by high costs and the labour required to isolate and culture the high number of individual cell populations.<ref name=\"Agrotis_2015\"/> Conventional pooled CRISPR screens are relatively simple and cost effective to perform, but are limited to the study of the entire cell population. This means that rare phenotypes may be more difficult to identify, and only crude phenotypes can be selected for e.g. cell survival, proliferation, or reporter gene expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Future Directions==\n\n=== CRISPR + single cell RNA-seq ===\n\nEmerging technologies are aiming to combine pooled CRISPR screens with the detailed resolution of massively parallel [[RNA-Seq#Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq)|single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)]].

For a review of CRISPR limitations see Lino et al. (2018)<ref name=\"Lino_2018\" />''\n\n=== The sgRNA library ===\n\nGenome-wide CRISPR screens will ultimately be limited by the properties of the chosen sgRNA library. Each library will contain a different set of sgRNAs, and average coverage per gene may vary. Currently available libraries tend to be biased towards sgRNAs targeting early (5\u2019) protein-coding exons, rather than those targeting the more functional protein domains.<ref name=\"Hinze_2019\"/> This problem was highlighted by Hinze ''et al.'' (2019),<ref name=\"Hinze_2019\"/> who noted that genes associated with [[asparaginase]] sensitivity failed to score in their genome-wide screen of asparaginase-resistant leukemia cells.\n\nIf an appropriate library is not available, creating and amplifying a new sgRNA library is a lengthy process which may take many months. Potential challenges include: (i) effective sgRNA design; (ii) ensuring comprehensive sgRNA coverage throughout the genome; (iii) lentiviral vector backbone design; (iv) producing sufficient amounts of high-quality lentivirus; (v) overcoming low transformation efficiency; (vi) proper scaling of the bacterial culture.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Quinn T | title = Advantages and challenges of pooled libraries | work = Webinar series | publisher = Takara Bio USA | url = https://www.takarabio.com/learning-centers/gene-function/gene-editing/genome-wide-screening/crispr-library-screening-webinar }}</ref>\n\n=== Maintaining cellular sgRNA coverage ===\n\nOne of the largest hurdles for genome-wide CRISPR screening is ensuring adequate coverage of the sgRNA library across the cell population.<ref name=\"Yau_2018\" /> Evidence so far has suggested that each sgRNA should be represented and maintained in a minimum of 200-300 cells.<ref name=\"Yau_2018\" /><ref name=\"Hart_2015\" /> \n\nConsidering that the standard protocol uses a multiplicity of infection of ~0.3, and a transduction efficiency of 30-40%<ref name=\"takara\"/><ref name=\"Yau_2018\"/> the number of cells required to produce and maintain suitable coverage becomes very large. By way of example, the most popular human sgRNA library is the [https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1-3yBRCmARIsAN7B4H2cTsJq44UZen4GOpdr-IbSGuTdqS_BjcCdi9x0PtthkDXvoIztPDgaAoNIEALw_wcB/ GeCKO v2 library] created by the Zhang lab;<ref name=\"Zhang_2014\"/> it contains 123,411 sgRNAs.

Less stringent cut-offs are used for hit selection, and additional sgRNAs are later used in a more specific secondary screen. This approach is demonstrated by Doench ''et al''. (2016),<ref name=\"Doench_2016\"/> who found that >92% of genes recovered using the standard protocol were also recovered using fewer sgRNAs per gene. They suggest that this strategy could be useful in studies where scale-up is prohibitively costly.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Lentiviral limitations ===\n\nLentiviral vectors have certain general limitations. For one, it is impossible to control where the viral genome integrates into the host genome, and this may affect important functions of the cell. Vannucci ''et al.''<ref name=\"pmid23435812\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vannucci L, Lai M, Chiuppesi F, Ceccherini-Nelli L, Pistello M | title = Viral vectors: a look back and ahead on gene transfer technology | journal = The New Microbiologica | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201322 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23435812 | doi =  }}</ref> provide an excellent review of viral vectors along with their general advantages and disadvantages. In the specific context of genome-wide CRISPR screens, producing and transducing the lentiviral particles is relatively laborious and time consuming, taking about two weeks in total.<ref name=\"takara\"/> Additionally, because the DNA integrates into the host genome, lentiviral delivery leads to long-term expression of Cas9, potentially leading to off-target effects.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Arrayed vs pooled screens ===\nIn an arrayed screen, each well contains a specific and known sgRNA targeting a specific gene. Arrayed screens therefore allow for detailed profiling of a single cell, but are limited by high costs and the labour required to isolate and culture the high number of individual cell populations.<ref name=\"Agrotis_2015\"/> Conventional pooled CRISPR screens are relatively simple and cost effective to perform, but are limited to the study of the entire cell population. This means that rare phenotypes may be more difficult to identify, and only crude phenotypes can be selected for e.g. cell survival, proliferation, or reporter gene expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Future Directions==\n\n=== CRISPR + single cell RNA-seq ===\n\nEmerging technologies are aiming to combine pooled CRISPR screens with the detailed resolution of massively parallel [[RNA-Seq#Single-cell_RNA_sequencing_(scRNA-Seq)|single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)]].

In 1994 the name was changed to Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Buthelezi used a structure rooted in ''Inkatha'' (meaning \"crown\" in Zulu), a 1920s cultural organisation for [[Zulu people|Zulus]] established by his uncle Zulu King [[Solomon kaDinuzulu]]. The party was established in what is now [[KwaZulu-Natal]], after which branches of the party quickly sprang up in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], the [[Orange Free State Province|Orange Free State]] and the [[Western Cape]].\n\nBecause of Buthelezi's former position in the [[African National Congress]], the two organisations were initially very close and each supported the other in the anti-apartheid struggle. However, by the early 1980s the Inkatha had come to be regarded as a thorn in the side of the ANC, which wielded much more political force through the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front (UDF)]], than Inkatha and the [[Pan Africanist Congress]]. Although the Inkatha leadership initially favoured non-violence, there is clear evidence that during the time that negotiations were taking place in the early 1990s, Inkatha and ANC members were at war with each other, and ''Self-Protection Units (SPUs)'' and ''Self-Defence Units (SDUs)'' were formed, respectively, as their protection forces.\n\nAs a Homeland leader, the power of Buthelezi depended on the South African state and economy. With anti-apartheid leaders inside South Africa and abroad demanding sanctions, Buthelezi came to be regarded more and more as a government puppet, along with other Bantustan leaders. His tribal loyalties and focus on ethnic interests over national unity were also criticised as contributing to the divisive programme of Inkatha. This led to a virtual civil war between Zulu loyalist supporters and ANC members in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nFearing an erosion of his power, Buthelezi collaborated with the [[South African Defence Force]] and received military training for Zulu militia from SADF special forces starting in the 1980s as part of [[Operation Marion]]. Inkatha members were involved in several massacres in the run-up to South Africa's first democratic elections, including the [[Trust Feed massacre]] on December 3, 1988 and the [[Boipatong massacre]] on June 17, 1992. <ref>[http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/85967 Zuma and Zulu nationalism: A response to Gumede] pambazuka.org</ref>\n\nDuring the phase of establishing a constitution for South Africa and prior to the first free elections in South African history, bloodshed frequently occurred between Inkatha and the ANC. Both Inkatha and ANC attempted to campaign in each other's KwaZulu-Natal strongholds, and were met with resistance, sometimes violent, by members of the opposing party. Inkatha was also initially opposed to parts of the proposed South African constitution regarding the internal politics of KwaZulu, and, in particular, they campaigned for an autonomous and sovereign Zulu king, (King [[Goodwill Zwelethini kaBhekuzulu]]), as head of state. As a result, Inkatha abstained from registering its party for the 1994 election (a necessity in order to receive votes), in opposition. However, once it became obvious that its efforts were not going to stop the election (Inkatha desired goal), the party was registered as the Inkatha Freedom Party at the eleventh hour. However, due to their opposition to the constitution, concessions were made and KwaZulu-Natal (and thus all the other provinces) were granted double ballots for provincial and national legislatures, greater provincial powers, the inclusion of '[[KwaZulu]]' in the official name of the province (formerly '[[Natal Province|Natal]]') and recognition of specific ethnic and tribal groups within the province.\n\nOn election day, the IFP displayed its political strength by taking the majority of the votes for [[KwaZulu-Natal]].\n\n=== Post-apartheid politics ===\nAfter the dismantling of apartheid system in 1994, the IFP formed an uneasy coalition in the national government with their traditional political rival, the ANC. This coalition was to last until 2004, when the IFP joined the opposition benches.\n\nThe ANC/IFP rivalry, characterised by sporadic acts of [[political violence]], has been firm since 1993. In 2004, while campaigning in Vulindlela, an IFP bastion in the [[Pietermaritzburg]] [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands|Midlands]] region, [[Thabo Mbeki]] was reportedly debarred by an IFP-affiliated traditional leader in Mafunze. Previously the stronghold of [[Moses Mabhida]], this area has long been the site of heated clashes between the parties.<ref>Olifant and Khumalo 2009.</ref>\n\nThe IFP's manifesto seeks the resolution to a number of South African issues, especially the [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|AIDS]] crisis, in addition to addressing \"unemployment, crime, poverty and corruption and prevent the consolidation of a one-party state\"<ref>[http://www.ifp.org.za/ IFP official website]</ref> The \"prevention of a one-party state\" is with regards to the ruling ANC, which is perceived by many{{who?|date=August 2019}} as making efforts to undemocratically consolidate power for their own party. The IFP also states that \"Our proposals are designed to give people control over their lives: a hand up, not a hand down. Social justice for all. We also have the political will to deal effectively with these problems.\"\n\n=== Gavin Woods report===\n[[Gavin Woods (politician)|Gavin Woods]], one of the party's most respected MPs, drew up a highly critical 11 page internal discussion document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1750778,00.html|title=IFP has 'no mission, no vision'|accessdate=18 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221112350/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1750778,00.html|archivedate=21 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> at the request of the parliamentary caucus after a discussion in October 2004. In it he said that the IFP \"has no discernible vision, mission or philosophical base, no clear national ambitions or direction, no articulated ideological basis and offers little in the way of current, vibrant original and relevant policies\". Woods also warned the party that \"it must treat Buthelezi as the leader of a political party and not the political party itself\". Woods pinpointed 1987 as the year when the IFP started losing ground as a political force. Before 1987, Woods contends, the party had a strong, unambiguous national identity. He further criticized the IFP's inability to end the ANC's campaign of violence against it, and an \"impotent\" attitude towards the attacks conducted against it by the ANC.\n\nAt the first caucus discussion, Woods read out the 11-page paper in full and caucus members were generally positive about its frank nature. IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi was absent from that meeting but raised it at a meeting of the party's national council, which Woods did not attend. At a subsequent caucus meeting where both were present, [[Buthelezi]] read from a prepared statement attacking Woods.

In 1994 the name was changed to Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Buthelezi used a structure rooted in ''Inkatha'' (meaning \"crown\" in Zulu), a 1920s cultural organisation for [[Zulu people|Zulus]] established by his uncle Zulu King [[Solomon kaDinuzulu]]. The party was established in what is now [[KwaZulu-Natal]], after which branches of the party quickly sprang up in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], the [[Orange Free State Province|Orange Free State]] and the [[Western Cape]].\n\nBecause of Buthelezi's former position in the [[African National Congress]], the two organisations were initially very close and each supported the other in the anti-apartheid struggle. However, by the early 1980s the Inkatha had come to be regarded as a thorn in the side of the ANC, which wielded much more political force through the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front (UDF)]], than Inkatha and the [[Pan Africanist Congress]]. Although the Inkatha leadership initially favoured non-violence, there is clear evidence that during the time that negotiations were taking place in the early 1990s, Inkatha and ANC members were at war with each other, and ''Self-Protection Units (SPUs)'' and ''Self-Defence Units (SDUs)'' were formed, respectively, as their protection forces.\n\nAs a Homeland leader, the power of Buthelezi depended on the South African state and economy. With anti-apartheid leaders inside South Africa and abroad demanding sanctions, Buthelezi came to be regarded more and more as a government puppet, along with other Bantustan leaders. His tribal loyalties and focus on ethnic interests over national unity were also criticised as contributing to the divisive programme of Inkatha. This led to a virtual civil war between Zulu loyalist supporters and ANC members in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nFearing an erosion of his power, Buthelezi collaborated with the [[South African Defence Force]] and received military training for Zulu militia from SADF special forces starting in the 1980s as part of [[Operation Marion]]. Inkatha members were involved in several massacres in the run-up to South Africa's first democratic elections, including the [[Trust Feed massacre]] on December 3, 1988 and the [[Boipatong massacre]] on June 17, 1992. <ref>[http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/85967 Zuma and Zulu nationalism: A response to Gumede] pambazuka.org</ref>\n\nDuring the phase of establishing a constitution for South Africa and prior to the first free elections in South African history, bloodshed frequently occurred between Inkatha and the ANC. Both Inkatha and ANC attempted to campaign in each other's KwaZulu-Natal strongholds, and were met with resistance, sometimes violent, by members of the opposing party. Inkatha was also initially opposed to parts of the proposed South African constitution regarding the internal politics of KwaZulu, and, in particular, they campaigned for an autonomous and sovereign Zulu king, (King [[Goodwill Zwelethini kaBhekuzulu]]), as head of state. As a result, Inkatha abstained from registering its party for the 1994 election (a necessity in order to receive votes), in opposition. However, once it became obvious that its efforts were not going to stop the election (Inkatha desired goal), the party was registered as the Inkatha Freedom Party at the eleventh hour. However, due to their opposition to the constitution, concessions were made and KwaZulu-Natal (and thus all the other provinces) were granted double ballots for provincial and national legislatures, greater provincial powers, the inclusion of '[[KwaZulu]]' in the official name of the province (formerly '[[Natal Province|Natal]]') and recognition of specific ethnic and tribal groups within the province.\n\nOn election day, the IFP displayed its political strength by taking the majority of the votes for [[KwaZulu-Natal]].\n\n=== Post-apartheid politics ===\nAfter the dismantling of apartheid system in 1994, the IFP formed an uneasy coalition in the national government with their traditional political rival, the ANC. This coalition was to last until 2004, when the IFP joined the opposition benches.\n\nThe ANC/IFP rivalry, characterised by sporadic acts of [[political violence]], has been firm since 1993. In 2004, while campaigning in Vulindlela, an IFP bastion in the [[Pietermaritzburg]] [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands|Midlands]] region, [[Thabo Mbeki]] was reportedly debarred by an IFP-affiliated traditional leader in Mafunze. Previously the stronghold of [[Moses Mabhida]], this area has long been the site of heated clashes between the parties.<ref>Olifant and Khumalo 2009.</ref>\n\nThe IFP's manifesto seeks the resolution to a number of South African issues, especially the [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|AIDS]] crisis, in addition to addressing \"unemployment, crime, poverty and corruption and prevent the consolidation of a one-party state\"<ref>[http://www.ifp.org.za/ IFP official website]</ref> The \"prevention of a one-party state\" is with regards to the ruling ANC, which is perceived by many{{who?|date=August 2019}} as making efforts to undemocratically consolidate power for their own party. The IFP also states that \"Our proposals are designed to give people control over their lives: a hand up, not a hand down. Social justice for all. We also have the political will to deal effectively with these problems.\"\n\n=== Gavin Woods report===\n[[Gavin Woods (politician)|Gavin Woods]], one of the party's most respected MPs, drew up a highly critical 11 page internal discussion document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1750778,00.html|title=IFP has 'no mission, no vision'|accessdate=18 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221112350/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1750778,00.html|archivedate=21 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> at the request of the parliamentary caucus after a discussion in October 2004. In it he said that the IFP \"has no discernible vision, mission or philosophical base, no clear national ambitions or direction, no articulated ideological basis and offers little in the way of current, vibrant original and relevant policies\". Woods also warned the party that \"it must treat Buthelezi as the leader of a political party and not the political party itself\". Woods pinpointed 1987 as the year when the IFP started losing ground as a political force. Before 1987, Woods contends, the party had a strong, unambiguous national identity. He further criticized the IFP's inability to end the ANC's campaign of violence against it, and an \"impotent\" attitude towards the attacks conducted against it by the ANC.\n\nAt the first caucus discussion, Woods read out the 11-page paper in full and caucus members were generally positive about its frank nature. IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi was absent from that meeting but raised it at a meeting of the party's national council, which Woods did not attend. At a subsequent caucus meeting where both were present, [[Buthelezi]] read from a prepared statement attacking Woods. All the numbered copies were ordered to be \"shredded\" but some survived.\n===Electoral decline===\nAfter the 1994 elections, the IFP suffered a gradual decline in support. The party ceded control of the [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal province]] to the ANC following the [[2004 South African general election|2004 general election]] and its presence in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, its stronghold, started to become diminished.<ref>{{cite news |title=The IFP is on the verge of being extinct |url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2009-05-19-the-ifp-is-on-the-verge-of-being-extinct/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |newspaper=SowetanLIVE |date=19 May 2009}}</ref> Party member Ziba Jiyane left the IFP to form the [[National Democratic Convention (South Africa)|National Democratic Convention]] (Nadeco).

Buthelezi had previously announced his retirement but rescinded it.

The party lost its status as the official opposition in the [[KwaZulu-Natal Legislature]] to the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]].

The ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]] of Melbourne, which itself owned and operated other similarly named 'sixty-milers' (''Mortlake Bank, Pelton Bank and Hetton Bank''). R.W. Miller not only chartered ships like the ''Hexham Bank'' but also owned its own ships such as the ''Birchgrove Park''. \n\nThe southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most of these were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Some coal merchants, such as Jones Brothers' Coal, owned their own ships<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16419057|title=COAL TRADE.|date=1927-11-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2020-03-22|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nShips of course were bought and sold, and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners.Sometimes, a change in ownership also resulted in a ship's name changing, such as when ''Corrimal'' was renamed ''Ayrfield'' or when ''South Bulli'' became ''Abersea''.<ref name=\":26\" /> There were many owners up to the middle of 20th-Century, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. These complexities, together with the cross-ownership, mergers and takeovers that took place in the coal and coastal shipping companies, sometimes makes it hard to follow the owners and operators of particular vessels.\n\n=== Operation and crewing ===\nDue to the short distances between Sydney and the coal ports, and for commercial reasons, the 'sixty-milers' made frequent trips of short duration, carrying coal to Sydney and in ballast for the return trip.\n\nThe coal cargo was stored in the holds in bulk and needed to be \"trimmed\" to ensure that its distribution did not result in a list to one side or the other. Typically, trimming was done by the ship's crew, although depending on the sophistication of the loading arrangements coal was loaded in such a way as to minimise the need for trimming.\n\nThe ships could be loaded relatively quickly<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15099181|title=RECORD COAL LOADING.|date=1909-07-10|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-09-23|pages=13}}</ref> and be at sea in time to complete the trip to Sydney from Newcastle in six or so hours;<ref name=\":18\" /> it would take longer in bad weather. Operation of the 'sixty-milers' was typically six-days per week and around the clock.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nA crew of 10 to 16 was typical, depending upon the size of the ship. A crew of a 'sixty-miler' (1919) would include a master, two mates, two engineers, a donkeyman, two firemen, four to six seamen, a cook and a steward.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Incidents, losses and inquiries ==\nOver the years of the coastal coal-carrying trade, many 'sixty-milers' were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. A common factor in most of the losses of 'sixty milers' was bad weather. In some losses, a factor seemed to be a haste to put to sea and get the cargo to Sydney. Another factor was the use of ocean jetties at some coal loading ports.\n\n=== Hazards of ocean jetties ===\n[[File:Coalcliff Jetty (4903254981).jpg|thumb|286x286px|[[Coalcliff#History#Coal Mine and Jetty|Coalcliff Jetty]] - the smallest and most exposed of the ocean jetties<ref name=\"1934- 1984 2\"/> (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, [[Powerhouse Museum]])]]\nThe waters in which the ocean jetties were located were in nautical parlance called \"open roadsteads\", meaning \"an area near the shore where vessels anchor with relatively little protection from the sea.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/open+roadstead|title=open roadstead|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Ocean jetties typically were  located so as to have some natural protection from the south, against the common \"[[southerly buster]]\". While somewhat protected from the south, all the ocean jetties were exposed to the \"[[black nor'easter]]\", a violent storm that can arise quickly.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rocky reefs that provided protection from one direction would themselves become a hazard,when the weather was from the opposite direction.\n\nThe loading operation at an ocean jetty itself could be hazardous. In the days before moveable loaders, the ship needed to be repositioned under the fixed loading chutes, either to change hatches or to reduce the amount of trimming needed. All this, while in shallow water and close to a rocky shore or beach, made working the jetty ports hazardous.\n\nOcean jetty ports were more hazardous for sailing vessels than for the more manoeverable steamships. Yet, in the earlier years of the coastal trade, coal was mainly shipped on sailing vessels. The perils of these operations were shown by the events of the night of 7 September 1867, when two [[barque]]s\u2014''Matador'' and ''Bright Planet''\u2014were blown ashore and wrecked at [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13158007|title=WRECKS.|date=1867-09-21|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60844651|title=DISASTERS AT BULLI.|date=1867-09-10|work=Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=4}}</ref>  \n[[File:Wallarah Jetty, Catherine Hill Bay (6809552821).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay]], with a small 'sixty-miler' alongside.

The ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]] of Melbourne, which itself owned and operated other similarly named 'sixty-milers' (''Mortlake Bank, Pelton Bank and Hetton Bank''). R.W. Miller not only chartered ships like the ''Hexham Bank'' but also owned its own ships such as the ''Birchgrove Park''. \n\nThe southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most of these were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Some coal merchants, such as Jones Brothers' Coal, owned their own ships<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16419057|title=COAL TRADE.|date=1927-11-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2020-03-22|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nShips of course were bought and sold, and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners.Sometimes, a change in ownership also resulted in a ship's name changing, such as when ''Corrimal'' was renamed ''Ayrfield'' or when ''South Bulli'' became ''Abersea''.<ref name=\":26\" /> There were many owners up to the middle of 20th-Century, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. These complexities, together with the cross-ownership, mergers and takeovers that took place in the coal and coastal shipping companies, sometimes makes it hard to follow the owners and operators of particular vessels.\n\n=== Operation and crewing ===\nDue to the short distances between Sydney and the coal ports, and for commercial reasons, the 'sixty-milers' made frequent trips of short duration, carrying coal to Sydney and in ballast for the return trip.\n\nThe coal cargo was stored in the holds in bulk and needed to be \"trimmed\" to ensure that its distribution did not result in a list to one side or the other. Typically, trimming was done by the ship's crew, although depending on the sophistication of the loading arrangements coal was loaded in such a way as to minimise the need for trimming.\n\nThe ships could be loaded relatively quickly<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15099181|title=RECORD COAL LOADING.|date=1909-07-10|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-09-23|pages=13}}</ref> and be at sea in time to complete the trip to Sydney from Newcastle in six or so hours;<ref name=\":18\" /> it would take longer in bad weather. Operation of the 'sixty-milers' was typically six-days per week and around the clock.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nA crew of 10 to 16 was typical, depending upon the size of the ship. A crew of a 'sixty-miler' (1919) would include a master, two mates, two engineers, a donkeyman, two firemen, four to six seamen, a cook and a steward.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Incidents, losses and inquiries ==\nOver the years of the coastal coal-carrying trade, many 'sixty-milers' were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. A common factor in most of the losses of 'sixty milers' was bad weather. In some losses, a factor seemed to be a haste to put to sea and get the cargo to Sydney. Another factor was the use of ocean jetties at some coal loading ports.\n\n=== Hazards of ocean jetties ===\n[[File:Coalcliff Jetty (4903254981).jpg|thumb|286x286px|[[Coalcliff#History#Coal Mine and Jetty|Coalcliff Jetty]] - the smallest and most exposed of the ocean jetties<ref name=\"1934- 1984 2\"/> (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, [[Powerhouse Museum]])]]\nThe waters in which the ocean jetties were located were in nautical parlance called \"open roadsteads\", meaning \"an area near the shore where vessels anchor with relatively little protection from the sea.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/open+roadstead|title=open roadstead|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Ocean jetties typically were  located so as to have some natural protection from the south, against the common \"[[southerly buster]]\". While somewhat protected from the south, all the ocean jetties were exposed to the \"[[black nor'easter]]\", a violent storm that can arise quickly.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rocky reefs that provided protection from one direction would themselves become a hazard,when the weather was from the opposite direction.\n\nThe loading operation at an ocean jetty itself could be hazardous. In the days before moveable loaders, the ship needed to be repositioned under the fixed loading chutes, either to change hatches or to reduce the amount of trimming needed. All this, while in shallow water and close to a rocky shore or beach, made working the jetty ports hazardous.\n\nOcean jetty ports were more hazardous for sailing vessels than for the more manoeverable steamships. Yet, in the earlier years of the coastal trade, coal was mainly shipped on sailing vessels. The perils of these operations were shown by the events of the night of 7 September 1867, when two [[barque]]s\u2014''Matador'' and ''Bright Planet''\u2014were blown ashore and wrecked at [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13158007|title=WRECKS.|date=1867-09-21|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60844651|title=DISASTERS AT BULLI.|date=1867-09-10|work=Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=4}}</ref>  \n[[File:Wallarah Jetty, Catherine Hill Bay (6809552821).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay]], with a small 'sixty-miler' alongside.

The ''Undola'' had sailed from Bellambi and the ''Tuggerah'' from [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli]], both ocean jetty ports at which inspections never took place.

Miller,'' her sister ship the ''Birchgrove Park'', served from 1931 until she became the last 'sixty-miler' to founder in 1956. Only four of the fourteen crew of the ''Birchgrove Park'' survived. They told of how Captain Laurence Lynch had refused to seek the shelter of [[Broken Bay]] during a storm but had pressed on, toward Sydney, before the vessel foundered off the northern beaches of Sydney. The survivors also told how the pumps were not started until there was too much free water in the hold, leaking in from a damaged part of the aged ship. The survivors also told of how the ship's radio aerial was not in place, and they had to use their signal lamp to contact the [[Macquarie Lighthouse|South Head Lighthouse]] when the ship was in distress. This absence of radio contact and the search being made too far south of the ship's last location led to a greater loss of life than otherwise might have been the case. The loss of the ''Birchgrove Park'' forms a part of the narrative of a book\u2014\"The Sixty-Miler\"\u2014written by Norma Sim, the widow of Bill Sim, one men lost with the ''Birchgrove Park''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4351846|title=The sixty miler: a story of love and the sea|last=Sim|first=Norma|date=2008|publisher=Pier 9|isbn=9781741962239|location=Millers Point, N.S.W}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most modern of the 'sixty-milers', the ''MV Stephen Brown''\u2014built in 1954\u2014nearly came to grief, when some air-vents that had been closed off and some of the deck hatches lost their covers in the stormy seas. She began to fill, with the water gradually entering her holds and developed a list. The hull sides at deck level began to go underwater, a circumstance very similar to that in the foundering of other 'sixty-milers'. The ''MV Stephen Brown'' made it through the heads into Sydney Harbour and Captain Don Turner initially proposed to beach her at Lady Jane Beach ([[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Lady Bay Beach]]) just inside [[Sydney Heads#South Head|South Head]]. That proved unnecessary. Instead the ship stood off the beach pumping out some of the water. She was then able to discharge her cargo at the CSR wharf at [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] as intended. The ''MV Stephen Brown'' was probably saved only by her great stability. Her ventilators and hatches were modified to decrease the risk of a reoccurrence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://arhv.anmm.gov.au/objects/132329|title=MV Stephen Brown|website=arhv.anmm.gov.au|access-date=2018-08-10}}</ref>\n\n''Hexham Bank'' had survived her time carrying coal as a 'sixty-miler' but, in June 1978, while preparing to load construction aggregate (\"blue metal\") at [[Bass Point Reserve|Bass Point]], she caught fire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131860501|title=Ship's fate undecided|date=1978-06-23|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2018-09-30|pages=3}}</ref> All her crew were rescued.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131860267|title=15 rescued from ship|date=1978-06-22|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2018-09-30|pages=1}}</ref> Her engine room was destroyed and the ship was deemed a \"constructive loss\" and scrapped.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh. He asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing for Ori to enter the Silent Woods, and its graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew. The game ends with the cycle beginning again, as a new spirit guardian falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\".

From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp'' is an irresistible challenge.

Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nThe game's story is centered on a new adventure to discover the world beyond the forest of Nibel, uncover the truths of the lost ones, and unearth Ori's true destiny.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps for Xbox One and Windows 10|website=Xbox.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821213035/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps|archive-date=2017-08-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh. He asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing for Ori to enter the Silent Woods, and its graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew. The game ends with the cycle beginning again, as a new spirit guardian falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp'' is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail - the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger.\"<ref name=\"Guardianreview\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.orithegame.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps Official Xbox website for the game]\n{{Authority control}}{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Orphans in fiction]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One X enhanced games]]\n[[Category:Metroidvania games]]\n[[Category:2020 video games]]\n[[Category:Video game art]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n", "name_user": "UGM9", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reception: Xbox review added.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps"}

The draft took place to fill the rosters of the league's new teams for the [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1979\u201380 season]]: the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]], [[Quebec Nordiques]] and [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]].  These four teams had joined the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] after a [[NHL\u2013WHA merger|merger agreement]] was reached with the [[World Hockey Association]].\n\nAs many WHA players also had their rights held by NHL teams, those NHL teams were allowed to reclaim their players.  In order to keep the NHL teams from plundering all the talent from the WHA-turned-NHL teams, each incoming franchise was allowed to protect up to two goaltenders and two skaters.  These were designated as \"priority selections\" in the Expansion Draft.\n\n==Rules==\n'''Reclaiming of players:''' The 17 existing NHL teams were allowed to reclaim any rights to former WHA players they held.  The four incoming franchises, however, were allowed to protect up to two goaltenders and two skaters, voiding their NHL rights.  These players were considered \"priority selections\" in the expansion draft.  Numerous deals were cut by the incoming teams to retain some of their players.  For instance, Quebec retained star forward [[R\u00e9al Cloutier|Real Cloutier]] by trading a first-round draft choice to the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], which held Cloutier's rights; that pick was used to select perennial superstar [[Denis Savard]].\n\n[[Wayne Gretzky]] was a special case - although no team held his NHL rights, under existing rules he would have been removed from the Oilers and placed into the NHL Entry Draft.  However, Gretzky had been signed by Oilers owner [[Peter Pocklington]] to a personal services contract instead of a standard player contract.  Confronted with the probability of being drafted first overall by the last place Colorado Rockies, Gretzky refused to void his contract with Pocklington.  After deliberation, the Oilers were allowed to keep Gretzky as one of their priority selections, and agreed to choose last in each round of the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]] as further compensation.\n\n[[Gordie Howe]] was a second special case - as a gentlemen's agreement between the [[Hartford Whalers]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]], which held his NHL rights, the Red Wings declined to reclaim the 51-year-old Howe.\n\n[[Bobby Hull]] was a third special case - although he was formally reclaimed by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], the Black Hawks quickly released the 40-year-old Hull, allowing him to return to the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]].\n\n'''Expansion draft:''' Each of the 17 existing NHL teams were allowed to protect 15 skaters and two veteran goalies.\n\n'''Compensation:''' The 17 existing NHL teams received $125,000 for each player drafted, these payments being funded by the $6 million in franchise fees each of the former WHA teams paid to join the NHL.\n\n==WHA Dispersal Draft==\nFollowing the WHA season, and prior to the NHL reclaiming players, the WHA dispersed players from the teams not accepted into the NHL.  Players that were twenty years old or younger were available to all twenty-one NHL teams in the entry draft, the remaining players were made available (temporarily in the case of Liut) to the four merging teams from the WHA.<ref>Greig p.213</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/07/archives/nhl-players-group-consents-to-merger.html |title=N.H.L.

Crowder began the season as a Bull but returned to the [[Peterborough Petes]] after just five games.  The Cincinnati Stingers used two who were drafted: [[Mike Gartner]] (4th) and [[Mark Messier]] (48th).  Messier was not old enough for the 1979 draft but was eligible because of his WHA service time.<ref>{{cite web |title=1979 Draft Quick Facts |url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1979/79facts.html

The draft took place to fill the rosters of the league's new teams for the [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1979\u201380 season]]: the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]], [[Quebec Nordiques]] and [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]].  These four teams had joined the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] after a [[NHL\u2013WHA merger|merger agreement]] was reached with the [[World Hockey Association]].\n\nAs many WHA players also had their rights held by NHL teams, those NHL teams were allowed to reclaim their players.  In order to keep the NHL teams from plundering all the talent from the WHA-turned-NHL teams, each incoming franchise was allowed to protect up to two goaltenders and two skaters.  These were designated as \"priority selections\" in the Expansion Draft.\n\n==Rules==\n'''Reclaiming of players:''' The 17 existing NHL teams were allowed to reclaim any rights to former WHA players they held.  The four incoming franchises, however, were allowed to protect up to two goaltenders and two skaters, voiding their NHL rights.  These players were considered \"priority selections\" in the expansion draft.  Numerous deals were cut by the incoming teams to retain some of their players.  For instance, Quebec retained star forward [[R\u00e9al Cloutier|Real Cloutier]] by trading a first-round draft choice to the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], which held Cloutier's rights; that pick was used to select perennial superstar [[Denis Savard]].\n\n[[Wayne Gretzky]] was a special case - although no team held his NHL rights, under existing rules he would have been removed from the Oilers and placed into the NHL Entry Draft.  However, Gretzky had been signed by Oilers owner [[Peter Pocklington]] to a personal services contract instead of a standard player contract.  Confronted with the probability of being drafted first overall by the last place Colorado Rockies, Gretzky refused to void his contract with Pocklington.  After deliberation, the Oilers were allowed to keep Gretzky as one of their priority selections, and agreed to choose last in each round of the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]] as further compensation.\n\n[[Gordie Howe]] was a second special case - as a gentlemen's agreement between the [[Hartford Whalers]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]], which held his NHL rights, the Red Wings declined to reclaim the 51-year-old Howe.\n\n[[Bobby Hull]] was a third special case - although he was formally reclaimed by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], the Black Hawks quickly released the 40-year-old Hull, allowing him to return to the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]].\n\n'''Expansion draft:''' Each of the 17 existing NHL teams were allowed to protect 15 skaters and two veteran goalies.\n\n'''Compensation:''' The 17 existing NHL teams received $125,000 for each player drafted, these payments being funded by the $6 million in franchise fees each of the former WHA teams paid to join the NHL.\n\n==WHA Dispersal Draft==\nFollowing the WHA season, and prior to the NHL reclaiming players, the WHA dispersed players from the teams not accepted into the NHL.  Players that were twenty years old or younger were available to all twenty-one NHL teams in the entry draft, the remaining players were made available (temporarily in the case of Liut) to the four merging teams from the WHA.<ref>Greig p.213</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/07/archives/nhl-players-group-consents-to-merger.html |title=N.H.L.

Crowder began the season as a Bull but returned to the [[Peterborough Petes]] after just five games.  The Cincinnati Stingers used two who were drafted: [[Mike Gartner]] (4th) and [[Mark Messier]] (48th).  Messier was not old enough for the 1979 draft but was eligible because of his WHA service time.<ref>{{cite web |title=1979 Draft Quick Facts |url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1979/79facts.html
