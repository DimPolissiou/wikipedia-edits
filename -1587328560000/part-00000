While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken. Led by [[Francis Tumblety]], better known as the infamous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], the ghosts plot their escape while killing as many people as they can. The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall. Belphegor offers a solution where they retrieve Lilith's crook from Hell and use it to draw in all of the escaped souls and demons while Sam and Rowena perform a spell to close the rupture. At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong. Realizing that Dean still blames him for Mary's death, Castiel reveals that his powers are failing and decides that its time to move on with the situation seemingly under control.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 311\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Atomic Monsters\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jensen Ackles]]\n| WrittenBy       = Davy Perez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21751\n| Viewers         = 1.10<ref name=\"15.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|title=Chargers vs. Raiders adjusts up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108214556/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|archive-date=November 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam experiences a nightmare where he, under the influence of demon blood, appears to be leading several demons and kills several hunters including Dean and his old vampire friend Benny. Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters.

However, Andy, who hates what they are doing, kills his brother and then himself. The girl the Winchesters were protecting turns out to be [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], resurrected by God from the Empty and in search of The Equalizer, the gun God created to kill Jack.

However, Sam finds a resurrection spell Rowena was creating that could potentially bring Eileen back to life. The spell brings him into conflict with two witches who seek the spell for their own use. With the help of Dean and Eileen, Sam dispatches the witches, using a spell he learned from Rowena to kill one. At the same time, Castiel enjoys a vacation until he learns of a series of strange deaths in the area. Suspecting a djinn, Castiel helps a mother whose son has gone missing, ultimately discovering the local sheriff to be the culprit.

Lee explains that after a particularly bad hunt, he developed a view that the world is broken and he is owed to enjoy himself. Dean is able to kill the marid and reluctantly kills Lee, feeling that Lee is a monster and it is his duty as a hunter.

Donatello discovers from Metatron's notes that God has a secret fear that he only shared with his favorite, but God briefly takes control of Donatello and threatens to destroy everything they love if they don't stop. Refusing to stop and suspecting God's favorite to be Michael, the Winchesters and Castiel travel into Hell where they learn that Rowena has become the new Queen of Hell. Rowena's demons discover that Michael is no longer in Hell and she urges Dean and Castiel to mend their relationship. Having escaped the Cage, Michael now shares control of his body with Adam, but is left directionless and kills Lilith when the demon tries to take him to God. The Winchesters and Castiel capture Michael and attempt to convince him to help them with the assistance of Adam, but the archangel refuses to hear them out. Instead, Castiel shows Michael his memories of several of God's betrayals including the war with the Darkness, the alternate reality Michael and the murder of Jack. Completely disillusioned, Michael reveals that God can be trapped and provides them with the spell to do it.

God attempts to use Eileen to cut out the thing that is festering in Sam that is blocking God's ability to heal the wound, only to realize that it is hope. In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby. God explains that the monsters running rampant is a consequence of locking him away: without God around, darkness prevails in the world. At the same time, Dean and Castiel return to Purgatory in search of a Leviathan Blossom which they learn sprouts from the remains of a Leviathan. The two are ambushed by Leviathans working for a vengeful Eve, but manage to escape with the blossom and make up. Dean and Castiel attempt to use the spell to trap God, but Sam refuses to complete it, allowing God to heal his wound and regain his full power. God reveals that Sam's visions were actually God's memories of alternate Sam and Dean's and he is confident that they will end the same before departing. In the aftermath, Sam and Eileen share a kiss, but Eileen decides to leave for the time being. Despite everything, Sam still believes God was telling the truth about what will come if he is trapped and Dean vows to find another solution. In the Empty, Billie tells Jack that \"its time.\"\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 317\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = The Heroes' Journey\n| DirectedBy      = John Showalter\n| WrittenBy       = Andrew Dabb\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|23}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21760\n| Viewers         = 0.99<ref name=\"15.10\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-jan-23-2020/|title='A Million Little Things' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 27, 2020|accessdate=January 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127162825/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-jan-23-2020/|archive-date=January 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = As Garth calls them for help, Sam and Dean begin experiencing regular people issues such as cavities, getting sick and car trouble. Garth suggests that because they were the heroes of God's story, God protected them in the past from such regular problems but has since downgraded them back to normal people. Garth's wife Bess reveals that her cousin Brad was found badly wounded from a Wraith attack. Brad explains that he was attempting to make money in an underground monster fight club that the Winchesters attempt to shut down. However, the Winchesters now being normal people works against them and they are captured to be pitted against a massive vampire named Maul. Garth rescues the Winchesters, blows up the fight club and kills Maul, causing Dean to suggest that Garth was the true hero of the story this time.

Though Fortuna wins, Sam and Dean impress her as being true heroes and she chooses to restore their luck anyway. At the same time, Castiel receives a call about a man who was murdered by having his heart ripped out and eaten and to Castiel's shock, the culprit is a resurrected Jack. Castiel discovers that Jack is targeting Grigori, fallen angels who have been feeding on the souls of innocent people, one of whom had murdered Claire Novak's mother nearly five years before. After Castiel rescues Jack from a Grigori, the Winchester family is finally reunited. Jack explains that Billie kept him hidden in the Empty, waiting for God to leave to resurrect him.

As the Winchesters and Castiel deal with the return of Jack, who is still soulless, Jody Mills is kidnapped by Dark Kaia who demands that they keep their promise to her and send Dark Kaia back to the Bad Place. Dark Kaia reveals that the Bad Place is dying and their Kaia is still alive, trapped in the other world. Horrified that Kaia has been trapped for two years in another universe, the group attempts to find a way back, hindered by Jack's inability to use his powers without drawing attention. Jack eventually convinces a Reaper named Merle to help them temporarily hide his use of powers from God, allowing the Winchesters and Dark Kaia to cross to the Bad Place and rescue their Kaia. Dark Kaia chooses to die with her world as it is consumed while Kaia returns home with Jody to be reunited with Claire. In the aftermath, Billie kills Merle for her failure to keep Jack in check and warns that they must all play their parts if they are to beat God. Billie reveals that one of the books in her library describes God's ultimate demise, but refuses to explain more than the fact that Jack and the Winchesters are an integral part of it.

To continue Jack's quest to become stronger, Billie directs them to find the Occultum, a mysterious mystical object. The Winchesters track the Occultum to Anael who reveals that she gave it to [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]] before she died and Ruby hid it in Hell. However, this proves to be a trap as Anael hires demons to kill the Winchesters. In order to find out where it is really hidden, Castiel has Jack send him into the Empty where the Shadow, manifesting in the form of [[Meg Masters|Meg]], allows him to awaken Ruby. In exchange for Castiel promising to try to get her out, Ruby directs him to the Occultum's hiding place though Castiel is briefly tortured by the Shadow before Jack gets him out again. To keep God from knowing what they are up to, the Winchesters rescue a pair of alternate Sams and Deans trapped between worlds and have their counterparts pose as them. Though attacked by hellhounds guarding the Occultum, they are able to retrieve it and the Occultum transports Jack to the [[Garden of Eden]] where he is confronted by a mysterious young girl and the Snake before being returned to Earth. In the aftermath, the alternate Sam and Dean depart for new lives in [[Brazil]] while a crying Jack expresses remorse for Mary Winchester's death and begs forgiveness.

While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken. Led by [[Francis Tumblety]], better known as the infamous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], the ghosts plot their escape while killing as many people as they can. The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall. Belphegor offers a solution where they retrieve Lilith's crook from Hell and use it to draw in all of the escaped souls and demons while Sam and Rowena perform a spell to close the rupture. At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong. Realizing that Dean still blames him for Mary's death, Castiel reveals that his powers are failing and decides that its time to move on with the situation seemingly under control.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 311\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Atomic Monsters\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jensen Ackles]]\n| WrittenBy       = Davy Perez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21751\n| Viewers         = 1.10<ref name=\"15.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|title=Chargers vs. Raiders adjusts up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108214556/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|archive-date=November 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam experiences a nightmare where he, under the influence of demon blood, appears to be leading several demons and kills several hunters including Dean and his old vampire friend Benny. Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters.

However, Andy, who hates what they are doing, kills his brother and then himself. The girl the Winchesters were protecting turns out to be [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], resurrected by God from the Empty and in search of The Equalizer, the gun God created to kill Jack.

Eileen's soul was dragged to Hell by the hellhound that killed her, but she managed to escape when God opened Hell. As Eileen fears returning to Hell or going insane, Dean suggests using Rowena's journals to create a Soul Catcher to contain her. However, Sam finds a resurrection spell Rowena was creating that could potentially bring Eileen back to life. The spell brings him into conflict with two witches who seek the spell for their own use. With the help of Dean and Eileen, Sam dispatches the witches, using a spell he learned from Rowena to kill one. At the same time, Castiel enjoys a vacation until he learns of a series of strange deaths in the area.

After enjoying catching up with Lee, Dean manages to locate Angela's body and discovers that Lee is the culprit, having kidnapped and fed people to a creature called a [[marid]] in exchange for riches and health. Lee explains that after a particularly bad hunt, he developed a view that the world is broken and he is owed to enjoy himself. Dean is able to kill the marid and reluctantly kills Lee, feeling that Lee is a monster and it is his duty as a hunter. At the same time, Castiel suggests exploring Sam's link with God to learn more, but it backfires and makes Sam unconscious.

Rowena's demons discover that Michael is no longer in Hell and she urges Dean and Castiel to mend their relationship.

God attempts to use Eileen to cut out the thing that is festering in Sam that is blocking God's ability to heal the wound, only to realize that it is hope. In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby.

Horrified that Kaia has been trapped for two years in another universe, the group attempts to find a way back, hindered by Jack's inability to use his powers without drawing attention.

In exchange for Castiel promising to try to get her out, Ruby directs him to the Occultum's hiding place though Castiel is briefly tortured by the Shadow before Jack gets him out again.

This can be interpreted as Boundary or Bright Brook.\n\nPrior to the intense and swift development of the Colliery at the turn of the 20th century, Shirebrook, even as late as 1872 it was little more than a chapelry of the larger Pleasley.

Professor [[Arnold Lupton]] of [[Sheffield]] was the Mining Engineer. The sinking of two shafts(plus a pumping shaft) was based on independent surveys by Henry Hall and Matthew Fisher, Managers of working collieries. The nineteen feet (5.8m) wide shafts met the 'Top Hard' seam at 430 yards (484m)\n\nBy 1897, a 'model village' was already being built close to the colliery to house workers. The Derbyshire Times of 30 July 1897 reports \"About half a mile away a model village is springing up, some 150 houses have already been erected and about 420 are to be built\"\n\n[[File:58010 Shirebrook Colliery.jpg|thumb|Former Shirebrook Colliery in 2007]]\n[[File:EU25-2004 European Union map enlargement.svg|thumb|220px|left|{{legend|#ffcc00|majority of Sports Direct employees came from countries marked yellow}}]]\nShirebrook Colliery operated in the town until April 1993.

The [[Parareptilia]] and [[synapsid]] amniotes were common during the late [[Paleozoic]], while [[diapsid]]s became dominant during the [[Mesozoic]]. In the sea, the [[bony fishes]] became dominant.

Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world's water bodies, both freshwater and marine. The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea [[snakes]], penguins, cetaceans).\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are several ways of classifying animals. [[Evolutionary taxonomy|Evolutionary systematics]] relies on [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[evolution]]ary history, which is determined through similarities in anatomy and, if possible, the [[genetics]] of organisms. [[Cladistics|Phylogenetic classification]] is based solely on [[phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian water bugs: their biology and identification (Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Gerromorpha & Nepomorpha)|year=2004|publisher=Apollo Books|isbn=978-87-88757-78-1|author=Andersen, N.M.|author2=Weir, T.A. |page=38}}</ref> Evolutionary systematics gives an overview; phylogenetic systematics gives detail.

[[New York (state)|New York]], page 33: ''Comment: The problem of naming sister groups''</ref>\n\n=== Traditional classification ===\n[[File:Spindle diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional spindle diagram of the evolution of the vertebrates at class level]]\n\nConventional classification has living vertebrates grouped into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] traits. This classification is the one most commonly encountered in school textbooks, overviews, non-specialist, and popular works. The [[extant taxon|extant]] vertebrates are:<ref name=\"Romer\"/>\n\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n** Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fishes)\n** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n** Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fishes)\n** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians)\n** Class [[Reptilia]] (reptiles)\n** Class [[Aves]] (birds)\n** Class [[Mammalia]] (mammals)\n\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the [[Placodermi]] and the [[Acanthodii]].\n\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the [[phylogeny]] of [[labyrinthodontia|early amphibians]] and reptiles. An example based on Janvier (1981, 1997), Shu ''et al.'' (2003), and Benton (2004)<ref name=\"Benton2004\">{{cite book | last =Benton | first =M.J. | authorlink =Michael Benton | title =Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher =[[Blackwell Publishing]] | date= 1 November 2004 |edition=Third | location = | pages =33, 455 pp | url =http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0632056378}}</ref> is given here:\n\n\u2020: Extinct\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n**''[[Palaeospondylus]]''\n** '''Superclass [[Agnatha]]''' or [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] ([[lamprey]]s and other jawless fishes)\n** '''Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]]''' (vertebrates with jaws)\n*** Class \u2020[[Placodermi]] (extinct armoured fishes)\n*** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n*** Class \u2020[[Acanthodii]] (extinct spiny \"sharks\")\n*** '''Superclass [[Osteichthyes]]''' (bony vertebrates)\n**** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned bony fishes)\n**** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fishes, including the tetrapods)\n**** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians, some ancestral to the [[amniotes]])\u2014now a paraphyletic group\n**** Class [[Synapsida]] (mammals and the extinct mammal-like reptiles)\n**** Class [[Sauropsida]] (reptiles and birds)\n\nWhile this traditional classification is orderly, most of the groups are [[paraphyletic]], i.e. do not contain all descendants of the class's common ancestor.<ref name=Benton2004 /> For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles as well as mammals and birds; the [[agnatha]]ns have given rise to the [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]]; the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]] have given rise to the [[tetrapoda|land vertebrates]]; the traditional \"[[Labyrinthodont|amphibians]]\" have given rise to the [[Reptilia|reptiles]] (traditionally including the [[synapsid]]s or mammal-like \"reptiles\"), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on [[phylogeny]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, organized by their known evolutionary history and sometimes disregarding the conventional interpretations of their anatomy and physiology.\n\n=== Phylogenetic relationships ===\nIn [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic taxonomy]], the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks but illustrated as a nested \"family tree\" known as a [[phylogenetic tree]].

Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world's water bodies, both freshwater and marine. The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea [[snakes]], penguins, cetaceans).\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are several ways of classifying animals.

His influential textbook ''Language'', published in 1933, presented a comprehensive description of American structural linguistics.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1933</ref> He made significant contributions to [[Indo-European linguistics|Indo-European historical linguistics]], the description of [[Austronesian languages]], and description of languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family.\n\nBloomfield's approach to linguistics was characterized by its emphasis on the [[scientific method|scientific]] basis of linguistics, adherence to [[behaviorism]] especially in his later work, and emphasis on formal procedures for the analysis of linguistic data. The influence of Bloomfieldian structural linguistics declined in the late 1950s and 1960s as the theory of [[generative grammar]] developed by [[Noam Chomsky]] came to predominate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloomfield was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on April 1, 1887, to Jewish parents (Sigmund Bloomfield and Carola Buber Bloomfield). His father immigrated to the United States as a child in 1868; the original family name ''Blumenfeld'' was changed to Bloomfield after their arrival.<ref>Depres, Leon, 1987, p. 11, Fn. 1</ref> In 1896 his family moved to [[Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin]], where he attended elementary school, but returned to Chicago for secondary school.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 5\u20136</ref> His uncle [[Maurice Bloomfield]] was a prominent linguist at [[Johns Hopkins University]],<ref name=\"Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4\">Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4</ref><ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\">Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87</ref> and his aunt [[Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler]] was a well-known concert pianist.<ref name=\"Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4\"/>\n\nBloomfield attended [[Harvard College]] from 1903 to 1906, graduating with the [[Bachelor's degree|A.B.]] degree.<ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\"/>  He subsequently began graduate work at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]], taking courses in [[German language|German]] and Germanic [[philology]], in addition to courses in other Indo-European languages.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 7\u20138</ref> A meeting with Indo-Europeanist [[Eduard Prokosch]], a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin, convinced Bloomfield to pursue a career in linguistics.<ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\"/> In 1908 Bloomfield moved to the [[University of Chicago]] where he took courses in German and Indo-European philology with Frances A. Wood and [[Carl Darling Buck]]. His doctoral dissertation in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] historical linguistics was supervised by Wood, and he graduated in 1909. He undertook further studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1913 and 1914 with leading Indo-Europeanists [[August Leskien]], [[Karl Brugmann]], as well as [[Hermann Oldenberg]], a specialist in [[Vedic Sanskrit]]. Bloomfield also studied at G\u00f6ttingen with Sanskrit specialist [[Jacob Wackernagel]], and considered both Wackernagel and the Sanskrit grammatical tradition of rigorous grammatical analysis associated with [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] as important influences on both his historical and descriptive work.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 16</ref><ref>Rogers, David, 1987</ref> Further training in Europe was a condition for promotion at the [[University of Illinois]] from Instructor to the rank of Assistant Professor.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBloomfield was instructor in [[German language|German]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]], 1909\u20131910; Instructor in German at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], 1910\u20131913; Assistant Professor of Comparative Philology and German, also University of Illinois, 1913\u20131921; Professor of German and Linguistics at the [[Ohio State University]], 1921\u20131927; Professor of Germanic Philology at the [[University of Chicago]], 1927\u20131940; [[Sterling Professor]] of Linguistics at [[Yale University]], 1940\u20131949. During the summer of 1925 Bloomfield worked as Assistant Ethnologist with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in the Canadian Department of Mines, undertaking [[Field work|linguistic field work]] on [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]]; this position was arranged by [[Edward Sapir]], who was then Chief of the Division of Anthropology,  Victoria Museum, [[Geological Survey of Canada]], Canadian Department of Mines.<ref>Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 88</ref><ref>Hockett, Charles, 1987, p. 40</ref>\n\nBloomfield was one of the founding members of the [[Linguistic Society of America]]. In 1924, along with George M. Bolling (Ohio State University) and [[Edgar H. Sturtevant|Edgar Sturtevant]] (Yale University) he formed a committee to organize the creation of the Society, and  drafted the call for the Society's foundation.<ref>Anonymous, 1925</ref><ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 27</ref> He contributed the lead article to the inaugural issue of the Society's journal [[Language (journal)|''Language'']],<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\">Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925</ref> and was President of the Society in 1935.<ref>Hockett, Charles, 1970, 323</ref> He taught in the Society's summer [[Linguistic Society of America#Linguistic Institutes|Linguistic Institute]] in 1938\u20131941, with the 1938\u20131940 Institutes being held in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], and the 1941 Institute in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].<ref>Bloch lists only 1938\u201340, but Hall lists 1938\u20131941; Bloch, Bernard, 1949, 88; Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 52</ref>\n\n==Indo-European linguistics==\nBloomfield's earliest work was in historical Germanic studies, beginning with his dissertation, and continuing with a number of papers on Indo-European and Germanic phonology and morphology.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1909/1910</ref><ref>Bloch, Bernard, 1949, 88</ref>  His post-doctoral studies in Germany further strengthened his expertise in the [[Neogrammarian]] tradition, which still dominated Indo-European historical studies.<ref>Lehman, Winfred, 1987, pp. 163\u2013164</ref> Bloomfield throughout his career, but particularly during his early career, emphasized the Neogrammarian principle of regular [[sound change]] as a foundational concept in historical linguistics.<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\"/><ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a\">Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a</ref>\n\nBloomfield's work in Indo-European beyond his dissertation was limited to an article on [[palatal consonant]]s in Sanskrit<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1911</ref> and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with P\u0101\u1e47ini,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1927</ref> in addition to a number of book reviews. Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo-European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks, ''An introduction to language'' (1914), and his seminal ''Language'' (1933).<ref name=\"Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 164-165\">Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> In his textbooks he selected Indo-European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change, and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work: (a) appropriate data in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed; (b) application of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]; (c) reconstruction of proto-forms.<ref name=\"Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 164-165\"/> He further emphasized the importance of [[Dialectology|dialect studies]] where appropriate, and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige, and the impact of meaning.<ref>Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 165</ref> In addition to regular linguistic change, Bloomfield also allowed for [[Loanword|borrowing]] and [[Comparative method (linguistics)|analogy]].<ref>Lehman, Winfred, 1987, 167</ref>\n\nIt is argued that Bloomfield's Indo-European work had two broad implications: \"He stated clearly the theoretical bases for Indo-European linguistics\" and \"he established the study of Indo-European languages firmly within general linguistics.\"<ref>Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, pp. 167\u2013168</ref>\n\n===Sanskrit studies===\nAs part of his training with leading Indo-Europeanists in Germany in 1913 and 1914 Bloomfield studied the Sanskrit grammatical tradition originating with  [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], who lived in northwestern [[India]] during the fifth or fourth century BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=P\u0101\u1e47ini: a survey of research|last=Cardona|first=George|date=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120814940|location=Delhi|language=English|oclc = 1014545991}}</ref> P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is characterized by its extreme thoroughness and explicitness in accounting for Sanskrit linguistic forms, and by its complex context-sensitive, rule-based generative structure. Bloomfield noted that \"P\u0101\u1e47ini gives the formation of every inflected, compounded, or derived word, with an exact statement of the sound-variations (including accent) and of the meaning\".<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1929, 274; cited in Rogers, David, 1987, p. 88</ref> In a letter to Algonquianist Truman Michelson, Bloomfield noted \"My models are P\u0101\u1e47ini and the kind of work done in Indo-European by my teacher, Professor Wackernagel of Basle.\"<ref>Hockett, Charles, 1987, p. 41</ref>\n\nP\u0101\u1e47ini's systematic approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) an inventory of sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a list of classes of [[Morpheme|morphs]].<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, 90</ref> Bloomfield's approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook ''Language'' reflect the influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini in his treatment of basic concepts such as ''linguistic form'', ''free form'', and others. Similarly, P\u0101\u1e47ini is the source for Bloomfield's use of the terms ''exocentric'' and ''endocentric'' used to describe [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] words.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wujastyk|first=Dominik|date=1982|title=Bloomfield and the Sanskrit Origin of the Terms 'Exocentric' and 'Endocentric'|journal= Historiographia Linguistica|language=en|volume=9|issue=1\u20132|pages=179\u2013184|doi=10.1075/hl.9.1-2.19wuj|issn=0302-5160}}</ref><ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 103\u2013114</ref> Concepts from P\u0101\u1e47ini are found in ''Eastern Ojibwa'', published posthumously in 1958, in particular his use of the concept of a [[Null morpheme|morphological zero]], a [[morphology (linguistics)|morpheme]] that has no overt realization.<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 120\u2013122</ref> P\u0101\u1e47ini's influence is also present in Bloomfield's approach to determining [[Lexical category|parts of speech]] (Bloomfield uses the term \"form-classes\") in both ''Eastern Ojibwa'' and in the later ''Menomini language'', published posthumously in 1962.<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 126\u2013128</ref>\n\n==Austronesian linguistics==\nWhile at the University of Illinois Bloomfield undertook research on [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language spoken in the [[Philippines]]. He carried out linguistic field work with Alfredo Viola Santiago, who was an engineering student at the university from 1914 to 1917. The results were published as ''Tagalog texts with grammatical analysis'', which includes a series of texts dictated by Santiago in addition to an extensive grammatical description and analysis of every word in the texts.<ref>Hockett, Charles F., 1970, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Bloomfield's work on Tagalog, from the beginning of field research to publication, took no more than two years.<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 174</ref> His study of Tagalog has been described as \"the best treatment of any Austronesian language&nbsp;... The result is a description of Tagalog which has never been surpassed for completeness, accuracy, and wealth of exemplification.\"<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 173</ref>\n\nBloomfield's only other publication on an Austronesian language was an article on the [[syntax]] of [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], based upon research undertaken with a native speaker of Ilocano who was a student at Yale University. This article has been described as a \"tour de force, for it covers in less than seven pages the entire taxonomic syntax of Ilocano\".<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 176</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1942</ref>\n\n==Algonquian linguistics==\nBloomfield's work on Algonquian languages had both [[Descriptive linguistics|descriptive]] and [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] components. He published extensively on four Algonquian languages: [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], publishing grammars, lexicons, and text collections. Bloomfield used the materials collected in his descriptive work to undertake comparative studies leading to the reconstruction of [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], with an early study reconstructing the [[phonology|sound system]] of Proto-Algonquian,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925a</ref> and a subsequent more extensive paper refining his phonological analysis and adding extensive historical information on general features of Algonquian grammar.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1946</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research on Cree, Menominee, and Ojibwe, and analysed the material in previously published Fox text collections. His first Algonquian research, beginning around 1919, involved study of text collections in the Fox language that had been published by [[William Jones (anthropologist)|William Jones]] and [[Truman Michelson]].<ref>Jones, William, 1907</ref><ref>Michelson, Truman, 1921</ref> Working through the texts in these collections, Bloomfield excerpted grammatical information to create a grammatical sketch of Fox.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\u20131927</ref> A lexicon of Fox based on his excerpted material was published posthumously.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1984b</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research on Menominee in the summers of 1920 and 1921, with further brief field research in September 1939 and intermittent visits from Menominee speakers in Chicago in the late 1930s, in addition to correspondence with speakers during the same period.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987, pp. 179, 187\u2013188</ref>  Material collected by [[Morris Swadesh]] in 1937 and 1938, often in response to specific queries from Bloomfield, supplemented his information.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987, pp. 179-180</ref> Significant publications include a collection of texts,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928</ref> a grammar and a lexicon (both published posthumously),<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1962</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1975</ref> in addition to a theoretically significant article on Menomini phonological alternations.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1939</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research in 1925 among Plains Cree speakers in [[Saskatchewan]] at the [[Division No. 16, Saskatchewan|Sweet Grass]] reserve, and also at the [[Division No. 6, Saskatchewan#List of Indian Reserves|Star Blanket]] reserve, resulting in two volumes of texts and a posthumous lexicon.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1930</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1934</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1984</ref> He also undertook brief field work on [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] at [[Opaskwayak Cree Nation|The Pas, Manitoba]]. Bloomfield's work on Swampy Cree provided data to support the predictive power of the hypothesis of exceptionless phonological change.<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a\"/>\n\nBloomfield's initial research on Ojibwe was through study of texts collected by William Jones, in addition to nineteenth century grammars and dictionaries.<ref>Jones, William, 1917, 1919</ref><ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987</ref> During the 1938 Linguistic Society of America [[Linguistic Society of America#Linguistic Institutes|Linguistic Institute]] held at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], he taught a field methods class with Andrew Medler, a speaker of the [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] dialect who was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], but spent most of his life on [[Walpole Island]], [[Ontario]]. The resulting grammatical description, transcribed sentences, texts, and lexicon were published posthumously in a single volume.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958</ref> In 1941 Bloomfield worked with Ottawa dialect speaker Angeline Williams at the 1941 Linguistic Institute held at the [[University of North Carolina]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], resulting in a posthumously published volume of texts.<ref>Nichols, John and Leonard Bloomfield, eds., 1991</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*Bloomfield, Leonard. 1909/1910. \"A semasiological differentiation in Germanic secondary ablaut\".

His influential textbook ''Language'', published in 1933, presented a comprehensive description of American structural linguistics.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1933</ref> He made significant contributions to [[Indo-European linguistics|Indo-European historical linguistics]], the description of [[Austronesian languages]], and description of languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family.\n\nBloomfield's approach to linguistics was characterized by its emphasis on the [[scientific method|scientific]] basis of linguistics, adherence to [[behaviorism]] especially in his later work, and emphasis on formal procedures for the analysis of linguistic data. The influence of Bloomfieldian structural linguistics declined in the late 1950s and 1960s as the theory of [[generative grammar]] developed by [[Noam Chomsky]] came to predominate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloomfield was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on April 1, 1887, to Jewish parents (Sigmund Bloomfield and Carola Buber Bloomfield). His father immigrated to the United States as a child in 1868; the original family name ''Blumenfeld'' was changed to Bloomfield after their arrival.<ref>Depres, Leon, 1987, p. 11, Fn. 1</ref> In 1896 his family moved to [[Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin]], where he attended elementary school, but returned to Chicago for secondary school.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 5\u20136</ref> His uncle [[Maurice Bloomfield]] was a prominent linguist at [[Johns Hopkins University]],<ref name=\"Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4\">Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4</ref><ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\">Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87</ref> and his aunt [[Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler]] was a well-known concert pianist.<ref name=\"Despres, Leon, 1987, p. 4\"/>\n\nBloomfield attended [[Harvard College]] from 1903 to 1906, graduating with the [[Bachelor's degree|A.B.]] degree.<ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\"/>  He subsequently began graduate work at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]], taking courses in [[German language|German]] and Germanic [[philology]], in addition to courses in other Indo-European languages.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 7\u20138</ref> A meeting with Indo-Europeanist [[Eduard Prokosch]], a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin, convinced Bloomfield to pursue a career in linguistics.<ref name=\"Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 87\"/> In 1908 Bloomfield moved to the [[University of Chicago]] where he took courses in German and Indo-European philology with Frances A. Wood and [[Carl Darling Buck]]. His doctoral dissertation in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] historical linguistics was supervised by Wood, and he graduated in 1909. He undertook further studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1913 and 1914 with leading Indo-Europeanists [[August Leskien]], [[Karl Brugmann]], as well as [[Hermann Oldenberg]], a specialist in [[Vedic Sanskrit]]. Bloomfield also studied at G\u00f6ttingen with Sanskrit specialist [[Jacob Wackernagel]], and considered both Wackernagel and the Sanskrit grammatical tradition of rigorous grammatical analysis associated with [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] as important influences on both his historical and descriptive work.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 16</ref><ref>Rogers, David, 1987</ref> Further training in Europe was a condition for promotion at the [[University of Illinois]] from Instructor to the rank of Assistant Professor.<ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBloomfield was instructor in [[German language|German]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]], 1909\u20131910; Instructor in German at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], 1910\u20131913; Assistant Professor of Comparative Philology and German, also University of Illinois, 1913\u20131921; Professor of German and Linguistics at the [[Ohio State University]], 1921\u20131927; Professor of Germanic Philology at the [[University of Chicago]], 1927\u20131940; [[Sterling Professor]] of Linguistics at [[Yale University]], 1940\u20131949. During the summer of 1925 Bloomfield worked as Assistant Ethnologist with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in the Canadian Department of Mines, undertaking [[Field work|linguistic field work]] on [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]]; this position was arranged by [[Edward Sapir]], who was then Chief of the Division of Anthropology,  Victoria Museum, [[Geological Survey of Canada]], Canadian Department of Mines.<ref>Bloch, Bernard, 1949, p. 88</ref><ref>Hockett, Charles, 1987, p. 40</ref>\n\nBloomfield was one of the founding members of the [[Linguistic Society of America]]. In 1924, along with George M. Bolling (Ohio State University) and [[Edgar H. Sturtevant|Edgar Sturtevant]] (Yale University) he formed a committee to organize the creation of the Society, and  drafted the call for the Society's foundation.<ref>Anonymous, 1925</ref><ref>Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 27</ref> He contributed the lead article to the inaugural issue of the Society's journal [[Language (journal)|''Language'']],<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\">Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925</ref> and was President of the Society in 1935.<ref>Hockett, Charles, 1970, 323</ref> He taught in the Society's summer [[Linguistic Society of America#Linguistic Institutes|Linguistic Institute]] in 1938\u20131941, with the 1938\u20131940 Institutes being held in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], and the 1941 Institute in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].<ref>Bloch lists only 1938\u201340, but Hall lists 1938\u20131941; Bloch, Bernard, 1949, 88; Hall, Robert, 1990, p. 52</ref>\n\n==Indo-European linguistics==\nBloomfield's earliest work was in historical Germanic studies, beginning with his dissertation, and continuing with a number of papers on Indo-European and Germanic phonology and morphology.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1909/1910</ref><ref>Bloch, Bernard, 1949, 88</ref>  His post-doctoral studies in Germany further strengthened his expertise in the [[Neogrammarian]] tradition, which still dominated Indo-European historical studies.<ref>Lehman, Winfred, 1987, pp. 163\u2013164</ref> Bloomfield throughout his career, but particularly during his early career, emphasized the Neogrammarian principle of regular [[sound change]] as a foundational concept in historical linguistics.<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\"/><ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a\">Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a</ref>\n\nBloomfield's work in Indo-European beyond his dissertation was limited to an article on [[palatal consonant]]s in Sanskrit<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1911</ref> and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with P\u0101\u1e47ini,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1927</ref> in addition to a number of book reviews. Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo-European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks, ''An introduction to language'' (1914), and his seminal ''Language'' (1933).<ref name=\"Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 164-165\">Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> In his textbooks he selected Indo-European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change, and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work: (a) appropriate data in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed; (b) application of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]; (c) reconstruction of proto-forms.<ref name=\"Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 164-165\"/> He further emphasized the importance of [[Dialectology|dialect studies]] where appropriate, and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige, and the impact of meaning.<ref>Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, 165</ref> In addition to regular linguistic change, Bloomfield also allowed for [[Loanword|borrowing]] and [[Comparative method (linguistics)|analogy]].<ref>Lehman, Winfred, 1987, 167</ref>\n\nIt is argued that Bloomfield's Indo-European work had two broad implications: \"He stated clearly the theoretical bases for Indo-European linguistics\" and \"he established the study of Indo-European languages firmly within general linguistics.\"<ref>Lehmann, Winfred, 1987, pp. 167\u2013168</ref>\n\n===Sanskrit studies===\nAs part of his training with leading Indo-Europeanists in Germany in 1913 and 1914 Bloomfield studied the Sanskrit grammatical tradition originating with  [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], who lived in northwestern [[India]] during the fifth or fourth century BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=P\u0101\u1e47ini: a survey of research|last=Cardona|first=George|date=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120814940|location=Delhi|language=English|oclc = 1014545991}}</ref> P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is characterized by its extreme thoroughness and explicitness in accounting for Sanskrit linguistic forms, and by its complex context-sensitive, rule-based generative structure. Bloomfield noted that \"P\u0101\u1e47ini gives the formation of every inflected, compounded, or derived word, with an exact statement of the sound-variations (including accent) and of the meaning\".<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1929, 274; cited in Rogers, David, 1987, p. 88</ref> In a letter to Algonquianist Truman Michelson, Bloomfield noted \"My models are P\u0101\u1e47ini and the kind of work done in Indo-European by my teacher, Professor Wackernagel of Basle.\"<ref>Hockett, Charles, 1987, p. 41</ref>\n\nP\u0101\u1e47ini's systematic approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) an inventory of sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a list of classes of [[Morpheme|morphs]].<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, 90</ref> Bloomfield's approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook ''Language'' reflect the influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini in his treatment of basic concepts such as ''linguistic form'', ''free form'', and others. Similarly, P\u0101\u1e47ini is the source for Bloomfield's use of the terms ''exocentric'' and ''endocentric'' used to describe [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] words.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wujastyk|first=Dominik|date=1982|title=Bloomfield and the Sanskrit Origin of the Terms 'Exocentric' and 'Endocentric'|journal= Historiographia Linguistica|language=en|volume=9|issue=1\u20132|pages=179\u2013184|doi=10.1075/hl.9.1-2.19wuj|issn=0302-5160}}</ref><ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 103\u2013114</ref> Concepts from P\u0101\u1e47ini are found in ''Eastern Ojibwa'', published posthumously in 1958, in particular his use of the concept of a [[Null morpheme|morphological zero]], a [[morphology (linguistics)|morpheme]] that has no overt realization.<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 120\u2013122</ref> P\u0101\u1e47ini's influence is also present in Bloomfield's approach to determining [[Lexical category|parts of speech]] (Bloomfield uses the term \"form-classes\") in both ''Eastern Ojibwa'' and in the later ''Menomini language'', published posthumously in 1962.<ref>Rogers, David, 1987, pp. 126\u2013128</ref>\n\n==Austronesian linguistics==\nWhile at the University of Illinois Bloomfield undertook research on [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language spoken in the [[Philippines]]. He carried out linguistic field work with Alfredo Viola Santiago, who was an engineering student at the university from 1914 to 1917. The results were published as ''Tagalog texts with grammatical analysis'', which includes a series of texts dictated by Santiago in addition to an extensive grammatical description and analysis of every word in the texts.<ref>Hockett, Charles F., 1970, pp. 78\u201379</ref> Bloomfield's work on Tagalog, from the beginning of field research to publication, took no more than two years.<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 174</ref> His study of Tagalog has been described as \"the best treatment of any Austronesian language&nbsp;... The result is a description of Tagalog which has never been surpassed for completeness, accuracy, and wealth of exemplification.\"<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 173</ref>\n\nBloomfield's only other publication on an Austronesian language was an article on the [[syntax]] of [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], based upon research undertaken with a native speaker of Ilocano who was a student at Yale University. This article has been described as a \"tour de force, for it covers in less than seven pages the entire taxonomic syntax of Ilocano\".<ref>Wolff, John, 1987, p. 176</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1942</ref>\n\n==Algonquian linguistics==\nBloomfield's work on Algonquian languages had both [[Descriptive linguistics|descriptive]] and [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] components. He published extensively on four Algonquian languages: [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], publishing grammars, lexicons, and text collections. Bloomfield used the materials collected in his descriptive work to undertake comparative studies leading to the reconstruction of [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], with an early study reconstructing the [[phonology|sound system]] of Proto-Algonquian,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925a</ref> and a subsequent more extensive paper refining his phonological analysis and adding extensive historical information on general features of Algonquian grammar.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1946</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research on Cree, Menominee, and Ojibwe, and analysed the material in previously published Fox text collections. His first Algonquian research, beginning around 1919, involved study of text collections in the Fox language that had been published by [[William Jones (anthropologist)|William Jones]] and [[Truman Michelson]].<ref>Jones, William, 1907</ref><ref>Michelson, Truman, 1921</ref> Working through the texts in these collections, Bloomfield excerpted grammatical information to create a grammatical sketch of Fox.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1925\u20131927</ref> A lexicon of Fox based on his excerpted material was published posthumously.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1984b</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research on Menominee in the summers of 1920 and 1921, with further brief field research in September 1939 and intermittent visits from Menominee speakers in Chicago in the late 1930s, in addition to correspondence with speakers during the same period.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987, pp. 179, 187\u2013188</ref>  Material collected by [[Morris Swadesh]] in 1937 and 1938, often in response to specific queries from Bloomfield, supplemented his information.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987, pp. 179-180</ref> Significant publications include a collection of texts,<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928</ref> a grammar and a lexicon (both published posthumously),<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1962</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1975</ref> in addition to a theoretically significant article on Menomini phonological alternations.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1939</ref>\n\nBloomfield undertook field research in 1925 among Plains Cree speakers in [[Saskatchewan]] at the [[Division No. 16, Saskatchewan|Sweet Grass]] reserve, and also at the [[Division No. 6, Saskatchewan#List of Indian Reserves|Star Blanket]] reserve, resulting in two volumes of texts and a posthumous lexicon.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1930</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1934</ref><ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1984</ref> He also undertook brief field work on [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] at [[Opaskwayak Cree Nation|The Pas, Manitoba]]. Bloomfield's work on Swampy Cree provided data to support the predictive power of the hypothesis of exceptionless phonological change.<ref name=\"Bloomfield, Leonard, 1928a\"/>\n\nBloomfield's initial research on Ojibwe was through study of texts collected by William Jones, in addition to nineteenth century grammars and dictionaries.<ref>Jones, William, 1917, 1919</ref><ref>Goddard, Ives, 1987</ref> During the 1938 Linguistic Society of America [[Linguistic Society of America#Linguistic Institutes|Linguistic Institute]] held at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], he taught a field methods class with Andrew Medler, a speaker of the [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] dialect who was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], but spent most of his life on [[Walpole Island]], [[Ontario]]. The resulting grammatical description, transcribed sentences, texts, and lexicon were published posthumously in a single volume.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958</ref> In 1941 Bloomfield worked with Ottawa dialect speaker Angeline Williams at the 1941 Linguistic Institute held at the [[University of North Carolina]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], resulting in a posthumously published volume of texts.<ref>Nichols, John and Leonard Bloomfield, eds., 1991</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*Bloomfield, Leonard. 1909/1910. \"A semasiological differentiation in Germanic secondary ablaut\".

Medals were awarded in the disciplines of [[single skating|men's singles, ladies' singles]], [[pair skating]], and [[ice dancing]]. The event was held at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] from March 20 to 25.\n\n==Competition notes==\nThe competition was open to skaters from [[International figure skating|ISU member nations]] who had reached the age of 15 by July 1, 2006. The corresponding competition for younger skaters was the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Junior Championships]].\n\nBased on the results of the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Championships]], each country was allowed between one and three entries per discipline. National associations selected their entries based on their own criteria.\n\nDue to the large number of entries at the World Championships, only the top 24 single skaters and top 20 pairs advanced to the free skating after the short program. In ice dancing, the top 30 couples in the [[compulsory dance]] advanced to the [[original dance]], and the top 24 couples after the original dance advanced to the [[Free dance (figure skating)|free dance]].\n\n[[Yukari Nakano]] and [[Carolina Kostner]] tied for 5th place with 168.92 points overall. Nakano finished 5th place on the tiebreak (free skating placement) and Kostner ended 6th.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Rosaleen|title=2007 World Figure Skating Championships, Ladies' Free Skate Highlights|url=http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2006/032507_ll.shtml |date=March 25, 2007|accessdate=March 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112183207/http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2006/032507_ll.shtml |archivedate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref> In the ladies' event, two world records were set: [[Yuna Kim]] for the short program with a score of 71.95,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Rosaleen|title=2007 World Figure Skating Championships, Ladies' Short Program Highlights|url=http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2006/032507_ls.shtml |date=March 25, 2007|accessdate=March 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112183212/http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2006/032507_ls.shtml |archivedate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref> and [[Mao Asada]] for the free skating with a score of 133.13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=38073 |title=Welcome to U.S. Figure Skating |work=U.S. Figure Skating |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213162440/http://usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=38073 |archivedate=2007-12-13 }}</ref>\n\n[[Shen Xue]] / [[Zhao Hongbo]] from [[People's Republic of China|China]] set a new world record of 71.07 points under the [[ISU Judging System]] for pairs' short program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2007-03-20-figure-skating-worlds_N.htm|title=Chinese pair dominates at figure skating worlds - USATODAY.com|work=USA Today}}</ref> Zhao proposed marriage to Shen on the ice following their free skating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/02/16/olympics.skating/index.html|title=Chinese couple cap comeback with figure skating gold|work=CNN}}</ref>\n\n==Medals table==\n{{Medals table\n | caption        = \n | host           = \n | flag_template  = \n | event          = \n | team           = \n | gold_JPN = 1 | silver_JPN = 2 | bronze_JPN = 0\n | gold_CHN = 1 | silver_CHN = 1 | bronze_CHN = 0\n | gold_BUL = 1 | silver_BUL = 0 | bronze_BUL = 0\n | gold_FRA = 1 | silver_FRA = 0 | bronze_FRA = 0\n | gold_CAN = 0 | silver_CAN = 1 | bronze_CAN = 0\n | gold_GER = 0 | silver_GER = 0 | bronze_GER = 1\n | gold_KOR = 0 | silver_KOR = 0 | bronze_KOR = 1\n | gold_SUI = 0 | silver_SUI = 0 | bronze_SUI = 1\n | gold_USA = 0 | silver_USA = 0 | bronze_USA = 1\n}}\n\n==Results==\n===Men===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1957, Harry Barnhart conceived the idea and Ernie Allen in the art department at the [[advertising agency]] Tatham-Laird & Kudner in [[Chicago, Illinois]] drew Mr. Clean as a muscular, tanned, [[bald]] man who cleans things very well.\n\nAccording to Procter & Gamble, the original model for the image of Mr. Clean was a [[United States Navy]] [[sailor]] from the city of [[Pensacola, Florida]], although some people may think he is a [[genie]] based on his [[earring]], folded arms, and tendency to appear magically at the appropriate time (one of the live-action commercials has a character directly refer to Mr. Clean as a genie). Hal Mason, the head animator at [[Cascade Studios]] in Hollywood, California modified the existing artwork in [[advertising|print advertising]] to be more readily used for the [[television commercial]]s written, produced, and directed by [[Thomas Scott Cadden]]. (Cadden also wrote the words and music for the original Mr. Clean jingle \u2014 see below.) The first actor to portray Mr. Clean in live action television commercials was [[House Peters Jr.]].\n\nIn a [[The New York Times|NY Times]] obituary for the original illustrator, [[Richard Black]], the product Mr. Clean was referenced to as the \"Genie in a bottle\"\n<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/business/richard-black-92-dies-first-illustrator-of-mr-clean.html|title=Richard Black, 92, Artist Who Conjured \u2018Mr. Clean,\u2019 Dies|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel E.|date=2014-04-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref>\n\nMr. Clean has always smiled, except for a brief time in the \"Mean Mr. Clean\" series of ads when he was frowning because he hated dirt. Although Mr. Clean is the strong, silent type, he did speak once in a few television commercials where actor [[Mark Dana]] appeared playing Mr. Clean in a [[suit-and-tie]] in the mid-1960s.\n\nMr. Clean's first name, Veritably, originated from a 'Give Mr. Clean a First Name' promotion in 1962.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/06/13/mf.real.names.fictional.characters/ Real names of 23 fictional characters]</ref>\n\nMr. Clean appeared on the September 2010 cover of ''[[Biz X]] Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=46105 |title=Biz X Magazine September 2010 |publisher=Bluetoad.com |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>\n\nMr. Clean was redesigned by [[Chase Design Group]].<ref>[http://www.chasedesigngroup.com/work/mr-clean/ Mr. Clean How do you convince a woman to pick up an aging bald man?]</ref>\n\nOn 2016-09-08, Procter & Gamble announced a contest to find the replacement Mr. Clean. The contest was introduced with a new 60-second spot with actor [[Kellan Lutz]] spoofing an audition reel for the Mr. Clean role that took place in August 2016 Los Angeles, California. In addition to casting sessions at 404 NYC in New York on 2016-09-07 and Envision Studios LA in Los Angeles on 2016-09-14, contestant could also submit video to contest web site. The contest winner would receive $20,000 in mid-October, and be featured in 2017 limited edition Mr. Clean calendar.<ref>[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/leo-burnetts-cheeky-new-work-mr-clean-kicks-search-new-face-173304 Cheeky New Work for Mr. Clean Kicks Off Search for a New Face Kellan Lutz wasn't quite right By Kristina Monllos]</ref><ref>[http://news.pg.com/press-release/pg-corporate-announcements/adding-multimedia-search-thenextmrclean ADDING MULTIMEDIA The Search is on for #TheNextMrClean]</ref>\n\n==Jingle==\nMr. Clean's theme song, or [[jingle]], has been around since the product's introduction, initially sung as a popular-music style duet between a man ([[Don Cherry (singer/golfer)|Don Cherry]]) and a woman ([[Betty Bryan]]). [[Thomas Scott Cadden]] wrote the jingle at his home in [[Skokie, Illinois]] in the spring of 1957 while working for Tatham-Laird & Kudner Advertising Agency. The vocal and piano recording was made on a home tape recorder for presentation to the agency and later to Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble approved the jingle in the spring or summer of 1957. Thomas Scott Cadden produced the recording of the jingle at Universal Recorders in Chicago in the summer or fall of 1957. Bill Walker was the arranger and Don Cherry and Betty Bryan were the singers. In January or February 1958, Cadden produced and wrote the first pool of television commercials&nbsp;\u2014 nine one-minute commercials and four 20-second \"lifts\". Included was the original full 60-second jingle commercial and the 10-second jingle \"tag\" at the end of all the others. They were produced at Cascade Pictures in Hollywood, California. The first pool of commercials ran in August 1958 at WDTV/KDKA in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] the year the product was introduced. The jingle is copyrighted under numbers EU 589219 & EU 599220. The jingle is also registered with [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] under title code 570098598 & 570006267.\n\nIn 2016, an updated reboot of the jingle was made for a [[television advertisement]]. It is the longest running advertising jingle used in television history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n'''Original lyrics by''' [[Thomas Scott Cadden]]''':'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-mr-clean-freshened-millennials-catchy-upgraded-jingle-172360|title=Ad of the Day: Mr. Clean Is Freshened Up for Millennials With a Catchy Upgraded Jingle|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n\nChorus:\n<br>\n''Mr. Clean gets rid of dirt and grime and grease in just a minute!''\n<br>\n''Mr. Clean will clean your whole house and everything that's in it!''\n<br>\nVerse 1:\n<br>\n''Floors, doors, walls, halls, white sidewall tires, and old golf balls!''\n<br>\n''Sinks, stoves, bathtubs he'll do, he'll even help clean laundry too!''\n<br>\n(Repeat Chorus)\n<br>\n''Q.

The first actor to portray Mr. Clean in live action television commercials was [[House Peters Jr.]].\n\nIn a [[The New York Times|NY Times]] obituary for the original illustrator, [[Richard Black]], the product Mr. Clean was referenced to as the \"Genie in a bottle\"\n<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/business/richard-black-92-dies-first-illustrator-of-mr-clean.html|title=Richard Black, 92, Artist Who Conjured \u2018Mr. Clean,\u2019 Dies|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel E.|date=2014-04-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref>\n\nMr. Clean has always smiled, except for a brief time in the \"Mean Mr. Clean\" series of ads when he was frowning because he hated dirt. Although Mr. Clean is the strong, silent type, he did speak once in a few television commercials where actor [[Mark Dana]] appeared playing Mr. Clean in a [[suit-and-tie]] in the mid-1960s.\n\nMr. Clean's first name, Veritably, originated from a 'Give Mr. Clean a First Name' promotion in 1962.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/06/13/mf.real.names.fictional.characters/ Real names of 23 fictional characters]</ref>\n\nMr. Clean appeared on the September 2010 cover of ''[[Biz X]] Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=46105 |title=Biz X Magazine September 2010 |publisher=Bluetoad.com |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>\n\nMr. Clean was redesigned by [[Chase Design Group]].<ref>[http://www.chasedesigngroup.com/work/mr-clean/ Mr. Clean How do you convince a woman to pick up an aging bald man?]</ref>\n\nOn 2016-09-08, Procter & Gamble announced a contest to find the replacement Mr. Clean.

[[Thomas Scott Cadden]] wrote the jingle at his home in [[Skokie, Illinois]] in the spring of 1957 while working for Tatham-Laird & Kudner Advertising Agency. The vocal and piano recording was made on a home tape recorder for presentation to the agency and later to Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble approved the jingle in the spring or summer of 1957. Thomas Scott Cadden produced the recording of the jingle at Universal Recorders in Chicago in the summer or fall of 1957. Bill Walker was the arranger and Don Cherry and Betty Bryan were the singers. In January or February 1958, Cadden produced and wrote the first pool of television commercials&nbsp;\u2014 nine one-minute commercials and four 20-second \"lifts\". Included was the original full 60-second jingle commercial and the 10-second jingle \"tag\" at the end of all the others. They were produced at Cascade Pictures in Hollywood, California. The first pool of commercials ran in August 1958 at WDTV/KDKA in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] the year the product was introduced. The jingle is copyrighted under numbers EU 589219 & EU 599220. The jingle is also registered with [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] under title code 570098598 & 570006267.\n\nIn 2016, an updated reboot of the jingle was made for a [[television advertisement]]. It is the longest running advertising jingle used in television history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n'''Original lyrics by''' [[Thomas Scott Cadden]]''':'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-mr-clean-freshened-millennials-catchy-upgraded-jingle-172360|title=Ad of the Day: Mr. Clean Is Freshened Up for Millennials With a Catchy Upgraded Jingle|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n\nChorus:\n<br>\n''Mr. Clean gets rid of dirt and grime and grease in just a minute!''\n<br>\n''Mr. Clean will clean your whole house and everything that's in it!''\n<br>\nVerse 1:\n<br>\n''Floors, doors, walls, halls, white sidewall tires, and old golf balls!''\n<br>\n''Sinks, stoves, bathtubs he'll do, he'll even help clean laundry too!''\n<br>\n(Repeat Chorus)\n<br>\n''Q.

He was also a [[television presenter]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Attimis]], a ''[[comune]]'' in the province of [[Udine]], [[Italy]]. Croatto's family moved to the border town of [[La Paz, Canelones|La Paz, Uruguay]] when he was 9 years old. While being raised as a [[carpenter]], [[lumberjack]] and [[farmer]], music was very much a part of his household. In 1959, at 19, he created his first [[pop music]] group with his brother Edelweiss (nicknamed \"Tim\") and his sister Argentina (nicknamed \"Nelly\") which was named \"[[Los TNT|TNT]]\". The group came about at Nelly's insistence; since their mother frowned upon the idea of Nelly (who was 15 years old at the time and adamantly wanted to become a singer) touring solo, she would only allow her to sing in public with her brothers as a backup group. The group eventually developed a very strong following, first in [[Uruguay]], then [[Argentina]], then in [[Spain]], where TNT moved as their popularity soared.<ref name=\"PRPOP\">https://prpop.org/biografias/tony-croatto/</ref>\n\n===The TNT Years===\n[[File:LosTNT.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Tony Croatto, with his sister and brother when they were [[Los TNT]] (1960). Tony is the first one from below.]]\nTNT were renowned for their vocal [[harmony|harmonies]], their onstage chemistry and Nelly's voice and magnetic personality. At the time, Tony stated once, he was happy with just singing background and playing guitar, claiming he was rather shy. Eventually, he developed a strong stage presence, which allowed him to take over vocal duties occasionally.\n\nIn 1960, TNT recorded a song, ''\"Eso, eso, eso\"'', written by [[tango music|tango]] composers Virgilio and Homero Exp\u00f3sito, for [[RCA Records]], which sold more than 100,000 copies in that country alone. They were part of the first broadcast ever by Argentina's television station, Canal 9, their personal appearances were solidly attended, and their popularity ensured the success of a media campaign they did for the Argentine [[brewery|brewer]], [[Cerveza Quilmes]]. Their group was also popular in [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Per\u00fa]], [[Chile]] and [[Mexico]], where they eventually toured. Their [[LP album|LP]] records for [[RCA-Victor]] were fast sellers all over [[Latin America]]. They even appeared in a movie, ''\"Fiebre de Juventud\"'', along with Mexican pop idol [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]], in 1962.\n\nAfter attaining some success in Spain, TNT moved there in 1963. They went as far as representing the country in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964]] in [[Copenhagen]], billed as \"Nelly, Tim and Tony\". Tony stated once that the group was handpicked by the powers that be behind [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]], the Spanish state television, to substitute that year's winners in the Spanish classification round, Michel and Teresa Mar\u00eda, popular Spanish singers of the time. TVE toned down their normally dynamic act for the contest, in which they sang what was originally a slow ballad, ''\"Caracola\"'' (written by Spanish songwriter Fina de Calder\u00f3n). Tony and his siblings suspected that this was a disaster waiting to happen. Disappointed by their twelfth-place finish in the competition, and the subsequent reaction in Spain, their willingness to tour and record there diminished with time. They moved back to Argentina in 1965. Tim eventually left the group in 1966 and returned to his native Italy to become a concert promoter.\n\n===Nelly and Tony's move to Puerto Rico===\n\nThe music pairing of Nelly and Tony then became a [[Duet (music)|duo]]. In 1968, after travelling across [[South America]] and spending two years in [[Venezuela]] (his then-wife [[Raquel Montero]] was an Argentine-born [[telenovela]] actress, whose good looks and dramatic talent were popular in the country; their mutual children [[Mara Croatto|Mara]] and [[Alejandro Croatto]] were born there). Tony moved to what would eventually become his adoptive homeland, Puerto Rico, when ''\"Nelly y Tony\"'' were hired by Puerto Rican promoter [[Alfred D. Herger]] to appear on his popular youth television shows. \"Nelly y Tony\" would perform together until 1974, when Nelly married a Puerto Rican [[surgeon]]. She retired from pop music and eventually moved to the [[United States]] (she currently lives in [[Redlands, California]]).\n\nWhile performing with his sister Nelly in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Teatro Puerto Rico]] in 1973, Tony was introduced to New York-bred but Puerto Rico-born vocalist [[Roberto Tirado]]<ref>Tirado, Roberto (2006). \"The Chosen Journey: A Memoir\". Trafford Publishing.  {{ISBN|141209614-6}}.</ref> who suggested that he compose a hit song for his idol [[Lucecita Ben\u00edtez]], who was going through hard times in her career. Tony obliged, and with poet David Ortiz, wrote her number one career refreshing hit, \"Soy De Una Raza Pura.\" That would be the only song that Lucecita Ben\u00edtez would claim as her opening song for many years later on.\n\nWhile he was almost as successful in Puerto Rico singing pop tunes with his sister as he was in other countries, Tony Croatto was very much impressed by Puerto Rican [[j\u00edbaro]] singers, who could improvise [[d\u00e9cima]]s on the spot, something that reminded him of the [[Music of Argentina|payadores]] of Uruguay and Argentina he used to listen to when he was growing up. He also found a richness in musical traditions in Puerto Rico that, he claimed, was extremely rare elsewhere in Latin America. He started singing Puerto Rican folk songs with Nelly, and noticed that their pop treatment of these songs was far more in demand that the pop material they would normally sing together. He was also well impressed by the Puerto Rican people, who \u2014 he claimed \u2014 treated him better on his first night on the island than what he had experienced touring extensively in a country or two. That, plus various personal reasons, persuaded him to stay in Puerto Rico for good; he even went as far as saying he was a \"born again Puerto Rican.\" Montero also made Puerto Rico her permanent residence, even after divorcing Croatto later on.\n\n===The Haciendo Punto years===\nCroatto then formed [[Haciendo Punto en Otro Son]], a group famous for its songs (particularly [[protest songs]]), which were composed and arranged in the \"[[Nueva Trova]]\" tradition. He joined Puerto Rican singers [[Silverio P\u00e9rez]], Josy Latorre, Irvin Garc\u00eda, and Nano Cabrera. ''\"Haciendo Punto\"'' was quite heterogeneous: P\u00e9rez's strength was in j\u00edbaro music, Latorre was a classically trained singer, Cabrera was a rocker and Garc\u00eda was also a strong [[Salsa music|salsa]] percussionist and singer, but Croatto's vast experience with pop music (in the opinion of P\u00e9rez) made all the difference in the group's success. Croatto was instrumental in both the musical and technical aspects of the group, not only as singer, guitarist and keyboardist, but also as arranger, producer and studio technician. In fact, he founded a record label at the time, named ''Artomax'', which was financed by local singer [[Chucho Avellanet]] and local producer Tom\u00e1s Figueroa.\n\n===Tony goes solo===\nHis first solo record, featuring both [[synthesizer]]s and Puerto Rican folk instruments, was well received by the public at large. Since then he was well regarded for his interpretations of Puerto Rican folk music, which spanned over thirty albums.\n\nCroatto worked in Puerto Rico by remaking old Puerto Rican standards such as the [[plena]] standard ''\"La M\u00e1quina\"'' (\"The Train's Engine\") and a medley of plenas by [[C\u00e9sar Concepci\u00f3n]], both rearranged as pop songs. He made also an adaptation of ''\"El Cocuy Que Alumbra\" ('The [[Firefly]] That Shines')'' from the Venezuelan [[parranda]] band Un Solo Pueblo, which was renamed ''\"A Correr Sabana\"'' once set to new lyrics written by salsa composer [[Tite Curet Alonso]]. Curet and Croatto wrote another firefly song together, this time an original named ''Cucubano'' (the song was also versioned by the Puerto Rican [[boy band]], [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]).\n\nIn 1985, Croatto recorded ''El Ni\u00f1ito Jes\u00fas'' (aka ''\"Se llama Jes\u00fas\"''), released during the [[Winter holiday season#Shopping|Christmas season]], which told about a poor and hungry child, named Jes\u00fas (a thinly-veiled reference to the [[Christ child]]), with wornout pants and no shoes, who walked into a house of well-doers begging for attention, while the people in the household rejected him, first euphemistically, then rather openly.\n\nCroatto divorced Montero and married former singer, actress (and later children television hostess) Glorivee (Gloria Esther Viera Pantojas) in 1979. His son Hermes Gabriel Croatto Viera was born during his marriage to Glorivee. Croatto was identified himself as a Roman Catholic, although he could not participate fully in church rituals given his status as a divorced man. In part as a way to compensate for this and contribute to his faith he wrote a j\u00edbaro [[mass (Catholic Church)|mass]], which gave him one of his latter hits, ''\"Creo en Dios\"'' (\"I believe in God\").\n\nCroatto recorded musical versions of poems and lullabies written by [[Georgina L\u00e1zaro]], a Puerto Rican poet whose works were mostly intended for children.\n\nGlorivee had a bout with brain cancer, from which she successfully recovered. Croatto eventually divorced Glorivee and married Lillian Arroyo. He eventually moved to Carolina where he spent his later years.\n\n===\"''Desde Mi Pueblo''\"===\n\nParallel to his singing career, Croatto also became a presenter on ''\"Desde mi pueblo\"'' (\"From My Town\"), a variety show / weekly documentary that aired weekly on [[WIPR-TV]]. His co-hosts were local comedian Luis Antonio Rivera ([[Yoyo Boing]]), the former  [[Miss Universe 1985]], [[Deborah Carthy Deu]] and Mar\u00eda Falc\u00f3n. The program's concept involved traveling to a different municipality of Puerto Rico every week and highlighting all cultural aspects found in each town. Given the fact that Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities, there was enough material to show and research over the program's six-year run. Carthy is on record stating that Croatto was genuinely interested in researching each program carefully, and became far more knowledgeable about Puerto Rican culture than most of the program's producers, co-hosts and film crew. Because of his background as a farmer, Croatto was very much interested in local agricultural issues; he jumped at trying local folklore, particularly j\u00edbaro music, [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[plena]] variations that were unique to each town or region, \"sometimes fearlessly\", said Rivera once. In 1983 Croatto had also a kind of TV cultural show on [[Telemundo]] (Puerto Rico) called Tony Croatto Y Tu Pueblo (Tony Croatto And Your Town]].\n\n===Achievements===\n\nCroatto's daughter, [[Mara Croatto]], born in [[Venezuela]], is a famous actress, who considers herself Puerto Rican.\n\nIn 2000, the City of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] proclaimed him as its adoptive son. [http://www.lmsj.org/ra/2000-01/R2000-0164.pdf#search='tony%20croatto' See proclamation].\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nCroatto, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed on March 2005 with lung and brain [[cancer]].  He refused medical treatment, opting for natural treatments instead. He expected his health to eventually improve, but probably was not aware of how sick he was, since his death came just three weeks after the announcement. Croatto dictated a letter published in local papers to notify the public of his illness and leave a message of gratitude to the people of Puerto Rico who adopted him as son and patriot.\n\nAfter requesting to be released from the hospital to spend his last days with his family, Croatto died on April 3, 2005. His fellow former Haciendo Punto bandmates had staged a benefit concert for him the night before, which was filmed for later release on a [[DVD]]. As a gift from them, the production company provided a live audio feed to what would become Croatto's deathbed; it has been stated that Croatto smiled when the band requested a standing ovation to him, just before losing consciousness for the last time. His funeral was held at the [[Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique\u00f1a]] (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture) and he was given a [[state funeral]]. Thousands of Puerto Ricans paid their respects and later accompanied the funeral procession en route to his burial in [[Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]] located in Old San Juan.\n\nHe will always be remembered for how he rekindled and boosted in Puerto Ricans the love for their country, their nature, and the ''\"j\u00edbaro\"'' concept, without political colors nor beliefs.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Biography|Music}}\n*[[List of Puerto Ricans]]\n*[[Puerto Rican Songwriters]]\n*[[Music of Puerto Rico]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://haciendopunto.com Haciendo Punto en Otro Son]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croatto, Tony}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]]\n[[Category:People from Attimis]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Deaths from brain tumor]]\n[[Category:Deaths from lung cancer]]\n[[Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1964]]\n[[Category:Italian emigrants to Argentina]]\n[[Category:People from Canelones Department]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican composers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican male composers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican guitarists]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican male singers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican singers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Spanish Eurovision Song Contest entrants]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan composers]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan guitarists]]\n[[Category:Male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan male singers]]\n[[Category:Italian expatriates in Uruguay]]\n[[Category:Italian emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Italian musician who interpreted Puerto Rican folk music}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2010}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name = Tony Croatto\n|image =\n|image_size =240\n|caption = Tony Croatto Cantando\n|background = solo_singer\n|birth_name = Hermes Davide Fastino Croatto Martinis\n|Also_known_as= \n|birth_date = {{Birth date|1940|3|2}}\n|death_date = {{death date and age|mf=yes|2005|4|3|1940|3|2}}\n|origin = [[Udine|Udine, Italy]]\n|death_place = [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]]\n|instrument = Guitar\n|genre = Puerto Rican Folk Music\n|occupation = Singer\n|years_active = \n|label =\n\n|website = \n}}\n\n'''Hermes Davide Fastino Croatto Martinis''', better known as '''Tony Croatto''' (March 2, 1940, some sources state his year of birth as 1939 \u2013 April 3, 2005) was an Italian singer and [[composer]] best known for his interpretations of Puerto Rican folk music.

Trafford Publishing.  {{ISBN|141209614-6}}.</ref> who suggested that he compose a hit song for his idol [[Lucecita Ben\u00edtez]], who was going through hard times in her career. Tony obliged, and with poet David Ortiz, wrote her number one career refreshing hit, \"Soy De Una Raza Pura.\" That would be the only song that Lucecita Ben\u00edtez would claim as her opening song for many years later on.\n\nWhile he was almost as successful in Puerto Rico singing pop tunes with his sister as he was in other countries, Tony Croatto was very much impressed by Puerto Rican [[j\u00edbaro]] singers, who could improvise [[d\u00e9cima]]s on the spot, something that reminded him of the [[Music of Argentina|payadores]] of Uruguay and Argentina he used to listen to when he was growing up. He also found a richness in musical traditions in Puerto Rico that, he claimed, was extremely rare elsewhere in Latin America. He started singing Puerto Rican folk songs with Nelly, and noticed that their pop treatment of these songs was far more in demand that the pop material they would normally sing together. He was also well impressed by the Puerto Rican people, who \u2014 he claimed \u2014 treated him better on his first night on the island than what he had experienced touring extensively in a country or two. That, plus various personal reasons, persuaded him to stay in Puerto Rico for good; he even went as far as saying he was a \"born again Puerto Rican.\" Montero also made Puerto Rico her permanent residence, even after divorcing Croatto later on.\n\n===The Haciendo Punto years===\nCroatto then formed [[Haciendo Punto en Otro Son]], a group famous for its songs (particularly [[protest songs]]), which were composed and arranged in the \"[[Nueva Trova]]\" tradition. He joined Puerto Rican singers [[Silverio P\u00e9rez]], Josy Latorre, Irvin Garc\u00eda, and Nano Cabrera. ''\"Haciendo Punto\"'' was quite heterogeneous: P\u00e9rez's strength was in j\u00edbaro music, Latorre was a classically trained singer, Cabrera was a rocker and Garc\u00eda was also a strong [[Salsa music|salsa]] percussionist and singer, but Croatto's vast experience with pop music (in the opinion of P\u00e9rez) made all the difference in the group's success. Croatto was instrumental in both the musical and technical aspects of the group, not only as singer, guitarist and keyboardist, but also as arranger, producer and studio technician. In fact, he founded a record label at the time, named ''Artomax'', which was financed by local singer [[Chucho Avellanet]] and local producer Tom\u00e1s Figueroa.\n\n===Tony goes solo===\nHis first solo record, featuring both [[synthesizer]]s and Puerto Rican folk instruments, was well received by the public at large. Since then he was well regarded for his interpretations of Puerto Rican folk music, which spanned over thirty albums.\n\nCroatto worked in Puerto Rico by remaking old Puerto Rican standards such as the [[plena]] standard ''\"La M\u00e1quina\"'' (\"The Train's Engine\") and a medley of plenas by [[C\u00e9sar Concepci\u00f3n]], both rearranged as pop songs. He made also an adaptation of ''\"El Cocuy Que Alumbra\" ('The [[Firefly]] That Shines')'' from the Venezuelan [[parranda]] band Un Solo Pueblo, which was renamed ''\"A Correr Sabana\"'' once set to new lyrics written by salsa composer [[Tite Curet Alonso]]. Curet and Croatto wrote another firefly song together, this time an original named ''Cucubano'' (the song was also versioned by the Puerto Rican [[boy band]], [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]).\n\nIn 1985, Croatto recorded ''El Ni\u00f1ito Jes\u00fas'' (aka ''\"Se llama Jes\u00fas\"''), released during the [[Winter holiday season#Shopping|Christmas season]], which told about a poor and hungry child, named Jes\u00fas (a thinly-veiled reference to the [[Christ child]]), with wornout pants and no shoes, who walked into a house of well-doers begging for attention, while the people in the household rejected him, first euphemistically, then rather openly.\n\nCroatto divorced Montero and married former singer, actress (and later children television hostess) Glorivee (Gloria Esther Viera Pantojas) in 1979. His son Hermes Gabriel Croatto Viera was born during his marriage to Glorivee. Croatto was identified himself as a Roman Catholic, although he could not participate fully in church rituals given his status as a divorced man. In part as a way to compensate for this and contribute to his faith he wrote a j\u00edbaro [[mass (Catholic Church)|mass]], which gave him one of his latter hits, ''\"Creo en Dios\"'' (\"I believe in God\").\n\nCroatto recorded musical versions of poems and lullabies written by [[Georgina L\u00e1zaro]], a Puerto Rican poet whose works were mostly intended for children.\n\nGlorivee had a bout with brain cancer, from which she successfully recovered. Croatto eventually divorced Glorivee and married Lillian Arroyo. He eventually moved to Carolina where he spent his later years.\n\n===\"''Desde Mi Pueblo''\"===\n\nParallel to his singing career, Croatto also became a presenter on ''\"Desde mi pueblo\"'' (\"From My Town\"), a variety show / weekly documentary that aired weekly on [[WIPR-TV]]. His co-hosts were local comedian Luis Antonio Rivera ([[Yoyo Boing]]), the former  [[Miss Universe 1985]], [[Deborah Carthy Deu]] and Mar\u00eda Falc\u00f3n. The program's concept involved traveling to a different municipality of Puerto Rico every week and highlighting all cultural aspects found in each town. Given the fact that Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities, there was enough material to show and research over the program's six-year run. Carthy is on record stating that Croatto was genuinely interested in researching each program carefully, and became far more knowledgeable about Puerto Rican culture than most of the program's producers, co-hosts and film crew. Because of his background as a farmer, Croatto was very much interested in local agricultural issues; he jumped at trying local folklore, particularly j\u00edbaro music, [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[plena]] variations that were unique to each town or region, \"sometimes fearlessly\", said Rivera once. In 1983 Croatto had also a kind of TV cultural show on [[Telemundo]] (Puerto Rico) called Tony Croatto Y Tu Pueblo (Tony Croatto And Your Town]].\n\n===Achievements===\n\nCroatto's daughter, [[Mara Croatto]], born in [[Venezuela]], is a famous actress, who considers herself Puerto Rican.\n\nIn 2000, the City of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] proclaimed him as its adoptive son. [http://www.lmsj.org/ra/2000-01/R2000-0164.pdf#search='tony%20croatto' See proclamation].\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nCroatto, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed on March 2005 with lung and brain [[cancer]].  He refused medical treatment, opting for natural treatments instead. He expected his health to eventually improve, but probably was not aware of how sick he was, since his death came just three weeks after the announcement. Croatto dictated a letter published in local papers to notify the public of his illness and leave a message of gratitude to the people of Puerto Rico who adopted him as son and patriot.\n\nAfter requesting to be released from the hospital to spend his last days with his family, Croatto died on April 3, 2005. His fellow former Haciendo Punto bandmates had staged a benefit concert for him the night before, which was filmed for later release on a [[DVD]]. As a gift from them, the production company provided a live audio feed to what would become Croatto's deathbed; it has been stated that Croatto smiled when the band requested a standing ovation to him, just before losing consciousness for the last time. His funeral was held at the [[Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique\u00f1a]] (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture) and he was given a [[state funeral]]. Thousands of Puerto Ricans paid their respects and later accompanied the funeral procession en route to his burial in [[Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]] located in Old San Juan.\n\nHe will always be remembered for how he rekindled and boosted in Puerto Ricans the love for their country, their nature, and the ''\"j\u00edbaro\"'' concept, without political colors nor beliefs.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Biography|Music}}\n*[[List of Puerto Ricans]]\n*[[Puerto Rican Songwriters]]\n*[[Music of Puerto Rico]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://haciendopunto.com Haciendo Punto en Otro Son]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croatto, Tony}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]]\n[[Category:People from Attimis]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Deaths from brain tumor]]\n[[Category:Deaths from lung cancer]]\n[[Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1964]]\n[[Category:Italian emigrants to Argentina]]\n[[Category:People from Canelones Department]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican composers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican male composers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican guitarists]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican male singers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican singers]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Spanish Eurovision Song Contest entrants]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan composers]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan guitarists]]\n[[Category:Male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan male singers]]\n[[Category:Italian expatriates in Uruguay]]\n[[Category:Italian emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "name_user": "The Eloquent Peasant", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography:named ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Croatto"}

Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century.{{cn|date=February 2020}} There was a shift of focus in the early twentieth century to the synchronic approach (the systemic study of the current stage in languages), but historical research remained a field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields include [[language change]] and [[grammaticalisation]] studies.\n\nWestern modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7486-4601-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].\n\nAt first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\">\"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics.\" In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref>  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\" /> The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.\n\nSome scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5\u201327}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.\n\n=== Syntax and morphology===\n{{main|Syntax|Morphology (linguistics)}}\nSyntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and [[morphemes]]. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes\u2014sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes\u2014and how they may be combined to form words.\n\nWhile words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] \"-s\", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\"free\" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] [\"Mandarin\"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.\n\n[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=& Apel, K.|date=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405\u201332|doi=10.1177/1086296x15619730}}</ref>\n\n[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \"t\u0259mey\u014b\u0259levtp\u0259\u03b3t\u0259rk\u0259n\", for example, meaning \"I have a fierce headache\", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-\u0259-mey\u014b-\u0259-levt-p\u0259\u03b3t-\u0259-rk\u0259n'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.\n\nThe discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].\n\n=== Semantics and pragmatics ===\n{{main|Semantics|Pragmatics}}\nSemantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided by the role of linguistic and social context in the determination of meaning. Semantics in this conception is concerned with core meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].<ref name=Mey>Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).</ref> Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or \"coded\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge ([[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Shaozhong\n |first       = Liu\n |title       = What is pragmatics?\n |url         = http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |accessdate  = 18 March 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307222541/http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |archivedate = 7 March 2009\n}}\n</ref> In that respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent [[ambiguity]] since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.<ref name=Mey/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pragmatics-language-1691654|title=What Is Pragmatics?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{{main|Phonetics|Phonology}}\nPhonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sound= \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0648\u0627\u062a such as their acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.\n\n== Language varieties ==\n{{see|Variety (linguistics)}}\nLanguages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as [[linguistic register]]s, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of [[language genesis]].\n\n=== Contact varieties ===\n{{see|Creolistics}}\nContact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. [[Pidgin]]s are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. [[Creole language]]s are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill [[lexical gap|gaps]] in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language.\n\nNot all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of [[colonization]] and [[slavery|enslavement]], where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the [[substrate language]], while the dominant language serves as the [[superstrate]]. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the [[lexifier]], while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Selbach|first=Rachel|year=2008|chapter=The superstrate is not always the lexi\ufb01er: Lingua Franca in the Barbary Coast 1530\u20141830|title=Roots of creole structures: Weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|volume=33|series=Creole Language Library|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialect ===\nA dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]</ref> The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English with an accent: Language, ideology and discrimination in the United States|last=Lippi-Green|first=Rosina|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}} Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that \"[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]\" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].\n\n<blockquote>\"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&nbsp;\u2013 they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes.\"<ref>Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Standard language===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a [[standard variety]], one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of [[speech community]] participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.\n\n===Relativity===\nAs constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings, especially about[[deconstructivism|deconstruction]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|url=https://archive.org/details/writingdifferenc00derr_0|title=Writing and Difference|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-226-14329-3|translator=Alan Bass|url-access=registration}}</ref> have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Structures==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nLinguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning \"cat\" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the [[knowledge engineering]] field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.\n\nLinguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word \"tenth\" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word \"tenth\" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker \"th\" follows the number \"ten.\"  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the \"n\" sound in \"tenth\" is made differently from the \"n\" sound in \"ten\" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of \"tenth\", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound<ref>All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.</ref> as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linguistics |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51370-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121214215844/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2012 |edition=6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A.

As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level.

Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the \"medical discourse\", and so on.\n\n===Lexicon===\nThe [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-1723-2 |pages=2ff}}</ref> and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.\n\nIt is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.\n\n===Style===\n[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title=\"Stylistics\" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]], for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.<ref>[[Writing and Difference]] by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and [[Of Grammatology]]</ref> [[Palaeography]] is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.<ref>Chapter 1, section 1.1 in {{cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Runes and Germanic Linguistics|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn =978-3-11-017462-5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC |edition= 6th |author=Elmer H.

In the humanistic reference, the terms [[structuralism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional [[explanation]] entails the idea that language is a tool for [[communication]], or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the binary or multilayered language system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dane\u0161 |first=Franti\u0161ek |editor-last=Dirven |editor-first=R. | editor-last2=Fried |editor-first2=V. | title=Functionalism in Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |date=1987 |pages=3\u201338 |chapter=On Prague school functionalism in linguistics |isbn= 9789027215246|author-link= Franti\u0161ek Dane\u0161}}</ref>\n\n===Biological===\n\nOther linguistics frameworks take as their starting point the notion that language is a [[Biological phenomena|biological phenomenon]] in humans.

This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is \"better\" or \"worse\" than another.\n\n[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or \"[[acrolect]]\". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in [[language education|language instruction]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.\n\n===Anthropology===\nThe objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, linguistic inquiry now uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.\n\n===Sources===\nMost contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because\n* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;\n* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;\n* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;\n* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;\n* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].\n\nNonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.\n\nThe study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.\n\n===Analysis===\nBefore the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.\n\nAt another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article \"the\" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of linguistics}}\n\n===Nomenclature===\nBefore the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,<ref name=\"Etymonline Definition of Philology\">{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}</ref> was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.<ref name= \"Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G.

P\u0101\u1e47ini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0648}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.</ref> but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word \"[[grammar]]\" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as \"[[Art of Grammar|t\u00e9chn\u0113 grammatik\u1e17]]\" ({{script|Grek|\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}}), the \"art of writing\", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A.

The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:<ref name=\"Bloomfield 1914 311\"/>\n\n<blockquote>This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''\u00dcber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einflu\u00df auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').</blockquote>\n\n===20th century developments===\n\nThere was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, [[Louis Hjelmslev]]; and [[Zellig Harris]] who also developed methods of [[discourse analysis]]. Functional analysis was developed by the [[Prague linguistic circle]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]]. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the [[audio-lingual method]] provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of [[language universals]] in [[linguistic typology]]. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of [[language technology]] and digitalised [[corpus linguistics|corpora]].\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Ecolinguistics===\n[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}</ref>\n\n===Sociolinguistics===\n[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.\n\n===Developmental linguistics===\n[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.\n\n===Neurolinguistics===\n[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mari\u00ebn|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101\u201303|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Applied linguistics===\n{{Main|Applied linguistics}}\nLinguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and \"applies\" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. \"Applied linguistics\" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-437444-6}}</ref> Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally \"applying\" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)\n\nToday, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide [[voice interface]]s to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.\n\nLinguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\">{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503\u201326 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}</ref> This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/>\n\n===Semiotics===\n[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of \"sign\" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204\u201325 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}</ref> These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.\n\n===Language documentation===\n\n[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] \u2013 the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.\n\nSince the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.\n\nThe emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.<ref>Himmelman, Nikolaus \"Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?\" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York.</ref>\n\n===Translation===\nThe sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]], which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.\n\n===Biolinguistics===\n[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.\n\n===Clinical linguistics===\nClinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat [[communication disorders|communication]] and swallowing disorders.\n\nChaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded \"looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day.\" The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'\n\nHowever, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.<ref>Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Computational linguistics===\n[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is \"computationally responsible\", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.\n\n===Evolutionary linguistics===\n[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219\u201334  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n===Forensic linguistics===\n[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases.\n\n==See also==\n<!--Alphabetical please-->\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2016}}\n{{portal|Linguistics|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anthroponymy]]\n* [[Articulatory phonology]]\n* [[Articulatory synthesis]]\n* [[Asemic writing]]\n* [[Axiom of categoricity]]\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Critical discourse analysis]]\n* [[Cryptanalysis]]\n* [[Decipherment]]\n* [[Global language system]]\n* [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)]]\n* [[Index of linguistics articles]]\n* [[Integrational linguistics]]\n* [[Integrationism]]\n* [[Intercultural competence]]\n* [[International Congress of Linguists]]\n* [[International Linguistics Olympiad]]\n* [[Language attrition]]\n* [[Language engineering]]\n* [[Language geography]]\n* [[Linguistic typology]]\n* [[List of departments of linguistics]]\n* [[List of summer schools of linguistics]]\n* [[Metacommunicative competence]]\n* [[Microlinguistics]]\n* [[Onomastics]]\n* [[Outline of linguistics]]\n* [[Reading (process)|Reading]]\n* {{Section link|Rhythm|Linguistics}}\n* [[Speaker recognition]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Stratificational linguistics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | title=Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication | publisher=The MIT Press |author1=Akmajian, Adrian |author2=Demers, Richard |author3=Farmer, Ann |author4=Harnish, Robert | year=2010 | location=Cambridge, MA | isbn=978-0-262-51370-8}}\n\n* {{cite book | title=The handbook of linguistics | publisher=Blackwell |editor1=Aronoff, Mark |editor2=Rees-Miller, Janie | year=2000 | location=Oxford | isbn=}}\n\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|title=An Introduction to the Study of Language: New edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MN3YkwOgNYC&pg=PA307|year=1983|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-272-8047-3|orig-year=1914}}\n\n* {{cite book |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |title=On Language |year=1998 |publisher=The New Press, New York |isbn=978-1-56584-475-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/onlanguagechomsk00chom }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Derrida | title=Of Grammatology | year=1967 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn=978-0-8018-5830-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/ofgrammatology00derr }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Hall | title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics.

Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century.{{cn|date=February 2020}} There was a shift of focus in the early twentieth century to the synchronic approach (the systemic study of the current stage in languages), but historical research remained a field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields include [[language change]] and [[grammaticalisation]] studies.\n\nWestern modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7486-4601-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].\n\nAt first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\">\"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics.\" In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref>  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\" /> The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.\n\nSome scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5\u201327}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.\n\n=== Syntax and morphology===\n{{main|Syntax|Morphology (linguistics)}}\nSyntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and [[morphemes]]. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes\u2014sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes\u2014and how they may be combined to form words.\n\nWhile words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] \"-s\", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\"free\" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] [\"Mandarin\"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.\n\n[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=& Apel, K.|date=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405\u201332|doi=10.1177/1086296x15619730}}</ref>\n\n[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \"t\u0259mey\u014b\u0259levtp\u0259\u03b3t\u0259rk\u0259n\", for example, meaning \"I have a fierce headache\", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-\u0259-mey\u014b-\u0259-levt-p\u0259\u03b3t-\u0259-rk\u0259n'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.\n\nThe discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].\n\n=== Semantics and pragmatics ===\n{{main|Semantics|Pragmatics}}\nSemantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided by the role of linguistic and social context in the determination of meaning. Semantics in this conception is concerned with core meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].<ref name=Mey>Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).</ref> Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or \"coded\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge ([[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Shaozhong\n |first       = Liu\n |title       = What is pragmatics?\n |url         = http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |accessdate  = 18 March 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307222541/http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |archivedate = 7 March 2009\n}}\n</ref> In that respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent [[ambiguity]] since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.<ref name=Mey/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pragmatics-language-1691654|title=What Is Pragmatics?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{{main|Phonetics|Phonology}}\nPhonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.\n\n== Language varieties ==\n{{see|Variety (linguistics)}}\nLanguages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as [[linguistic register]]s, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of [[language genesis]].\n\n=== Contact varieties ===\n{{see|Creolistics}}\nContact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. [[Pidgin]]s are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. [[Creole language]]s are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill [[lexical gap|gaps]] in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language.\n\nNot all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of [[colonization]] and [[slavery|enslavement]], where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the [[substrate language]], while the dominant language serves as the [[superstrate]]. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the [[lexifier]], while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Selbach|first=Rachel|year=2008|chapter=The superstrate is not always the lexi\ufb01er: Lingua Franca in the Barbary Coast 1530\u20141830|title=Roots of creole structures: Weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|volume=33|series=Creole Language Library|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialect ===\nA dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]</ref> The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English with an accent: Language, ideology and discrimination in the United States|last=Lippi-Green|first=Rosina|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}} Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that \"[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]\" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].\n\n<blockquote>\"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&nbsp;\u2013 they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes.\"<ref>Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Standard language===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a [[standard variety]], one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of [[speech community]] participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.\n\n===Relativity===\nAs constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings, especially about[[deconstructivism|deconstruction]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|url=https://archive.org/details/writingdifferenc00derr_0|title=Writing and Difference|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-226-14329-3|translator=Alan Bass|url-access=registration}}</ref> have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Structures==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nLinguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning \"cat\" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the [[knowledge engineering]] field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.\n\nLinguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word \"tenth\" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word \"tenth\" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker \"th\" follows the number \"ten.\"  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the \"n\" sound in \"tenth\" is made differently from the \"n\" sound in \"ten\" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of \"tenth\", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound<ref>All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.</ref> as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linguistics |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51370-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121214215844/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2012 |edition=6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A.

As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level.

Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the \"medical discourse\", and so on.\n\n===Lexicon===\nThe [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-1723-2 |pages=2ff}}</ref> and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.\n\nIt is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.\n\n===Style===\n[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title=\"Stylistics\" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}</ref> diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well.

In the humanistic reference, the terms [[structuralism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional [[explanation]] entails the idea that language is a tool for [[communication]], or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the binary or multilayered language system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dane\u0161 |first=Franti\u0161ek |editor-last=Dirven |editor-first=R. | editor-last2=Fried |editor-first2=V. | title=Functionalism in Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |date=1987 |pages=3\u201338 |chapter=On Prague school functionalism in linguistics |isbn= 9789027215246|author-link= Franti\u0161ek Dane\u0161}}</ref>\n\n===Biological===\n\nOther linguistics frameworks take as their starting point the notion that language is a [[Biological phenomena|biological phenomenon]] in humans.

This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is \"better\" or \"worse\" than another.\n\n[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or \"[[acrolect]]\". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in [[language education|language instruction]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.\n\n===Anthropology===\nThe objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, linguistic inquiry now uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.\n\n===Sources===\nMost contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because\n* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;\n* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;\n* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;\n* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;\n* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].\n\nNonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.\n\nThe study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.\n\n===Analysis===\nBefore the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.\n\nAt another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article \"the\" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of linguistics}}\n\n===Nomenclature===\nBefore the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,<ref name=\"Etymonline Definition of Philology\">{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}</ref> was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.<ref name= \"Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G.

P\u0101\u1e47ini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0648}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.</ref> but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word \"[[grammar]]\" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as \"[[Art of Grammar|t\u00e9chn\u0113 grammatik\u1e17]]\" ({{script|Grek|\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}}), the \"art of writing\", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A.

The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:<ref name=\"Bloomfield 1914 311\"/>\n\n<blockquote>This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''\u00dcber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einflu\u00df auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').</blockquote>\n\n===20th century developments===\n\nThere was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, [[Louis Hjelmslev]]; and [[Zellig Harris]] who also developed methods of [[discourse analysis]]. Functional analysis was developed by the [[Prague linguistic circle]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]]. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the [[audio-lingual method]] provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of [[language universals]] in [[linguistic typology]]. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of [[language technology]] and digitalised [[corpus linguistics|corpora]].\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Ecolinguistics===\n[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}</ref>\n\n===Sociolinguistics===\n[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.\n\n===Developmental linguistics===\n[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.\n\n===Neurolinguistics===\n[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mari\u00ebn|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101\u201303|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Applied linguistics===\n{{Main|Applied linguistics}}\nLinguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and \"applies\" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. \"Applied linguistics\" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-437444-6}}</ref> Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally \"applying\" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)\n\nToday, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide [[voice interface]]s to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.\n\nLinguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\">{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503\u201326 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}</ref> This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/>\n\n===Semiotics===\n[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of \"sign\" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204\u201325 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}</ref> These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.\n\n===Language documentation===\n\n[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] \u2013 the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.\n\nSince the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.\n\nThe emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.<ref>Himmelman, Nikolaus \"Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?\" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York.</ref>\n\n===Translation===\nThe sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]], which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.\n\n===Biolinguistics===\n[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.\n\n===Clinical linguistics===\nClinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat [[communication disorders|communication]] and swallowing disorders.\n\nChaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded \"looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day.\" The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'\n\nHowever, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.<ref>Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Computational linguistics===\n[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is \"computationally responsible\", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.\n\n===Evolutionary linguistics===\n[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219\u201334  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n===Forensic linguistics===\n[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases.\n\n==See also==\n<!--Alphabetical please-->\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2016}}\n{{portal|Linguistics|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anthroponymy]]\n* [[Articulatory phonology]]\n* [[Articulatory synthesis]]\n* [[Asemic writing]]\n* [[Axiom of categoricity]]\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Critical discourse analysis]]\n* [[Cryptanalysis]]\n* [[Decipherment]]\n* [[Global language system]]\n* [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)]]\n* [[Index of linguistics articles]]\n* [[Integrational linguistics]]\n* [[Integrationism]]\n* [[Intercultural competence]]\n* [[International Congress of Linguists]]\n* [[International Linguistics Olympiad]]\n* [[Language attrition]]\n* [[Language engineering]]\n* [[Language geography]]\n* [[Linguistic typology]]\n* [[List of departments of linguistics]]\n* [[List of summer schools of linguistics]]\n* [[Metacommunicative competence]]\n* [[Microlinguistics]]\n* [[Onomastics]]\n* [[Outline of linguistics]]\n* [[Reading (process)|Reading]]\n* {{Section link|Rhythm|Linguistics}}\n* [[Speaker recognition]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Stratificational linguistics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | title=Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication | publisher=The MIT Press |author1=Akmajian, Adrian |author2=Demers, Richard |author3=Farmer, Ann |author4=Harnish, Robert | year=2010 | location=Cambridge, MA | isbn=978-0-262-51370-8}}\n\n* {{cite book | title=The handbook of linguistics | publisher=Blackwell |editor1=Aronoff, Mark |editor2=Rees-Miller, Janie | year=2000 | location=Oxford | isbn=}}\n\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|title=An Introduction to the Study of Language: New edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MN3YkwOgNYC&pg=PA307|year=1983|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-272-8047-3|orig-year=1914}}\n\n* {{cite book |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |title=On Language |year=1998 |publisher=The New Press, New York |isbn=978-1-56584-475-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/onlanguagechomsk00chom }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Derrida | title=Of Grammatology | year=1967 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn=978-0-8018-5830-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/ofgrammatology00derr }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Hall | title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics.
