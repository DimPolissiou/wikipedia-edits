Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000.\n\n[[File:Versatile 856 designation 6.jpg|thumb|left|A Versatile 856 tractor in Carrollton, Ohio]]\n[[Daniel Pakosh]] also developed the first bi-directional tractor in the world. The Versatile 150 launched in 1977.\n\nThe Versatile brand, known historically for four-wheel drive tractors, has expanded to include front-wheel assist tractors, self-propelled sprayers, precision seeding & tillage equipment, and combines.\n\nFour-wheel drive demand increased significantly, with Versatile becoming one of the leaders in four-wheel drive development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of four-wheel drive tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150. They entered the race to build the largest tractor in the world with \"Big Roy\", named after one of the founders, in 1977. Roy produced 600 HP on the draw bar.\n\nIn 1987, Versatile sold out to Ford, who later merged with New-Holland. After the acquisition of Versatile, Ford replaced the colors with their iconic Ford tractor blue. Along with this, the decals were replaced with the Ford name as well. Through out Versatile's time under Ford-New Holland, various changes and updates were made to the line. Two of the most notable changes were the transition from the flat square sheetmetal, to a more rounded and modernized design, and the additon of a powershift transmission.\n\nAfter the merger creating CNH, Versatile was then sold to Buhler Industries Incorporated, returning the iconic red to the tractors, but replacing yellow with white.\n\nOn November 1, 2007, Combine manufacturer [[Rostselmash]] Inc. acquired 80% of the common shares of Versatile and it was announced that the Versatile brand name will again be the sole name associated with the tractor division.\n\n<br />\n\n== Models ==\n\n=== 4 Wheel Drives (Articulated) ===\n\n\n* D100-1966 \n\n* G100 -1966\n* 118 1967-71 (118 HP)\n* 125 1967-68 (125 HP)\n* 145 1967-71 (145 HP)\n* 700 1972-77 (210 HP)\n* 900 1972-77 (300 HP)\n* 300- 1973 (155 HP)\n* 800 1973-77 (235 HP)\n* 850 1973-77 (250 HP)\n* 150 1977-81 (71 HP)\n* 500 1977-79 (192 HP)\n* 825- 1977 (250 HP) \n* 950 1977-82 (350 HP)\n* 1080- 1977 (600 HP)\n* 835 1978-84 (230 HP)\n* 855 1978-83 (250 HP)\n* 875 1978-84 (280 HP)\n* 555 1979-84 (210 HP)\n* 895 1980-84 (310 HP)\n* 1150 1981-85 (470 HP)\n* 160 1982-83 (84 HP)\n\n=== 2 Wheel Drives ===\n\n==References==\n* ''Versatile Tractors (A Farmer Boy's Dream)'', by Jarrod Pakosh, published by Japonica Press, {{ISBN|1-55046-416-7}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Versatile tractors}}\n* {{official website|http://www.versatile-ag.com}}\n* [http://www.versatile-ag.ca Versatile Tractor Brand]\n*http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/tractor-brands/versatile/versatile-tractors.html\n\n[[Category:Tractor manufacturers of Canada]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1966]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Canadian brands]]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Canada-company-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name = Buhler Versatile Incorporated\n| logo = \n| fate = \n| successor = \n| foundation = 1966 \n| defunct = \n| location = 1260 Clarence Avenue, [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] [[Canada]]\n| parent = [[Cornat Industries Incorporated]] 1977\u20131987 <br> [[Ford]]-[[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] / [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] 1987\u20132000 <br> [[Buhler Industries|Buhler Industries Incorporated]] 2000\u20132007 <br> [[Rostselmash|Combine Factory Rostselmash Ltd.]] 2007\u2013present\n| subsid = \n}}\n\n[[Image:Unveiling a new Versatile D118.jpg|thumb|Peter Pakosh, (third from right) and Roy Robinson (second from right), unveil a new Versatile D118 at a plant expansion ceremony in 1967.]]\n\n'''Versatile''' is a Canadian brand of agricultural equipment that has produced [[auger (drill)|auger]]s, [[swather]]s, and [[combine harvesters]].\nIn the 1960s, it was an independent operation, founded by [[Peter Pakosh]] and Roy Robinson, that had 70% of the 4WD tractor market.\n\nVersatile was the first company to mass-produce articulated four-wheel drive tractors, starting in 1966 with the D100 and G100 four-wheel drives. Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000.\n\n[[File:Versatile 856 designation 6.jpg|thumb|left|A Versatile 856 tractor in Carrollton, Ohio]]\n[[Daniel Pakosh]] also developed the first bi-directional tractor in the world. The Versatile 150 launched in 1977.\n\nThe Versatile brand, known historically for four-wheel drive tractors, has expanded to include front-wheel assist tractors, self-propelled sprayers, precision seeding & tillage equipment, and combines.\n\nFour-wheel drive demand increased significantly, with Versatile becoming one of the leaders in four-wheel drive development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of four-wheel drive tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150. They entered the race to build the largest tractor in the world with \"Big Roy\" , named after one of the founders, in 1977. Roy produced 600 HP on the drawbar.\n\nIn 1987, Versatile sold out to Ford, who later merged with New-Holland. After the acquisition of Versatile, Ford replaced the colors with their iconic Ford tractor blue. Along with this, the decals were replaced with the Ford name as well. Through out Vesatile's time under Ford-New Holland, various changes and updates were made to the line. Two of the most notable changes were the transition from the flat square sheetmetal, to a more rounded and modernized design, and the additon of a powershift transmission.\n\nAfter the merger creating CNH, Verstile was then sold to Fuhler Indistries Incorporated, returning the iconic red to the tractors, but replacing yellow with white.\n\nOn November 1, 2007, Combine manufacturer [[Rostselmash]] Inc. acquired 80% of the common shares of Versatile and it was announced that the Versatile brand name will again be the sole name associated with the tractor division.\n\n<br />\n\n== Models ==\n\n=== 4 Wheel Drives (Articulated) ===\n\n\n* D100-1966 \n\n* G100 -1966\n* 118 1967-71 (118 HP)\n* 125 1967-68 (125 HP)\n* 145 1967-71 (145 HP)\n* 700 1972-77 (210 HP)\n* 900 1972-77 (300 HP)\n* 300- 1973 (155 HP)\n* 800 1973-77 (235 HP)\n* 850 1973-77 (250 HP)\n* 150 1977-81 (71 HP)\n* 500 1977-79 (192 HP)\n* 825- 1977 (250 HP) \n* 950 1977-82 (350 HP)\n* 1080- 1977 (600 HP)\n* 835 1978-84 (230 HP)\n* 855 1978-83 (250 HP)\n* 875 1978-84 (280 HP)\n* 555 1979-84 (210 HP)\n* 895 1980-84 (310 HP)\n* 1150 1981-85 (470 HP)\n* 160 1982-83 (84 HP)\n\n=== 2 Wheel Drives ===\n\n==References==\n* ''Versatile Tractors (A Farmer Boy's Dream)'', by Jarrod Pakosh, published by Japonica Press, {{ISBN|1-55046-416-7}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Versatile tractors}}\n* {{official website|http://www.versatile-ag.com}}\n* [http://www.versatile-ag.ca Versatile Tractor Brand]\n*http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/tractor-brands/versatile/versatile-tractors.html\n\n[[Category:Tractor manufacturers of Canada]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1966]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Canadian brands]]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Canada-company-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Wood Geek", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatile_(company)"}
