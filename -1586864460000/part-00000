The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California.

Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters.

The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the&nbsp;ocean.<ref name=ssbsterg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161%2C3581553 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle booster stage to be solid-fuel, reusable vehicle |date=March 15, 1972 |page=3A}}</ref> In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle,<ref name=odsp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tNhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3326%2C897997|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=President okays spacecraft plan|date=January 5, 1972 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=bsspgpa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4846%2C1764562 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Big Space Shuttle proposal gets presidential approval |date=January 6, 1972 |page=1}}</ref> and NASA decided on its final design in&nbsp;March.<ref name=ssbsterg/> That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing.

The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']].

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist himself, earning the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also runs petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzles]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father dies six months later; Jimmy cries inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy runs into trouble with the police when he drunkenly defecates on a man's car in front of the man's children. Chuck gets him out of trouble, but requires that he work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, when Chuck believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] and becomes housebound, Jimmy begins bringing him groceries and running errands. \n\nJimmy befriends [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school. He passes the [[bar exam]] and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched panel doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor esteem of himself at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, he had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\".

They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road. Jimmy is eventually able to contact Kim, having earlier not had cell phone signal; he and Mike return to Albuquerque and Jimmy deposits Lalo's bail money. Jimmy lies to Lalo that the delay was because his car broke down, not divulging details of the shootout or Mike's involvement. In the aftermath of the desert ordeal, Jimmy experience symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]], but does not tell Kim the full details of what transpired in the desert. She finds his mug which was struck by a bullet during a shootout, but does not ask Jimmy about it. Lalo, intending to return to Mexico, finds Jimmy's discarded car and returns to Albuquerque to confront Jimmy. Jimmy maintains his story, adding additional details when pressed but still not mentioning the shootout. Lalo eventually leaves the apartment following a tirade from Kim, who berates Lalo over enlisting Jimmy to collect his money.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist himself, earning the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also runs petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzles]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father dies six months later; Jimmy cries inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy runs into trouble with the police when he drunkenly defecates on a man's car in front of the man's children. Chuck gets him out of trouble, but requires that he work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, when Chuck believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] and becomes housebound, Jimmy begins bringing him groceries and running errands. \n\nJimmy befriends [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school. He passes the [[bar exam]] and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched panel doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor esteem of himself at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, he had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\".

They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck that he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store, out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill. Saul is a skilled attorney who successfully defends numerous clients, aided by his fluent [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but also engages in questionable and sometimes illegal activities. He routinely dresses in loud, gaudy colors, and now routinely drives a [[Cadillac DeVille]].<ref name=\"esquire car\"/> Saul has established an office in a strip mall, adorned with tacky advertising inside and out, including a large [[inflatable]] [[Statue of Liberty]] balloon.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/standard-of-review-nothing-was-better-than-this-season-of-better-call-saul/|title=Standard Of Review: Nothing Was Better Than This Season Of 'Better Call Saul'|last=Graff|first=Harry|work=Above the Law|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>  He has ties to [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), the owner of the \"Los Pollos Hermanos\" fast-food chicken franchise around Albuquerque which he uses as a front to smuggle drugs from the Mexican cartel, and who is in direct competition with the Salamanca drug ring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/13/better-call-saul-amazon-prime|title=Better Call Saul: a methodical look at what causes a man to become a cockroach|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|date=April 13, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/standard-of-review-if-you-like-breaking-bad-you-better-watch-better-call-saul/|title=Standard Of Review: If You Like 'Breaking Bad,' You Better Watch 'Better Call Saul'|last=Graff|first=Harry|work=Above the Law|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Until the final episodes of ''Breaking Bad'', Saul continues to have the same go-lucky attitude shown in ''Better Call Saul'', mainly interested in profiting while other characters are concerned with life and death.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Karl|last=Puschmann|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11831566|title=Bob Odenkirk on drugs, violence and becoming Saul Goodman|date=April 6, 2017|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter their employee Badger ([[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]]) is arrested in an Albuquerque Police sting operation, meth cooks [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]) and [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]) hire Saul as their lawyer and ''[[consigliere]]''. Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

The city itself has gone through a process of modernization, but most of the surrounding area remains agricultural. Mirpur is known for its grand buildings and large bungalows, primarily funded through its [[expatriate]] community, which comes mainly from [[Europe]] (especially the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Hong Kong]], the [[Middle East]], and North America. The main crop cultivated during summer is [[millet]] and pulses. However, other crops such as wheat, maize and vegetables are also grown.  The produce of quality rice from the paddy fields of [[Khari Sharif]], between Upper Jhelum Canal and [[Jhelum]] river, is very famous and popular for its aroma and taste. The production of electricity from [[Mangla Dam]] provides the energy needs for Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Punjab.\n\nA significant portion of the population from the district, the [[Mirpuri diaspora]], migrated to the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1950s and in the early 1960s, mostly to [[West Yorkshire]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[Luton]], [[Peterborough]], [[Derby]] and [[East London]]. Mirpur is thus sometimes known as \"Little England\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17156238 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=How city of Mirpur became 'Little England' |first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |date=March 5, 2012 |quote=The city of Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is known as \"Little England\" due to its large British Pakistani community.}}</ref> Many British products are found, and many shops in the city accept the [[pound sterling]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17249424 | work=BBC News | title=Inside Pakistan's 'Little Britain' as overseas nationals get vote | date=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\nThe area that is now Mirpur has always been a crossroad for major invasions of [[South Asia]], and has formed part of various empires over time including the role of an outlying region of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]], the [[Mauryan Empire]], the [[Kushan]] empire, the [[Sultanate]] of Ghazni, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal empire]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe city of Mirpur itself was founded in around 1640 AD or 1050AH by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi. The Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series Kashmir and Jammu (1909) reports that \"it is said to have been founded by Miran Shah Ghazi and Sultan Fateh Khan\". An alternate view is that the city was founded by Mira Shah Gazi and Gosain Bodhpuri, both regarded as saints. The word 'Mir' was taken from the name of the former and 'Pur\u2019 from the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdfajk.org/Azad%20Kashmir%20and%20independencepolitics.pdf|title=Azad Kashmir - Kashmiri Development Foundation|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. He conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints, whose [[dargah]]s dot its landscape\n\nThe area that is now Mirpur has been historically associated with [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar]], though the modern demarcation of [[Potohar]] devised by the British excludes Mirpur, by using the [[Jhelum]] river as its eastern boundary. By the end of the 18th century, Gakhar power in Pothohar had declined. Mirpur had become part of Chibb, which ruled the state of Khari Khariyali with its capital at Mangla Fort. With the rise of the Sikh power in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] established his supremacy and set his eyes on the Chibh states of Bhimber and Khari Khariyali. In 1810, a force was sent against Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber and was met with fierce resistance. However, in 1812 another Sikh army under prince [[Kharak Singh]] defeated Sultan [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the [[Bhimber]] state was annexed as Jagir of Kharak Singh. Around the same time, Ranjit Singh acquired Gujrat and invaded Khari Khariyali, then ruled by Raja Umar Khan. Raja Umar Khan made peace with Ranjit Singh; but before a settlement could be made, he died, and the state and Mirpur became part of Ranjit Singh's territories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933</ref>\n\nIn 1808, Ranjit Singh annexed Jammu state, which was already a tributary since 1780, and in 1820 awarded Jammu to his commander [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Gulab Singh]], who hailed from Jammu and had been under the service of Ranjit Singh for the past eight years. Between 1831\u201339 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the royalty of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the northern Punjab towns including [[Bhera]], [[Jhelum]], [[Rohtas, Pakistan|Rohtas]], Mirpur and [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. Gulab Singh kept on expanding his kingdom, and in 1840 Baltistan was made subject to Jammu while Gilgit fell to a Sikh force from Kashmir in 1842. The state of Kashmir was annexed by Ranjit Singh in 1819. However, the rebellion in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] in the beginning of 1846 compelled the country to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu as well.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shrine of Meeran Shah-001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shrine of Meeran Shah]] -->\nAs an aftermath of the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Treaty of Lahore]], The [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] was signed between the British East India company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu on March 16, 1846. The British Government sold Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu for 75 lakhs Nanak Shahi Rupees. This treaty transferred him all the hill states between Ravi and Indus. The transfer included Kashmir, Hazara and the southern hill states (including former Khari Khariyali Thus sealing the fate of Mirpur with the new state of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Early Mirpur===\nSince Mirpur lies in between where the [[Jhelum River]] meets the heavily forested foothills of the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]] mountains and above the plains of the largely treeless Punjab, it was an ideal spot for the construction of the boats used to carry goods from the Himalayas down the five rivers of the Punjab to the [[Indus River]] and onto the seaports in the Indus delta. Traders have been operating from there across the [[Indian Ocean]] for over three thousand years. Most of the crew on the boats trading up and down the Punjab and Indus River system were drawn from Mirpur, as training as a boat-builder was a necessary prerequisite for becoming a boatman.<ref>{{citation |last=Ballard |first=Roger |chapter=The South Asian presence in Britain and its transnational connections |title=Culture and economy in the Indian diaspora |year=2003 |pp=197\u2013222 |chapter-url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/250/1/southasianbritain.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===British Dominion===\nDuring the modern period of the Dogra principality, a British dominion, the thriving river trade diminished due to the construction of railway lines from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Karachi]] into the interior of the Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Moving goods by modern rail lines was both cheaper and quicker, and hundreds of Mirpuri boatmen found themselves out of a job.\n\nAt the same time long-distance ocean trade was shifting from sail to steam. There was a huge demand for men who were prepared to work in the hot, dirty and dangerous stokeholds of the new coal-fired steamers. British seamen avoided such jobs whenever they possibly could.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} They preferred to work on deck. But in the 1870s Mirpuri ex-river boatmen  were desperately searching for a new source of income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Although unfamiliar with stoking coal-fired boilers, they were prepared to learn and quickly gained jobs as engine-room stokers on new steamships sailing out of Karachi and Bombay, a position they retained until coal-fired ships were finally phased out of service at the end of the Second World War. Many Mirpuris also fought in the Indian Army in Burma during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter World War II, a new set of opportunities opened up. Britain's economy was just starting what proved to be a long postwar boom, and there was an acute short of labour in the foundries of the [[English Midlands]] and in the textile mills of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Now it was the turn of ex-seamen to become industrial workers in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1960, when the Mangla Dam was about to be constructed, those who were going to be deprived of their agricultural land were afforded the opportunity to migrate to the United Kingdom and to join their relatives, who long established themselves in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAlthough one major reason for the outflow was the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], but long before the construction of dam, a sizable Mirpuri community already existed in the UK.\n\n==Mirpur City ==\n\nMirpur City is at 459 m above sea level and is linked with the main [[Peshawar]]-[[Lahore]] Grand Trunk Road at [[Dina (town)|Dina Tehsil]]. It is the headquarters of Mirpur District, which has two subdivisions: Mirpur and Dadyal. Mirpur is now one of the largest city of Azad Kashmir.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027084826/http://www.geocities.com/sam4mobile/Dadyal-Thumbnail-view.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine].

The project of four-star hotel PC has been completed. The government is planning to make the second rotating hotel of Pakistan in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir.\n\nIn fact, the remains of the old city (Old Mirpur) are under the waters of the Mangla Lake, bit during the colder months of March and April, the water level recedes to such an extent that one can travel on motorcycle on the old Mirpur, road which still exists. The holy shrines of Syed Abdul Karim and Meeran Shah Ghazi then become visible and so do the remnants of a Sikh [[gurdwara]] as well as a Hindu [[Hindu temple|Mandir]], possibly dedicated to the \"Mangla Mata\" (Mangla mother goddess). The remains of old houses, water wells and graveyards reappear as well.\n\nPeople from surrounding areas visit old Mirpur to pay homage to their ancient land on which they lived and pray on the graveyards of their loved ones. Urs Mubarak of Meeran Shah and Syed Abdul Kareem are also arranged in Old Mirpur.\n\nThe remains of Old Mirpur depict a silhouette of pre-[[Partition of India|Independence]] city, when many faiths coexisted. However, after division of the State of Jammu Kashmir, the non-Muslim community (Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) fled to Jammu.\n\nNew Mirpur was well planned, and modern buildings and ample roads serve each part of city. The affluence from emigration mainly to the UK is reflected by the structure and grandiose of the residential houses. There are telltale signs of inward investment by the expatriate community living in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the [[Middle East]]. There are a number of good hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other urban facilities.\n\n==Agriculture==\nMost of the area's bushy landscapes, stretching from Bhimber to Dadyal, are barren, leaving only a small stretch of fertile land but there is highly-productive land near water. One crop cultivated during the spring/summer season is millet. Also, a few farms grow vegetables and wheat, especially when the dam water subsides during the winter season.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully developed Mirpur industrially and promoted private investment in a diverse economy: [[foam]], polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable oil (ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, [[cosmetics]], [[marble]], ready-made garments, matches and rosin, [[turpentine]]. The economy of Mirpur generated economy of Azad Kashmir. However, much of the infrastructure still needs improvement so that high-quality products can be obtained.\n\nAs part of the relief/compensation package in the wake of Mangla Dam, a new city is being developed along the southeastern outskirts of Mirpur, with the main city of Mirpur being doubled. Much construction is occurring around the whole district by Pakistani and Chinese contractors, raising the dam. Four towns in the district have been planned near the new city to resettle the population affected by the project.\n\n==Education ==\n[[English language|English]] is common in educational institutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Previously, the [[University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir]] was the only institution for higher studies but there have been significant changes in the educational infrastructure. The [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology]] (MUST), the [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology#Akson College of Health Sciences|Akson College of Health Science]] and the [[Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Medical College]] have been formed.\n\nThe [[AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mirpur]] is responsible for the studies at lower levels. In addition to the state-run schools and colleges, Mirpur has a well-developed private sector providing the education to all sections of the society:\n\nOther notable colleges and schools include:\n<!-- ONLY ADD A NAME TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HAS A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n* [[The City School (Pakistan)|The City School]]\n* [[Mohi ud Din Islamic Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences]]\n* [[Mohi-ud-Din Islamic Medical College]]\n* [[Punjab College]], Mirpur\n\n== Media ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2019}}\nElectronic and print media are rapidly increasing in number. There are many daily newspaper published in Mirpur.\n\n== Sport ==\n\nFootball, cricket and volleyball are popular in Mirpur. Mirpur has a cricket stadium, [[Quaid-e-Azam Stadium]].\n\nThere are registered sports clubs:A-5 Cricket Club, Al-Siraj Cricket Club, South Asia Cricket Club, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club and Kashmir National FC.\n\nThe district football team of Mirpur take part in the All [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] football championships.\n\n==Transport==\n[[CNG]] auto rickshaws are very  popular mode of transport for short routes within the city. The city's transport system links it to a number of destinations in [[Azad Kashmir]] notably [[Bhimber]], Jatlan, [[Chakswari]], [[Dadyal]], [[Kotli]] and [[Khoi Ratta]] and to major cities in [[Pakistan]] as well as including services to [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Kharian]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Lahore]] and [[Rawalpindi]].\nThere is no railway station in Mirpur. The closest station is in Dina. The promise of a rail extension to Mirpur has not been fulfilled.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hib6DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT197&lpg=PT197&dq=promise+mirpur+railway#v=onepage&q=promise%20mirpur%20railway&f=false|title=Kashmir Dispute, Pakistan and the Un Resolutions|last=Choudhry|first=Dr Shabir|date=2017-01-18|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781524667818|language=en}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[Islamabad Airport]] which services the Mirpur region is 130&nbsp;km away.

Mirpur's original population comprises different tribes similar to that of Punjab. However, since 1947, Pahari people emigrated from the neighbouring [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]] and [[Poonch District (Azad Kashmir)|Poonch]] districts of the Indian administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

Refugees from Jhelum in Western Punjab had taken refuge in Mirpur town, causing the non-Muslim population to increase to 25,000. On 25 November 1947, tribesmen and Pakistani military members moved into the town, seizing the city. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to the Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The remainder were marched to Alibeg, where a gurdwara was converted into a prison camp, but the raiders killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women. Only about 5,000 made it to Alibeg, but they continued to be killed at a gradual pace by the captors. In March 1948, the [[ICRC]] rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Alibeg, who were resettled to [[Jammu]] and other areas of India. The date of 25 November is remembered as the ''Mirpur Day'' in the Indian-administered Kashmir.{{sfn|Snedden, Unwritten History|2013|p=56}}{{sfn|Puri, Across the Line of Control|2013|p=30}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khalidhasan.net/2007/03/16/mirpur-1947-%E2%80%93-the-untold-story/|title=Mirpur 1947 \u2013 the untold story|last=Hassan|first=Khalid|date=16 March 2007|publisher=Khalid Hasan Online|accessdate=2015-08-13|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928132633/http://www.khalidhasan.net/2007/03/16/mirpur-1947-%E2%80%93-the-untold-story/|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://udayindia.org/content_08may2010/statescan.html |last=Gupta |first=Prakriiti |title=Horrific Tales: Over 3,00,000 Hindus, Sikhs from PoK still fighting for their acceptance |newspaper=Uday India |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-13 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908063433/http://udayindia.org/content_08may2010/statescan.html |archivedate=September 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Raj Kumar |last=Bhagotra |chapter=Escape from death seven times |editor=Bal K.

The city itself has gone through a process of modernization, but most of the surrounding area remains agricultural. Mirpur is known for its grand buildings and large bungalows, primarily funded through its [[expatriate]] community, which comes mainly from [[Europe]] (especially the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Hong Kong]], the [[Middle East]], and North America. The main crop cultivated during summer is [[millet]] and pulses. However, other crops such as wheat, maize and vegetables are also grown.  The produce of quality rice from the paddy fields of [[Khari Sharif]], between Upper Jhelum Canal and [[Jhelum]] river, is very famous and popular for its aroma and taste. The production of electricity from [[Mangla Dam]] provides the energy needs for Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Punjab.\n\nA significant portion of the population from the district, the [[Mirpuri diaspora]], migrated to the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1950s and in the early 1960s, mostly to [[West Yorkshire]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[Luton]], [[Peterborough]], [[Derby]] and [[East London]]. Mirpur is thus sometimes known as \"Little England\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17156238 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=How city of Mirpur became 'Little England' |first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |date=March 5, 2012 |quote=The city of Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is known as \"Little England\" due to its large British Pakistani community.}}</ref> Many British products are found, and many shops in the city accept the [[pound sterling]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17249424 | work=BBC News | title=Inside Pakistan's 'Little Britain' as overseas nationals get vote | date=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\nThe area that is now Mirpur has always been a crossroad for major invasions of [[South Asia]], and has formed part of various empires over time including the role of an outlying region of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]], the [[Mauryan Empire]], the [[Kushan]] empire, the [[Sultanate]] of Ghazni, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal empire]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe city of Mirpur itself was founded in around 1640 AD or 1050AH by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi. The Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series Kashmir and Jammu (1909) reports that \"it is said to have been founded by Miran Shah Ghazi and Sultan Fateh Khan\". An alternate view is that the city was founded by Mira Shah Gazi and Gosain Bodhpuri, both regarded as saints. The word 'Mir' was taken from the name of the former and 'Pur\u2019 from the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdfajk.org/Azad%20Kashmir%20and%20independencepolitics.pdf|title=Azad Kashmir - Kashmiri Development Foundation|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. He conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints, whose [[dargah]]s dot its landscape\n\nThe area that is now Mirpur has been historically associated with [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar]], though the modern demarcation of [[Potohar]] devised by the British excludes Mirpur, by using the [[Jhelum]] river as its eastern boundary. By the end of the 18th century, Gakhar power in Pothohar had declined. Mirpur had become part of Chibb, which ruled the state of Khari Khariyali with its capital at Mangla Fort. With the rise of the Sikh power in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] established his supremacy and set his eyes on the Chibh states of Bhimber and Khari Khariyali. In 1810, a force was sent against Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber and was met with fierce resistance. However, in 1812 another Sikh army under prince [[Kharak Singh]] defeated Sultan [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the [[Bhimber]] state was annexed as Jagir of Kharak Singh. Around the same time, Ranjit Singh acquired Gujrat and invaded Khari Khariyali, then ruled by Raja Umar Khan. Raja Umar Khan made peace with Ranjit Singh; but before a settlement could be made, he died, and the state and Mirpur became part of Ranjit Singh's territories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933</ref>\n\nIn 1808, Ranjit Singh annexed Jammu state, which was already a tributary since 1780, and in 1820 awarded Jammu to his commander [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Gulab Singh]], who hailed from Jammu and had been under the service of Ranjit Singh for the past eight years. Between 1831\u201339 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the royalty of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the northern Punjab towns including [[Bhera]], [[Jhelum]], [[Rohtas, Pakistan|Rohtas]], Mirpur and [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. Gulab Singh kept on expanding his kingdom, and in 1840 Baltistan was made subject to Jammu while Gilgit fell to a Sikh force from Kashmir in 1842. The state of Kashmir was annexed by Ranjit Singh in 1819. However, the rebellion in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] in the beginning of 1846 compelled the country to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu as well.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shrine of Meeran Shah-001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shrine of Meeran Shah]] -->\nAs an aftermath of the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Treaty of Lahore]], The [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] was signed between the British East India company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu on March 16, 1846. The British Government sold Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu for 75 lakhs Nanak Shahi Rupees. This treaty transferred him all the hill states between Ravi and Indus.

Traders have been operating from there across the [[Indian Ocean]] for over three thousand years. Most of the crew on the boats trading up and down the Punjab and Indus River system were drawn from Mirpur, as training as a boat-builder was a necessary prerequisite for becoming a boatman.<ref>{{citation |last=Ballard |first=Roger |chapter=The South Asian presence in Britain and its transnational connections |title=Culture and economy in the Indian diaspora |year=2003 |pp=197\u2013222 |chapter-url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/250/1/southasianbritain.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===British Dominion===\nDuring the modern period of the Dogra principality, a British dominion, the thriving river trade diminished due to the construction of railway lines from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Karachi]] into the interior of the Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Moving goods by modern rail lines was both cheaper and quicker, and hundreds of Mirpuri boatmen found themselves out of a job.\n\nAt the same time long-distance ocean trade was shifting from sail to steam. There was a huge demand for men who were prepared to work in the hot, dirty and dangerous stokeholds of the new coal-fired steamers. British seamen avoided such jobs whenever they possibly could.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} They preferred to work on deck. But in the 1870s Mirpuri ex-river boatmen  were desperately searching for a new source of income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Although unfamiliar with stoking coal-fired boilers, they were prepared to learn and quickly gained jobs as engine-room stokers on new steamships sailing out of Karachi and Bombay, a position they retained until coal-fired ships were finally phased out of service at the end of the Second World War. Many Mirpuris also fought in the Indian Army in Burma during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter World War II, a new set of opportunities opened up. Britain's economy was just starting what proved to be a long postwar boom, and there was an acute short of labour in the foundries of the [[English Midlands]] and in the textile mills of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Now it was the turn of ex-seamen to become industrial workers in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1960, when the Mangla Dam was about to be constructed, those who were going to be deprived of their agricultural land were afforded the opportunity to migrate to the United Kingdom and to join their relatives, who long established themselves in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAlthough one major reason for the outflow was the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], but long before the construction of dam, a sizable Mirpuri community already existed in the UK.\n\n==Mirpur City ==\n\nMirpur City is at 459 m above sea level and is linked with the main [[Peshawar]]-[[Lahore]] Grand Trunk Road at [[Dina (town)|Dina Tehsil]]. It is the headquarters of Mirpur District, which has two subdivisions: Mirpur and Dadyal. Mirpur is now one of the largest city of Azad Kashmir.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027084826/http://www.geocities.com/sam4mobile/Dadyal-Thumbnail-view.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine].

The project of four-star hotel PC has been completed. The government is planning to make the second rotating hotel of Pakistan in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir.\n\nIn fact, the remains of the old city (Old Mirpur) are under the waters of the Mangla Lake, bit during the colder months of March and April, the water level recedes to such an extent that one can travel on motorcycle on the old Mirpur, road which still exists. The holy shrines of Syed Abdul Karim and Meeran Shah Ghazi then become visible and so do the remnants of a Sikh [[gurdwara]] as well as a Hindu [[Hindu temple|Mandir]], possibly dedicated to the \"Mangla Mata\" (Mangla mother goddess). The remains of old houses, water wells and graveyards reappear as well.\n\nPeople from surrounding areas visit old Mirpur to pay homage to their ancient land on which they lived and pray on the graveyards of their loved ones. Urs Mubarak of Meeran Shah and Syed Abdul Kareem are also arranged in Old Mirpur.\n\nThe remains of Old Mirpur depict a silhouette of pre-[[Partition of India|Independence]] city, when many faiths coexisted. However, after division of the State of Jammu Kashmir, the non-Muslim community (Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) fled to Jammu.\n\nNew Mirpur was well planned, and modern buildings and ample roads serve each part of city. The affluence from emigration mainly to the UK is reflected by the structure and grandiose of the residential houses. There are telltale signs of inward investment by the expatriate community living in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the [[Middle East]]. There are a number of good hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other urban facilities.\n\n==Agriculture==\nMost of the area's bushy landscapes, stretching from Bhimber to Dadyal, are barren, leaving only a small stretch of fertile land but there is highly-productive land near water. One crop cultivated during the spring/summer season is millet. Also, a few farms grow vegetables and wheat, especially when the dam water subsides during the winter season.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully developed Mirpur industrially and promoted private investment in a diverse economy: [[foam]], polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable oil (ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, [[cosmetics]], [[marble]], ready-made garments, matches and rosin, [[turpentine]]. The economy of Mirpur generated economy of Azad Kashmir. However, much of the infrastructure still needs improvement so that high-quality products can be obtained.\n\nAs part of the relief/compensation package in the wake of Mangla Dam, a new city is being developed along the southeastern outskirts of Mirpur, with the main city of Mirpur being doubled. Much construction is occurring around the whole district by Pakistani and Chinese contractors, raising the dam. Four towns in the district have been planned near the new city to resettle the population affected by the project.\n\n==Education ==\n[[English language|English]] is common in educational institutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Previously, the [[University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir]] was the only institution for higher studies but there have been significant changes in the educational infrastructure. The [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology]] (MUST), the [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology#Akson College of Health Sciences|Akson College of Health Science]] and the [[Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Medical College]] have been formed.\n\nThe [[AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mirpur]] is responsible for the studies at lower levels. In addition to the state-run schools and colleges, Mirpur has a well-developed private sector providing the education to all sections of the society:\n\nOther notable colleges and schools include:\n<!-- ONLY ADD A NAME TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HAS A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n* [[The City School (Pakistan)|The City School]]\n* [[Mohi ud Din Islamic Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences]]\n* [[Mohi-ud-Din Islamic Medical College]]\n* [[Punjab College]], Mirpur\n\n== Media ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2019}}\nElectronic and print media are rapidly increasing in number. There are many daily newspaper published in Mirpur.\n\n== Sport ==\n\nFootball, cricket and volleyball are popular in Mirpur. Mirpur has a cricket stadium, [[Quaid-e-Azam Stadium]].\n\nThere are registered sports clubs:A-5 Cricket Club, Al-Siraj Cricket Club, South Asia Cricket Club, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club and Kashmir National FC.\n\nThe district football team of Mirpur take part in the All [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] football championships.\n\n==Transport==\n[[CNG]] auto rickshaws are very  popular mode of transport for short routes within the city. The city's transport system links it to a number of destinations in [[Azad Kashmir]] notably [[Bhimber]], Jatlan, [[Chakswari]], [[Dadyal]], [[Kotli]] and [[Khoi Ratta]] and to major cities in [[Pakistan]] as well as including services to [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Kharian]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Lahore]] and [[Rawalpindi]].\nThere is no railway station in Mirpur. The closest station is in Dina.

Refugees from Jhelum in Western Punjab had taken refuge in Mirpur town, causing the non-Muslim population to increase to 25,000. On 25 November 1947, tribesmen and Pakistani military members moved into the town, seizing the city. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to the Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The remainder were marched to Alibeg, where a gurdwara was converted into a prison camp, but the raiders killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women. Only about 5,000 made it to Alibeg, but they continued to be killed at a gradual pace by the captors. In March 1948, the [[ICRC]] rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Alibeg, who were resettled to [[Jammu]] and other areas of India.

Mayor [[William Frederick Havemeyer|William Havemeyer]] shepherded the NYPD together, originating the phrase \"New York (City)'s Finest\".<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', May 13, 2017, p. C6</ref> In 1857, it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force, which abolished the Municipal Police. Twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption.\n\n==Rank structure==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nOfficers begin service with the rank of \"probationary police officer\", also referred to as \"recruit officer\". After successful completion of five and a half to six months (or sometimes more) of Police Academy training in various academic, physical, and tactical fields, officers graduate from the Police Academy. While graduates are referred to as \"police officers\", they officially continue to be \"probationary police officers\", or informally \"rookies\", until they have completed an additional 18 month probationary period.\n\nThere are three career \"tracks\" in the NYPD: supervisory, investigative, and specialist. The supervisory track consists of nine sworn titles, referred to as ranks. Promotion to the ranks of [[sergeant]], [[lieutenant]], and [[police captain|captain]] are made via competitive [[civil service]] examinations. After reaching the civil service rank of captain, promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector, inspector, deputy chief, assistant chief, (bureau) chief and chief of department is made at the discretion of the police commissioner. Promotion from the rank of police officer to [[detective]] is discretionary by the police commissioner or required by law when the officer has performed eighteen months or more of investigative duty.\n\nThe entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist. The commissioner may grant discretionary grades of second and finally first. These grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors. Specifically, a second grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a sergeant's and a first grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenant's. Detectives are police officers who usually perform investigatory duties but have no official supervisory authority. A \"detective first grade\" still falls under the command of a sergeant or above. Just like detectives, sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks.{{-}}\nJake peralta should be a captain\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Badge design\n!Badge color\n!Badge number\n!Uniform\n|-\n|[[Chief of police|Chief of Department]]\n|[[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Medallion with eagle and star(s)\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold, with silver star(s)\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|No\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|White shirt,<br />black [[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Bureau Chief<br/>Bureau Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020\nSupervising Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n|Assistant Chief<br/>Assistant Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Assistant Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n|Deputy Chief<br/>Deputy Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>District Surgeon\n|[[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n|[[Inspector#Municipal police|Inspector]]<br/>Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Police Surgeon\n|[[File:Colonel Gold-vector.svg|center|50px]]\n|Medallion with eagle<br/>(Chaplains have faith insignia overlaid)\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold\n|-\n|Deputy Inspector\n|[[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|center|30px]]\n|Laurels and crown with oak leaves\n|-\n|[[Police captain|Captain]]\n|[[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|Laurels and crown\n|-\n|[[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n|[[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|[[File:NYPD Lieutenant Badge.jpeg|130px]]\n|-\n|[[Sergeant#Police departments and prisons|Sergeant]]\n|[[File:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]] (sleeve)\n|[[File:NYPD_Sergeant_Badge.jpg|135px]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Detective (grades 3rd\u20131st)\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|[[File:Badge of a New York City Police Department detective.png|100px]]\n|-\n|[[Police Officer]]\n|rowspan=3|[[File:NYPD badge.png|100px]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Silver\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes,<br />matching hat badge\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />silver hat badge with matching number\n|-\n|Probationary Police Officer\n|-\n|Recruit Officer\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Slate grey,<br />black [[garrison cap]]\n|-\n|[[Cadet]]\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|}\n\n{{cnote|\u2020|Uniform rank that has no police powers}}\n\n[[File:New York Police Department officers.jpg|thumb|Officers from the Emergency Service Unit]]\n[[File:NYPD police boat, Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Brooklyn at sunset.JPG|thumb|Police boat patrolling the [[East River]]]]\n\nThere are two basic types of [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|detective in the NYPD]]: \"detective-investigators\" and \"detective-specialists\". Detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term \"detective\" and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies. Most police officers gain their detective title by working in the Narcotics Division of the Detective Bureau. Detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating [[murder]]s, [[rape]]s, [[robbery|robberies]], [[burglary|burglaries]] and other crimes within that precinct's boundaries.\n\nOther detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level, investigating [[terrorist group]]s, [[organized crime]], [[drug dealing|narcotics dealing]], [[extortion]], [[bias crime]]s, [[political corruption]], [[kidnapping]]s, major [[fraud]]s or [[theft]]s committed against banks or museums, [[police corruption]], contractor fraud and other complex, politically sensitive or high-profile cases. A squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the city's five [[district attorney|district attorneys']] offices.\n\nPromotion from \"police officer\" to \"detective-investigator\" is based on investigative experience. Typically, a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated \"detective-investigator\" and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation. In the recent past, however, there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title. Newly appointed detectives start at \"detective third grade\", which has a pay rate roughly between that of \"police officer\" and \"sergeant\". As they gain seniority and experience, they can be \"promoted\" to \"detective second-grade\", which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants. \"Detective first-grade\" is an elite designation for the department's most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants.\n\nAll these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted. While senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads, not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer. All detective grades still fall under the \"chain of command\" of the supervisory ranks beginning with \"sergeant\" through \"chief of department\". Detectives, like police officers, are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks.\n\n[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant debriefing officers at [[Times Square]]]]\n\nWhile carrying with them increased pay and prestige, none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority. Contrary to some media portrayals, there is no specific rank of \"detective sergeant\" or \"detective lieutenant\". Lieutenants and Sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors, and are responsible for all investigations. There is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of \"Sergeant\u2014Supervisor Detective Squad\" (SDS), or Lieutenant\u2014Commander Detective Squad (CDS) therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision. Their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank's pay grade, and similar to a detective's \"grade\", is also a discretionary promotion.\n\nThis pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units, i.e. [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|Detective Bureau]], Internal Affairs Bureau, Counter-Terrorism Bureau, and the [[New York City Police Department Intelligence Bureau|Intelligence Bureau]]. Lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment, pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts. \"Detective-specialists\" are a relatively new designation and one unique to the NYPD. In the 1980s, many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status, but were not being assigned to investigative duties. Examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor, police commissioner and other senior officials.\n\nTo remedy this situation, the rank of detective-specialist was created. These officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs, e.g., executive protection units, community affaires or NCO's, emergency service unit, sharpshooter, patrol instructor, helicopter instructor, etc. Like detective-investigators, detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status.\n\n[[File:NYPD police motorcycle.png|thumb|Motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby]]\n\nThe Department is administered and governed by the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner]], who is appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]]. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law.\n\nA Police Commissioner who comes up from the sworn ranks retains that status while serving as a police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm and retains the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioner's squad.\n\nThese individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department, and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, support services, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. Despite their role, as civilian administrators of the department, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the Commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations, however). Within the rank structure, there are also designations, known as \"grades\", that connote differences in duties, experience, and pay. However, supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above.\n\nBadges in the New York City Police Department are referred to as \"shields\" (the traditional term), though not all badge designs are strictly [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield-shaped]]. Every rank has a different badge design (with the exception of \"police officer\" and \"probationary police officer\"), and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge. Lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers, and tax registry number. Lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number. All sworn members of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a red background. Civilian employees of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a blue background, signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm. All ID cards have an expiration date.\n\n==Organization and structure==\n{{Main|Organization of the New York City Police Department}}\n[[File:NYPD One Police Plaza.JPG|thumb|[[1 Police Plaza]], NYPD HQ]]\n\n===Office of the Chief of Department===\nThe [[Chief of Police|Chief of Department]] serves as the senior sworn member of the NYPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/administration.shtml|title=NYPD Administration|work=nyc.gov}}</ref> [[Terence Monahan]] is the 40th individual to hold the post, which prior to 1987 was known as the chief of operations and before that as chief inspector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|title=NYPD - Administration|work=nyc.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920220513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|archivedate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Bureaus===\n{{convert to prose|date=January 2019}}\nThe Department is divided into twenty bureaus,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureaus|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/bureaus.page|website=New York Police Department|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> which are typically commanded by a uniformed bureau chief (such as the chief of patrol and the chief of housing) or a civilian deputy commissioner (such as the Deputy Commissioner of Information Technology).

Mayor [[William Frederick Havemeyer|William Havemeyer]] shepherded the NYPD together, originating the phrase \"New York (City)'s Finest\".<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', May 13, 2017, p. C6</ref> In 1857, it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force, which abolished the Municipal Police. Twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption.\n\n==Rank structure==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nOfficers begin service with the rank of \"probationary police officer\", also referred to as \"recruit officer\". After successful completion of five and a half to six months (or sometimes more) of Police Academy training in various academic, physical, and tactical fields, officers graduate from the Police Academy. While graduates are referred to as \"police officers\", they officially continue to be \"probationary police officers\", or informally \"rookies\", until they have completed an additional 18 month probationary period.\n\nThere are three career \"tracks\" in the NYPD: supervisory, investigative, and specialist. The supervisory track consists of nine sworn titles, referred to as ranks. Promotion to the ranks of [[sergeant]], [[lieutenant]], and [[police captain|captain]] are made via competitive [[civil service]] examinations. After reaching the civil service rank of captain, promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector, inspector, deputy chief, assistant chief, (bureau) chief and chief of department is made at the discretion of the police commissioner. Promotion from the rank of police officer to [[detective]] is discretionary by the police commissioner or required by law when the officer has performed eighteen months or more of investigative duty.\n\nThe entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist. The commissioner may grant discretionary grades of second and finally first. These grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors. Specifically, a second grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a sergeant's and a first grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenant's. Detectives are police officers who usually perform investigatory duties but have no official supervisory authority. A \"detective first grade\" still falls under the command of a sergeant or above. Just like detectives, sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks.{{-}}\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Badge design\n!Badge color\n!Badge number\n!Uniform\n|-\n|[[Chief of police|Chief of Department]]\n|[[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Medallion with eagle and star(s)\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold, with silver star(s)\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|No\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|White shirt,<br />black [[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Bureau Chief<br/>Bureau Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020\nSupervising Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n|Assistant Chief<br/>Assistant Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Assistant Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n|Deputy Chief<br/>Deputy Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>District Surgeon\n|[[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n|[[Inspector#Municipal police|Inspector]]<br/>Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Police Surgeon\n|[[File:Colonel Gold-vector.svg|center|50px]]\n|Medallion with eagle<br/>(Chaplains have faith insignia overlaid)\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold\n|-\n|Deputy Inspector\n|[[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|center|30px]]\n|Laurels and crown with oak leaves\n|-\n|[[Police captain|Captain]]\n|[[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|Laurels and crown\n|-\n|[[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n|[[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|[[File:NYPD Lieutenant Badge.jpeg|130px]]\n|-\n|[[Sergeant#Police departments and prisons|Sergeant]]\n|[[File:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]] (sleeve)\n|[[File:NYPD_Sergeant_Badge.jpg|135px]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Detective (grades 3rd\u20131st)\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|[[File:Badge of a New York City Police Department detective.png|100px]]\n|-\n|[[Police Officer]]\n|rowspan=3|[[File:NYPD badge.png|100px]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Silver\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes,<br />matching hat badge\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />silver hat badge with matching number\n|-\n|Probationary Police Officer\n|-\n|Recruit Officer\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Slate grey,<br />black [[garrison cap]]\n|-\n|[[Cadet]]\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|}\n\n{{cnote|\u2020|Uniform rank that has no police powers}}\n\n[[File:New York Police Department officers.jpg|thumb|Officers from the Emergency Service Unit]]\n[[File:NYPD police boat, Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Brooklyn at sunset.JPG|thumb|Police boat patrolling the [[East River]]]]\n\nThere are two basic types of [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|detective in the NYPD]]: \"detective-investigators\" and \"detective-specialists\". Detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term \"detective\" and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies. Most police officers gain their detective title by working in the Narcotics Division of the Detective Bureau. Detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating [[murder]]s, [[rape]]s, [[robbery|robberies]], [[burglary|burglaries]] and other crimes within that precinct's boundaries.\n\nOther detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level, investigating [[terrorist group]]s, [[organized crime]], [[drug dealing|narcotics dealing]], [[extortion]], [[bias crime]]s, [[political corruption]], [[kidnapping]]s, major [[fraud]]s or [[theft]]s committed against banks or museums, [[police corruption]], contractor fraud and other complex, politically sensitive or high-profile cases. A squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the city's five [[district attorney|district attorneys']] offices.\n\nPromotion from \"police officer\" to \"detective-investigator\" is based on investigative experience. Typically, a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated \"detective-investigator\" and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation. In the recent past, however, there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title. Newly appointed detectives start at \"detective third grade\", which has a pay rate roughly between that of \"police officer\" and \"sergeant\". As they gain seniority and experience, they can be \"promoted\" to \"detective second-grade\", which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants. \"Detective first-grade\" is an elite designation for the department's most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants.\n\nAll these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted. While senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads, not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer. All detective grades still fall under the \"chain of command\" of the supervisory ranks beginning with \"sergeant\" through \"chief of department\". Detectives, like police officers, are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks.\n\n[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant debriefing officers at [[Times Square]]]]\n\nWhile carrying with them increased pay and prestige, none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority. Contrary to some media portrayals, there is no specific rank of \"detective sergeant\" or \"detective lieutenant\". Lieutenants and Sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors, and are responsible for all investigations. There is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of \"Sergeant\u2014Supervisor Detective Squad\" (SDS), or Lieutenant\u2014Commander Detective Squad (CDS) therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision. Their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank's pay grade, and similar to a detective's \"grade\", is also a discretionary promotion.\n\nThis pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units, i.e. [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|Detective Bureau]], Internal Affairs Bureau, Counter-Terrorism Bureau, and the [[New York City Police Department Intelligence Bureau|Intelligence Bureau]]. Lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment, pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts. \"Detective-specialists\" are a relatively new designation and one unique to the NYPD. In the 1980s, many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status, but were not being assigned to investigative duties. Examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor, police commissioner and other senior officials.\n\nTo remedy this situation, the rank of detective-specialist was created. These officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs, e.g., executive protection units, community affaires or NCO's, emergency service unit, sharpshooter, patrol instructor, helicopter instructor, etc. Like detective-investigators, detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status.\n\n[[File:NYPD police motorcycle.png|thumb|Motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby]]\n\nThe Department is administered and governed by the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner]], who is appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]]. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law.\n\nA Police Commissioner who comes up from the sworn ranks retains that status while serving as a police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm and retains the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioner's squad.\n\nThese individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department, and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, support services, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. Despite their role, as civilian administrators of the department, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the Commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations, however). Within the rank structure, there are also designations, known as \"grades\", that connote differences in duties, experience, and pay. However, supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above.\n\nBadges in the New York City Police Department are referred to as \"shields\" (the traditional term), though not all badge designs are strictly [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield-shaped]]. Every rank has a different badge design (with the exception of \"police officer\" and \"probationary police officer\"), and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge. Lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers, and tax registry number. Lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number. All sworn members of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a red background. Civilian employees of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a blue background, signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm. All ID cards have an expiration date.\n\n==Organization and structure==\n{{Main|Organization of the New York City Police Department}}\n[[File:NYPD One Police Plaza.JPG|thumb|[[1 Police Plaza]], NYPD HQ]]\n\n===Office of the Chief of Department===\nThe [[Chief of Police|Chief of Department]] serves as the senior sworn member of the NYPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/administration.shtml|title=NYPD Administration|work=nyc.gov}}</ref> [[Terence Monahan]] is the 40th individual to hold the post, which prior to 1987 was known as the chief of operations and before that as chief inspector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|title=NYPD - Administration|work=nyc.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920220513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|archivedate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Bureaus===\n{{convert to prose|date=January 2019}}\nThe Department is divided into twenty bureaus,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureaus|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/bureaus.page|website=New York Police Department|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> which are typically commanded by a uniformed bureau chief (such as the chief of patrol and the chief of housing) or a civilian deputy commissioner (such as the Deputy Commissioner of Information Technology).

All three of them participated in a school production of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett. They considered it as the start of Westlife. The six mentioned individuals formed a pop vocal group called '''Six as One''' in 1997. They changed their band name to '''IOYOU''' later. Before this, Egan was part of a [[punk-rock]] band called '''Skrod'''. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh and two other informal managers, released a single titled \"[[Together Girl Forever]]\" under Sound Records which was written by Feehily and Filan with fellow Irish [[Those Nervous Animals]] and The Strong are Lonely band members Padraig Meehan and Daragh Connolly. Another song \"Everlasting Love\" included in the single was written by Feehily, Keighron, Meehan, and Connolly. There is also an unreleased song called \"Good Thing\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1626452.stm|title=Westlife manager tells it straight|date=29 October 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> McDonagh first encountered Egan as a six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes, and came to know Filan and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Godspell]]'' for Sligo Fun Company.\n[[File:Louis Walsh2009July.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife is managed by [[Louis Walsh]].]][[File:Simon Cowell in December 2011.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife was originally signed by [[Simon Cowell]].]]\n[[Louis Walsh]], the manager of fellow Irish boy band [[Boyzone]], came to know the group after he was contacted by Filan's mother, Mae Filan, but the group failed to secure a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] record deal with Simon Cowell.

McFadden was part of an [[R&B]] group called '''Cartel''' before this.\n\nThe new group, formed on 3 July 1998, was renamed '''Westside''' but that name was already in use by another band, so it was changed to Westlife.

Westlife's first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and [[Backstreet Boys]]' concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer [[Ronan Keating]] was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. Later, they won a special Smash Hits Roadshow award at that year's ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]''. Their first live television performance as a group in Ireland and worldwide was on the Irish TV series and the world's second longest-running late-night talk show, ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' that had its broadcast on 13 November 1998.

They had only one hit single in the United States, \"Swear It Again\", which peaked at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 2000. The band made an appearance on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and the U.S. edition of their debut album, ''Westlife'' was released, but it didn't meet with success. In 2002, with the two most prominent boy bands in the US, the Backstreet Boys and [[*NSYNC]], going on hiatus that year, an attempt was made to promote and release a US version of \"World of Our Own\", but was never successful. ''Billboard'' called the failure due to corporate politics.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BQwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=billboard+westlife+corporate+politics#v=onepage&q=billboard%20westlife%20corporate%20politics&f=false |title=Reviews and Previews \u2013 Spotlight \u2013 Westlife \u2013 World of Our Own |magazine=Billboard|date=10 August 2002 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"We sent over a CD of ''World of Our Own'' with no name on it. They didn't know it was Westlife and every single radio station in the States \u2013 all came back and said that this is an absolutely huge hit. They said it was great for radio and people are gonna love it, especially as there's just a slight bit of rock guitar to it. But as soon as we revealed it was Westlife, the radio pluggers all went, 'Whoa, not Westlife \u2013 it's a boyband.' And we cannot break that down, no matter what song we come out with. The problem with America is that it's all radio and you've got to break into radio first. And currently radio doesn't want to play boy bands or pop music. If [[Bono]] wrote a song with us tomorrow and it was the biggest hit in the world, if Westlife's name is put to it, it won't be a hit in America because radio will not play us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/westlife-.blacklisted.-in-america |title=Westlife 'Blacklisted' In America|work=Contactmusic.com |date=8 July 2003 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>|Nicky Byrne, 8 July 2003 interview}}\n\n\"Flying Without Wings\" peaked at number-two in the US when ''American Idol: Season 2'' winner [[Ruben Studdard]] recorded and released it as his debut single. In 2003, Westlife went to [[Nashville]] to film a TV documentary. While they were there, they gave a live performance of the song \"[[Daytime Friends]]\", originally by country music singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Though Westlife didn't gain as much success in the States as they did elsewhere, their music was still appreciated. Kid David Corey, assistant PD and music director at top 40 WXKS (Kiss 108) radio station in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] was a Westlife supporter that was recorded saying \"Bands like Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync are still climbing the charts, and radio is supporting them, so I don't think the boy band thing is going to hurt them. Besides, this song [\"Swear it Again\"] is just too good for any of that to be a concern. I can't imagine anyone not playing this because it's another boy band, especially when it doesn't even sound like those other guys.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Chuck|title=Dublin's darling Westlife wins over Europe, aims for success in U.S.|journal=ProQuest|date=5 February 2000|volume=112|issue=6|page=110|id={{ProQuest|1011343}}}}</ref>\n\nCelebrities including [[Elton John]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Chris Martin]] of Coldplay, [[Jamie Vardy]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Martine McCutcheon]], [[Niall Horan]], [[BoybandPH#Neil Murillo|Neil Murillo]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[C.

They were originally signed by [[Simon Cowell]] in the UK, [[Clive Davis]] in the US and managed by [[Louis Walsh]] and Sonny Takhar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/irish-showbiz/westlife-reunion-croke-park-2019-13311082|title=Westlife set for major comeback at Croke Park in summer 2019|first=Connell|last=McHugh|date=26 September 2018|work=Irish Mirror}}</ref> The group currently consists of [[Shane Filan]], [[Markus Feehily|Mark Feehily]], [[Kian Egan]], and [[Nicky Byrne]], with [[Brian McFadden]] having left in 2004 to pursue a solo career. \n\nSo far, they have a total of thirteen major album releases, eleven of which are studio albums. Five albums are as a five-piece and eight are as a four-piece. The group rose to fame with their debut international self-titled studio album, ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999).

Before the start of their [[Turnaround Tour]] in 2004, one of the original members, [[Brian McFadden]], departed from the band. The four remaining members continued as a group to release their cover albums ''[[Allow Us to Be Frank]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Love Album (Westlife album)|The Love Album]]'' (2006) and the studio albums ''[[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]]'' (2005) and ''[[Back Home (Westlife album)|Back Home]]'' (2007).

All three of them participated in a school production of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett. They considered it as the start of Westlife. The six mentioned individuals formed a pop vocal group called '''Six as One''' in 1997. They changed their band name to '''IOYOU''' later. Before this, Egan was part of a [[punk-rock]] band called '''Skrod'''. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh and two other informal managers, released a single titled \"[[Together Girl Forever]]\" under Sound Records which was written by Feehily and Filan with fellow Irish [[Those Nervous Animals]] and The Strong are Lonely band members Padraig Meehan and Daragh Connolly. Another song \"Everlasting Love\" included in the single was written by Feehily, Keighron, Meehan, and Connolly. There is also an unreleased song called \"Good Thing\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1626452.stm|title=Westlife manager tells it straight|date=29 October 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> McDonagh first encountered Egan as a six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes, and came to know Filan and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Godspell]]'' for Sligo Fun Company.\n[[File:Louis Walsh2009July.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife is managed by [[Louis Walsh]].]][[File:Simon Cowell in December 2011.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Westlife was originally signed by [[Simon Cowell]].]]\n[[Louis Walsh]], the manager of fellow Irish boy band [[Boyzone]], came to know the group after he was contacted by Filan's mother, Mae Filan, but the group failed to secure a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] record deal with Simon Cowell. Cowell told Walsh: \"You are going to have to fire at least three of them. They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have ever seen in my life.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Cowell |first= Simon |title= I Don't Mean to Be Rude, But... |publisher= Broadway Books |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-7679-1741-3 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/idontmeantoberud00cowe }}</ref> Three members of the band (Lacey, Keighron, and Garrett) were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where [[Nicky Byrne]] and [[Brian McFadden]] were recruited. McFadden was part of an [[R&B]] group called '''Cartel''' before this.\n\nThe new group, formed on 3 July 1998, was renamed '''Westside''' but that name was already in use by another band, so it was changed to Westlife. It was revealed that Walsh was already calling them Westlife before Westside name came along.<ref name=\"Bower 2012\">{{cite book |last= Bower |first= Tom |title= Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-0345533951 }}</ref> In ''[[Westlife \u2013 Our Story]]'', Byrne revealed that, unlike the others in the group, he was keen to change the name to West High. McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan to make it easier to sign autographs. They managed to secure a major record deal the second time around under BMG with all other record labels competed. They have signed a four million pound record deal with [[RCA Records]]. Westlife's first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and [[Backstreet Boys]]' concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer [[Ronan Keating]] was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. Later, they won a special Smash Hits Roadshow award at that year's ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]''. Their first live television performance as a group in Ireland and worldwide was on the Irish TV series and the world's second longest-running late-night talk show, ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' that had its broadcast on 13 November 1998. They performed \"[[Flying Without Wings]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/2018/1108/1009544-when-westlife-were-westside/ |title=Welcome Westside 1998 |publisher=RTE}}</ref> The band then released an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Swear It Again]]'' afterwards. Both recorded songs under Westside were produced by [[Steve Mac]] and written by Mac and [[Wayne Hector]]. The debut extended play and single was chosen by Cowell with the guidance of his father, [[Eric Cowell]].

The problem with America is that it's all radio and you've got to break into radio first. And currently radio doesn't want to play boy bands or pop music.

Though Westlife didn't gain as much success in the States as they did elsewhere, their music was still appreciated.
