In 1968 Westlake became exclusively a secondary school.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Merger ===\nAs both schools continued to grow in size towards the late 1980s, and as gender exclusivity became less of a factor both in the schools' reputations and desirability, the trustees of both Harvard and Westlake effectuated a merger in 1989.

He was awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] in 1927 on the strength of the research he had done on [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and went to England, where he studied under Sir [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. There, he used a [[particle accelerator]] to fire [[heavy hydrogen]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] ([[deuteron]]s) at various targets. He discovered the respective nuclei of [[helium-3]] (helions) and of [[tritium]] (tritons). He also discovered that when they [[neutron\u2013proton ratio|reacted with each other]], the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.\n\nOliphant left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 to become the [[John Henry Poynting|Poynting]] Professor of Physics at the [[University of Birmingham]]. He attempted to build a {{convert|60|inch|cm|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] at the university, but its completion was postponed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939. He became involved with the development of [[radar]], heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]]. They created a radical new design, the [[cavity magnetron]], that made [[microwave radar]] possible. Oliphant also formed part of the [[MAUD Committee]], which reported in July 1941, that an [[atomic bomb]] was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the [[Manhattan Project]]. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend [[Ernest Lawrence]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California]], developing [[electromagnetic isotope separation]], which provided the [[fissile]] component of the [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb used in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] in August 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Oliphant returned to Australia as the first director of the [[Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering]] at the new [[Australian National University]] (ANU), where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) [[homopolar generator]]. He retired in 1967, but was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]] on the advice of [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[Don Dunstan]]. He assisted in the founding of the [[Australian Democrats]] political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he witnessed his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary [[euthanasia]]. He died in Canberra in 2000.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarcus \"Mark\" Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in [[Kent Town, South Australia|Kent Town]], a suburb of Adelaide.

In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his [[cloud chamber]] that confirmed the existence of the [[positron]] and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron\u2013electron [[pair production]].{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nOliphant followed up the work by constructing a [[particle accelerator]] that could fire protons with up to 600,000 [[electronvolts]] of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockcroft and Walton on the [[artificial disintegration]] of the nucleus and positive [[ion]]s. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=48\u201350}} In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American [[physical chemist]] [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] of a few drops of [[heavy water]]. The accelerator was used to fire [[heavy hydrogen]] nuclei (''[[deuteron]]s'', which Rutherford called ''diplons'') at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of [[helium-3]] (''helions'') and [[tritium]] (''tritons'').{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=52\u201355}}<ref>{{cite journal |first=M.

While visiting prototype radar stations, he realised that shorter-wavelength [[radio waves]] were needed urgently, especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set small enough to fit into an aircraft. In August 1939, he took a small group to [[Ventnor]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], to examine the [[Chain Home]] system first hand. He obtained a grant from the [[Admiralty]] to develop radar systems with wavelengths less than {{convert|10|cm|0}}; the best available at the time was {{convert|150|cm|-1}}.<ref name=\"odnb\" />\n\nOliphant's group at Birmingham worked on developing two promising devices, the [[klystron]] and the [[magnetron]]. Working with [[James Sayers (physicist)|James Sayers]], Oliphant managed to produce an improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]], worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of {{convert|9.8|cm}}, just the kind of [[microwaves|short wavelengths]] needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German [[U-boats]], intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=83\u201390}}\n\nIn 1940, the [[Fall of France]], and the possibility that Britain might be invaded, prompted Oliphant to send his wife and children to Australia. The [[Fall of Singapore]] in February 1942 led him to offer his services to [[John Madsen (physicist)|John Madsen]], the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the [[University of Sydney]], and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]], which was responsible for developing radar.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=83\u201390}}{{sfn|Mellor|1958|pp=427\u2013428}} He embarked from Glasgow for Australia on {{ship|QSMV|Dominion Monarch}} on 20 March.

Oliphant persuaded Professor [[Thomas Laby]] to release [[Eric Burhop]] and [[Leslie H. Martin|Leslie Martin]] from their work on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the [[University of Melbourne]] in May 1942.{{sfn|Mellor|1958|p=446}} Oliphant worked with Martin on the process of moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=92\u201393}} Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.{{sfn|Mellor|1958|p=450}}\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nAt the University of Birmingham in March 1940, [[Otto Frisch]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]] examined the theoretical issues involved in developing, producing and using [[atomic bomb]]s in a paper that became known as the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]]. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a [[chain reaction]] occur, but it might require as little as {{convert|1|kg|0}} of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of [[TNT]]. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir [[Henry Tizard]], the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW).{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39\u201341, 407}} As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the [[MAUD Committee]] was created to investigate the matter further.

Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell, but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain's commitments to the United States.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nOliphant envisaged Canberra one day becoming a [[college town|university town]] like Oxford or Cambridge.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=52\u201353}} A threat to the future of the University arose in the wake of the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], when the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] led by [[Robert Menzies]] won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the [[Menzies government]] amalgamated it with the [[Canberra University College]]. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission,{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=171\u2013179}} and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/strategic-plans/anu-2020-strategy.pdf |title=ANU by 2020 |publisher=Australian National University |accessdate=30 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204195830/http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/strategic-plans/anu-2020-strategy.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to becoming a reality.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Canberra Times]] |date=1 December 2014 |first=Emma |last=Macdonald |title=Canberra the most 'university town' in the country, say UC and ANU |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-the-most-university-town-in-the-country-say-uc-and-anu-20141201-11xh7s.html |accessdate=27 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610005222/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-the-most-university-town-in-the-country-say-uc-and-anu-20141201-11xh7s.html |archive-date=10 June 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1951, Oliphant applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the [[Red Scare]]. The American [[McCarran Act]] restricted travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was [[1951 Australian referendum|attempting to ban the Communist Party]], and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the [[United States Department of State]]. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga]], nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=188\u2013193}}\n\nIn 1955, Oliphant initiated the design and construction of a 500 megajoule [[homopolar generator]] (HPG), the world's largest. This massive machine contained three discs {{convert|3.5|m}} in diameter and weighing {{convert|38|tonnes|LT}}. He obtained \u00a340,000 ({{Inflation|AU|80000|1955|fmt=eq|cursign=A$|r=-6}}) initial funding from the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]].{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=229\u2013231}} Completed in 1963, the HPG was intended to be the power source for a synchrotron, but this was not built.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=247\u2013249}} Instead, it was used to power the LT-4 [[Tokamak]] and a large-scale [[railgun]] that was used as a scientific instrument for experiments with [[plasma physics]]. It was decommissioned in 1985.<ref name=\"AAS\" />\n\n[[File:Australian Academy of Science - The Shine Dome.jpg|thumb|right|Australian Academy of Science&nbsp;\u2013 The Shine Dome in Canberra]]\nOliphant founded the [[Australian Academy of Science]] in 1954, teaming up with [[David Martyn]] to overcome the obstacles that had frustrated previous attempts. Oliphant was its president until 1956. Deciding that the Academy of Science should have its own special building, Oliphant raised the required money from donations. As chairman of the Building Design Committee, he selected and oversaw the construction of one of Canberra's most striking architectural designs. He also delivered the Academy of Science's 1961 [[Matthew Flinders]] Lecture, on the subject of \"[[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] in his time and today\".<ref name=\"AAS\" />\n\nOliphant retired as Professor of Particle Physics in 1964, and was appointed Professor of Ionised Gases. In this chair he produced his first research papers since the 1930s. He was appointed [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1967.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=247\u2013249}} He was invited by the [[Premier of South Australia|premier]], [[Don Dunstan]], to become the [[Governor of South Australia]], a position he held from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he caused great concern to Dunstan when he strongly supported the decision of the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]].<ref name=\"FRS\" />\n\n''[[The Age]]'' reported in 1981 that \"Sir Mark Oliphant warned the Dunstan Government of the 'grave dangers' of appointing an [[Australian Aborigine]], Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]], to succeed him as South Australia's Governor\".<ref name=\"Black\" /> Oliphant had secretly written, \"[t]here is something inherent in the personality of the Aborigine which makes it difficult for him to adapt fully to the ways of the white man.\" The authors of Oliphant's biography noted that \"that was the prevailing attitude of

{{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100|sep=,|AC|KBE|FRS|FAA|FTSE}} (8 October 1901 \u2013 14 July 2000) was an Australian [[physicist]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] who played an important role in the first experimental demonstration of [[nuclear fusion]] and in the [[History of nuclear weapons|development of nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], Oliphant graduated from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1922. He was awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] in 1927 on the strength of the research he had done on [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and went to England, where he studied under Sir [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. There, he used a [[particle accelerator]] to fire [[heavy hydrogen]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] ([[deuteron]]s) at various targets. He discovered the respective nuclei of [[helium-3]] (helions) and of [[tritium]] (tritons). He also discovered that when they [[neutron\u2013proton ratio|reacted with each other]], the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.\n\nOliphant left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 to become the [[John Henry Poynting|Poynting]] Professor of Physics at the [[University of Birmingham]]. He attempted to build a {{convert|60|inch|cm|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] at the university, but its completion was postponed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939. He became involved with the development of [[radar]], heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]]. They created a radical new design, the [[cavity magnetron]], that made [[microwave radar]] possible. Oliphant also formed part of the [[MAUD Committee]], which reported in July 1941, that an [[atomic bomb]] was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the [[Manhattan Project]]. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend [[Ernest Lawrence]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California]], developing [[electromagnetic isotope separation]], which provided the [[fissile]] component of the [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb used in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] in August 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Oliphant returned to Australia as the first director of the [[Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering]] at the new [[Australian National University]] (ANU), where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) [[homopolar generator]]. He retired in 1967, but was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]] on the advice of [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[Don Dunstan]]. He assisted in the founding of the [[Australian Democrats]] political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he witnessed his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary [[euthanasia]]. He died in Canberra in 2000.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarcus \"Mark\" Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in [[Kent Town, South Australia|Kent Town]], a suburb of Adelaide.

There were two fellow Australians: [[Harrie Massey]] and [[John Keith Roberts]]. Oliphant would become especially close friends with Cockcroft. The laboratory had considerable talent but little money to spare, and tended to use a \"string and sealing wax\" approach to experimental equipment.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|p=37}} Oliphant had to buy his own equipment, at one point spending \u00a324 ({{Inflation|AU|24|1927|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=AUD$}}) of his allowance on a [[vacuum pump]].{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|p=41}}\n\nOliphant submitted his [[PhD]] thesis on ''The Neutralization of Positive Ions at Metal Surfaces, and the Emission of Secondary Electrons'' in December 1929.<ref name=\"AAS\" /> For his ''[[oral exam|viva]]'', he was examined by Rutherford and Ellis.

Cockcroft and Walton bombarded [[lithium]] with high energy [[proton]]s and succeeded in [[nuclear transmutation|transmuting]] it into energetic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[helium]]. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the [[atomic nucleus]] of one element to another by artificial means. Chadwick then devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the [[neutron]]. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his [[cloud chamber]] that confirmed the existence of the [[positron]] and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron\u2013electron [[pair production]].{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nOliphant followed up the work by constructing a [[particle accelerator]] that could fire protons with up to 600,000 [[electronvolts]] of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockcroft and Walton on the [[artificial disintegration]] of the nucleus and positive [[ion]]s. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=48\u201350}} In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American [[physical chemist]] [[Gilbert N.

While visiting prototype radar stations, he realised that shorter-wavelength [[radio waves]] were needed urgently, especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set small enough to fit into an aircraft. In August 1939, he took a small group to [[Ventnor]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], to examine the [[Chain Home]] system first hand.

Working with [[James Sayers (physicist)|James Sayers]], Oliphant managed to produce an improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]], worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of {{convert|9.8|cm}}, just the kind of [[microwaves|short wavelengths]] needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German [[U-boats]], intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=83\u201390}}\n\nIn 1940, the [[Fall of France]], and the possibility that Britain might be invaded, prompted Oliphant to send his wife and children to Australia.

They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a [[chain reaction]] occur, but it might require as little as {{convert|1|kg|0}} of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of [[TNT]]. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir [[Henry Tizard]], the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW).{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39\u201341, 407}} As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the [[MAUD Committee]] was created to investigate the matter further.

But Oliphant accepted, and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the [[Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering]] at the [[Australian National University]]. Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics, which he headed himself, a Department of Nuclear Physics under [[Ernest Titterton]], a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger, a Department of Astronomy under [[Bart Bok]], a Department of Theoretical Physics under [[Kenneth Le Couteur]] and a Department of Mathematics under [[Bernhard Neumann]].{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=171\u2013179}}\n\n[[File:Baxter Oliphant (1954).jpg|thumb|left|During a two-day symposium on \"Atomic Power in Australia\" at the New South Wales University of Technology, Sydney, which began on 31 August 1954, Oliphant (left), [[Homi Jehangir Bhabha]] (centre) and [[Philip Baxter]] (right) meet over a cup of tea]]\nOliphant was an advocate of nuclear weapons research. He served on the post-war Technical Committee that advised the British government on nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=45}} and publicly declared that Britain needed to develop its own nuclear weapons independent of the United States to \"avoid the danger of becoming a lesser power\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|p=53}} The establishment of a world-class nuclear physics research capability in Australia was intimately linked with the government's plans to develop nuclear power and weapons. Locating the new research institute in [[Canberra]] would place it close to the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]], which was planned to be the centrepiece of a new nuclear power industry.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=147}} Oliphant hoped that Britain would assist with the Australian program, and the British were interested in cooperation because Australia had uranium ore and weapons testing sites, and there were concerns that Australia was becoming too closely aligned with the United States. Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell, but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain's commitments to the United States.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nOliphant envisaged Canberra one day becoming a [[college town|university town]] like Oxford or Cambridge.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=52\u201353}} A threat to the future of the University arose in the wake of the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 election]], when the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] led by [[Robert Menzies]] won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the [[Menzies government]] amalgamated it with the [[Canberra University College]]. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission,{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=171\u2013179}} and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/strategic-plans/anu-2020-strategy.pdf |title=ANU by 2020 |publisher=Australian National University |accessdate=30 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204195830/http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/strategic-plans/anu-2020-strategy.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to becoming a reality.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Canberra Times]] |date=1 December 2014 |first=Emma |last=Macdonald |title=Canberra the most 'university town' in the country, say UC and ANU |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-the-most-university-town-in-the-country-say-uc-and-anu-20141201-11xh7s.html |accessdate=27 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610005222/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-the-most-university-town-in-the-country-say-uc-and-anu-20141201-11xh7s.html |archive-date=10 June 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1951, Oliphant applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the [[Red Scare]]. The American [[McCarran Act]] restricted travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was [[1951 Australian referendum|attempting to ban the Communist Party]], and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the [[United States Department of State]]. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga]], nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=188\u2013193}}\n\nIn 1955, Oliphant initiated the design and construction of a 500 megajoule [[homopolar generator]] (HPG), the world's largest.

{"title_page": "Ipswich Whitefriars", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n'''Ipswich Whitefriars''' was the medieval religious house of [[Carmelite|Carmelite friars]] (under a [[prior]]) which formerly stood near the centre of the town of [[Ipswich]], the county town of [[Suffolk]], UK.<ref>W.

[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37922 at British History Online]</ref> It was the last of the three principal friaries to be founded in Ipswich, the first being the [[Ipswich Greyfriars]] ([[Franciscans]]), under [[Baron Tibetot|Tibetot family]] patronage before 1236, and the second the [[Ipswich Blackfriars]] ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]) founded by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1263. The house of the Carmelite Order of [[White Friars]] was established in c. 1278-79. In its heyday it was the home of many eminent scholars, supplied several [[Provincial superior]]s of the Order in England, and was repeatedly host to the provincial chapters of the Order.\n\nAll three friaries were dissolved or suppressed in 1538, the Greyfriars in April and the other two in November. The Whitefriars stood south of the Ipswich Buttermarket street and mainly to the west of St Stephen's Lane, but nothing now remains visible above ground. The site was partly exposed by diggings in c. 1898, observed by [[Nina Frances Layard|Nina Layard]],<ref>[[Nina Frances Layard|N. F.

However, the first members of the new community were probably chosen from among those of Norwich.<ref>Zimmerman 1899, 196.</ref>\n\nThe site chosen was in the centre of the town, in an area south of the Buttermarket street and north of Old Foundry Road, at first to the east of St Stephen's Lane and afterwards over much of the area from St Stephen's Lane westward toward Queen Street.<ref>Layard 1899: Redstone 1899, 190-192.</ref> This block corresponds roughly to the area occupied by the modern Ipswich Buttermarket shopping centre, erected c.1990.<ref>K.

An early Prior, Richard de Yllea (i.e. [[Monks Eleigh]]), had joined the Order after the death of his wife, and had received his own son Thomas into the Order.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1899, 197-198\">Zimmerman 1899, 197-198.</ref> (Thomas became a very devout follower of the rule, took degrees at Cambridge, and wrote books on philosophy, theology and the Apocalypse.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1899, 199\">Zimmerman 1899, 199.</ref>) Following the death of a provincial superior, a chapter was held at Ipswich in 1300, at which the then Ipswich Prior, William Ludlyngton (a native of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], who had studied at [[Oxford]]), was elected the new Provincial. Three years later, at a General chapter at [[Narbonne]], the General superior Gerard of Boulogne announced his intention to split the English province by creating a separate Irish province. Ludlyngton, Thomas de Yllea and many others opposed him, but after a Papal intervention and a great chapter at London in 1305, Ludlyngton was forced to resign and was sent to Paris \"to fast and to read Divinity\", and Thomas de Yllea similarly was sent to Bruges as a lecturer.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1899, 197-198\"/>\n\n* John Barkhamstead, a former Prior of Ipswich, was elected Provincial in 1312.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 1899, 198\">Zimmerman 1899, 198.</ref>\n* John Polested, a friar of Ipswich from his youth who afterwards studied at Oxford, became Vicar-General under the General Petrus de Casa (1330-1339) and Provincial from 1335 until his death in 1341: the author of more than twenty scholarly works, he was buried at [[York]].<ref>Zimmerman 1899, 200: Redstone 1899, 193.</ref>\n* John Kynyngham, another member of the Ipswich community, was elected Provincial of England and Ireland in a chapter at [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]] in 1393, and held it until his death in 1399. He was the confessor of [[John of Gaunt]] (and a witness to his will), and at Oxford frequently disputed with [[John Wycliffe]]. He wrote a disputative book against Wycliffe,<ref>I.C. Levy, 'Defining the responsibility of the late medieval theologian: the debate between John Kynyngham and John Wyclif', ''Carmelus'' XLIX (2002), 5-29.</ref> and commentaries, treatises, sermons and 13 books on metaphysics.<ref>Zimmerman 1899, 202; Redstone 1899, 194.</ref>\n*Friar Nicholas Kenton received his early education at Ipswich Whitefriars, before studying at Cambridge.

The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].
