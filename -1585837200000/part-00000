In his paper on the subject<ref>{{cite journal | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The Cultivation of Liberian Coffee | journal = Timehri : Being the Journal of the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana | volume = 3 | pages = 286\u2013307 | publisher = J Thomson | location = Demerara | date = 1884}}</ref> he began by noting that \"Liberian coffee was introduced into the West Indies from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Gardens at Kew]] in the year 1874, when a few plants were sent by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Sir Joseph Hooker]] to the Botanic Gardens at [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]], and to the late Dr Imray of Dominica.\" He goes on to describe the preferred soils and the need for shelter trees to protect from hurricanes.\n\nIn the early 1880s - during Hooker's last few years as Director of Kew - Nicholls was the Kew correspondent for Dominica. For that reason Nicholls dedicated his ''Text-Book on Tropical Agriculture'' to Sir Joseph.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = A Text-Book of Tropical Agriculture | pages = | publisher = Macmillan and Co. Ltd. | location = London | date = 1892}}</ref> The demand for it was such that the book was reprinted seven times at intervals of about five years; it was also translated into several languages along with [[Swiss]]-[[Venezuelan]] [[geographer]] and [[botanist]] [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier]]. Nicholls wrote many letters to Hooker, [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|Sir William Thiselton-Dyer]], [[Daniel Morris (botanist)|Daniel Morris]] and others at Kew.<ref>{{cite web | title = Archive Catalogue | website = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://www.calmview.eu/kew/calmview/Overview.aspx | access-date = 18 February 2020}}</ref> He also contributed plants and seeds to the collection there.<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first =  | title = A List of the Collectors Whose Plants Are in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to 31st December, 1899 | journal = Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information | volume = 1901 | page = 49 | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | location = Kew | date = 1901}}</ref>\n\nSoon after his election as a Corresponding Member of the [[Zoological Society of London]] (CMZS), Nicholls donated two common [[Boidae|boas]] and seven slender-fingered [[frogs]] to the zoo.<ref name = \"ZSL\">Broadhurst, Sarah, Archivist and Records Manager, Zoological Society of London, February 2020</ref>\n\nNicholls' passion for expanding the export of fruit was expressed in his booklet on ''The cultivation of the banana in Dominica''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The cultivation of the banana in Dominica | pages = | publisher = A.T. Righton, Printer to the Govt. | location = | date = 1890}}</ref> He noted that now that [[Dominica]] had become the last port of call by the Quebec Steamship Company on its West Indies to New York line \"there is no reason why the planters of the island should not participate in the profits from the banana trade\", which currently was dominated by Jamaica. With his usual clarity and precision he went on to describe the conditions necessary for successful  propagation of the fruit.\n\nIn 1887, [[James Anthony Froude]] travelled to the West Indies. During his visit to [[Dominica]] he was invited by Nicholls to visit his home, where he saw the very successful cultivation of lime trees:\n{{Quote |text= I do not know the exact extent of the property which was under cultivation; perhaps it was twenty-five or thirty acres. The chief part of it was planted with lime trees, the limes which I saw growing being as large as moderate-sized lemons; most of the rest was covered with Liberian coffee, which does not object to the moist climate, and was growing with profuse luxuriance. Each tree, each plant had been personally attended to, pruned when it needed pruning, supported by bamboos if it was overgrowing its strength, while the ground about the house was consecrated to botanical experiments, and specimens were to be seen there of every tropical flower, shrub, or tree, which was either remarkable for its beauty or valuable for its chemical properties. His limes and coffee went principally to New York, where they had won a reputation, and were in special demand; but ingenuity tries other tracks besides the beaten one. Dr. Nicholls had a manufactory of [[Citric acid|citric acid]] which had been found equally excellent in Europe. Everything which he produced was turning to gold, except donkeys, seven or eight of which were feeding under his windows, and which multiplied so fast that he could not tell what to do with them. |author=James Anthony Froude |title= |source= ''The English in the West Indies'' (1888)<ref>{{cite book | last = Froude | first = James Anthony | title = The English in the West Indies: Or, The Bow of Ulysses | pages = | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co | location = London | date = 1888}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1889 [[The Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana]] sought and received advice on the packing of fruit for export. Nicholls gave precise instructions on when and how to cut [[oranges]] and [[limes]], wrap them in a special paper, and pack them in specific designs of crate or barrel.

There, with the help of their carriers (four men and some boys) they climbed up through heavily forested slopes and found [[Boiling Lake]] \u2013 \u201ca large sheet of water in a constant state of ebullition.\u201d On a second trip, in April, the lake's altitude was found to be 2425 feet (739 metres), and its size about 150 by 80 yards, much smaller than estimated on the first trip.<ref>Nicholls gives two different dates for the discovery: \"January 1875\" in {{Cite news | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = The Boiling Lake of Dominica | pages = 562\u20133 | newspaper = The Field | location = London | date = 5 June 1875}}, and \"March 2nd 1875\" in {{Cite news | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = Boiling Lake at Dominica | pages = | newspaper = The Graphic | location = | date = 9 April 1879}}</ref>\n\nNicholls wrote an article about a volcanic explosion which took place about a mile southwest of [[Boiling Lake]] on 4 January 1880.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls  | first1 = H A Alford |  title = The Volcanic Eruption in Dominica | journal = Nature | volume = 21 | issue = 538 | pages = 372\u20133 | location = London| date = 19 February 1880| doi = 10.1038/021372c0 | bibcode = 1880Natur..21..372N }}</ref> In 1883 he wrote a letter giving a vivid description of the impact of a hurricane on 4 September, with 5 churches destroyed and over 400 families homeless in Roseau.<ref>{{Citation | title = General Foreign News | page = 5 | newspaper = London Evening Standard | location = | date = 29 September 1883}}</ref> In 1902 he gave a detailed account of events associated with the massive eruption of [[Mount Pel\u00e9e]] in Martinique.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls| first1 = H A Alford | title = Notes on the Recent Eruptions of Mont Pel\u00e9e | journal = Nature | volume = 66 | issue = 1721 | page = 638 | date = 1902| doi = 10.1038/066638b0 | bibcode = 1902Natur..66..638N }}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1880, Nicholls escorted 14 year-old George Prince of Wales (the future King [[George V]]), and his elder brother [[Prince Albert Victor]], first on ponies and then on foot to the \u201chighest point in the island, [[Morne Diablotins|Morne Diablotin]], 5,314 feet high, nearly a thousand feet higher than the highest point in Great Britain, [[Ben Nevis]].\u201d<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Prince of Wales | first1 = George | last2 = Albert Victor | first2 = Prince | last3 = Alton | first3 = John N D | title = The Cruise of [[HMS Bacchante (1876)|H.M.S. \"Bacchante\"]], 1879\u20141882| volume = I | location = London | publisher = Macmillan & Co | page = 133 | date = 1880}}</ref>\n\nNicholls was a frequent publicist for Dominica.

In his paper on the subject<ref>{{cite journal | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The Cultivation of Liberian Coffee | journal = Timehri : Being the Journal of the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana | volume = 3 | pages = 286\u2013307 | publisher = J Thomson | location = Demerara | date = 1884}}</ref> he began by noting that \"Liberian coffee was introduced into the West Indies from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Gardens at Kew]] in the year 1874, when a few plants were sent by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Sir Joseph Hooker]] to the Botanic Gardens at [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]], and to the late Dr Imray of Dominica.\" He goes on to describe the preferred soils and the need for shelter trees to protect from hurricanes.\n\nIn the early 1880s - during Hooker's last few years as Director of Kew - Nicholls was the Kew correspondent for Dominica. For that reason Nicholls dedicated his ''Text-Book on Tropical Agriculture'' to Sir Joseph.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = A Text-Book of Tropical Agriculture | pages = | publisher = Macmillan and Co. Ltd. | location = London | date = 1892}}</ref> The demand for it was such that the book was reprinted seven times at intervals of about five years; it was also translated into several languages along with [[Swiss]]-[[Venezuelan]] [[geographer]] and [[botanist]] [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier]]. Nicholls wrote many letters to Hooker, [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|Sir William Thiselton-Dyer]], [[Daniel Morris (botanist)|Daniel Morris]] and others at Kew.<ref>{{cite web | title = Archive Catalogue | website = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://www.calmview.eu/kew/calmview/Overview.aspx | access-date = 18 February 2020}}</ref> He also contributed plants and seeds to the collection there.<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first =  | title = A List of the Collectors Whose Plants Are in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to 31st December, 1899 | journal = Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information | volume = 1901 | page = 49 | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | location = Kew | date = 1901}}</ref>\n\nSoon after his election as a Corresponding Member of the [[Zoological Society of London]] (CMZS), Nicholls donated two common [[Boidae|boas]] and seven slender-fingered [[frogs]] to the zoo.<ref name = \"ZSL\">Broadhurst, Sarah, Archivist and Records Manager, Zoological Society of London, February 2020</ref>\n\nNicholls' passion for expanding the export of fruit was expressed in his booklet on ''The cultivation of the banana in Dominica''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The cultivation of the banana in Dominica | pages = | publisher = A.T. Righton, Printer to the Govt. | location = | date = 1890}}</ref> He noted that now that Dominica had become the last port of call by the Quebec Steamship Company on its West Indies to New York line \"there is no reason why the planters of the island should not participate in the profits from the banana trade\", which currently was dominated by Jamaica. With his usual clarity and precision he went on to describe the conditions necessary for successful  propagation of the fruit.\n\nIn 1887, [[James Anthony Froude]] travelled to the West Indies. During his visit to Dominica he was invited by Nicholls to visit his home, where he saw the very successful cultivation of lime trees:\n{{Quote |text= I do not know the exact extent of the property which was under cultivation; perhaps it was twenty-five or thirty acres. The chief part of it was planted with lime trees, the limes which I saw growing being as large as moderate-sized lemons; most of the rest was covered with Liberian coffee, which does not object to the moist climate, and was growing with profuse luxuriance. Each tree, each plant had been personally attended to, pruned when it needed pruning, supported by bamboos if it was overgrowing its strength, while the ground about the house was consecrated to botanical experiments, and specimens were to be seen there of every tropical flower, shrub, or tree, which was either remarkable for its beauty or valuable for its chemical properties. His limes and coffee went principally to New York, where they had won a reputation, and were in special demand; but ingenuity tries other tracks besides the beaten one. Dr. Nicholls had a manufactory of [[Citric acid|citric acid]] which had been found equally excellent in Europe. Everything which he produced was turning to gold, except donkeys, seven or eight of which were feeding under his windows, and which multiplied so fast that he could not tell what to do with them. |author=James Anthony Froude |title= |source= ''The English in the West Indies'' (1888)<ref>{{cite book | last = Froude | first = James Anthony | title = The English in the West Indies: Or, The Bow of Ulysses | pages = | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co | location = London | date = 1888}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1889 [[The Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana]] sought and received advice on the packing of fruit for export. Nicholls gave precise instructions on when and how to cut oranges and limes, wrap them in a special paper, and pack them in specific designs of crate or barrel.
