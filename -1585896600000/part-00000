He had difficulty in getting commissions and taught at the [[Gordon Institute of TAFE|Gordon Technical College]] in [[Geelong, Victoria]], and in July 1924 exhibited at the [[Geelong Art Gallery]]. When [[Charles Web Gilbert]] died in 1925, Montford was asked to complete the design for the memorial at [[Port Said]]; but there were difficulties in carrying out the work in Australia, and eventually it was given to [[Edgar Bertram Mackennal|Sir Bertram Mackennal]] in London. The winning of the competition for the sculpture for the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] at [[Melbourne]] gave Montford many years of work. He designed and modeled the four groups each 23 feet (7&nbsp;m) high, and the two tympani each 56 feet (17&nbsp;m) long and 8 feet (2.4&nbsp;m) high in the centre. \n[[Image:Wesleystatue.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The statue of [[John Wesley]]<br>by Paul R. Montford]]\nMontford was president of the [[Victorian Artists Society]] from 1930 to 1932. His generally good work as president was occasionally marred by a certain lack of tact. Some of Montford's best work about this period included the bronzes, \"Water Nymph\" and \"Peter Pan\", now in the [[Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne]], and \"The Court Favourite\" in the [[Flagstaff Gardens, Melbourne]]. Other work includes relief portraits of eight Australian statesmen in the King's Hall, [[Parliament House, Canberra]], and the war memorial for the Australian Club, Sydney. He was greatly encouraged and pleased on learning in 1934, that his statue of [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]] at Melbourne had been awarded the gold medal of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] for the best piece of sculpture of the year. Another excellent piece of work is his vigorous statue of [[John Wesley]] in front of [[Wesley Church, Melbourne]]. His ''[[George Higinbotham]]'' near the [[Old Treasury Building, Melbourne|treasury]] is less successful. Other examples of Montford's work are the memorials to [[Carlo Catani]] (St Kilda), [[William Chaffey|William Benjamin Chaffey]] (Mildura), [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Sir Ross Macpherson Smith]] (Adelaide), and 'Pioneer Women' (Sydney). Montford is represented in the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne by \"Atalanta\", the \"Spirit of Anzac\", and two busts, and he is also represented in the Art Gallery of South Australia in [[Adelaide]]. He provided a model from which a portrait bust of Socrates was carved for the University of [[Western Australia]] by Victor Wager in 1932.\n\n==Legacy==\nMontford died after a short illness of [[leukemia]] on 15 January 1938 in [[Richmond, Victoria]]; he was survived by his wife and two daughters and a son. His ashes were scattered in the woods at Leatherhead, Surrey, England.\n\nMontford refused to be influenced by the modernist school and was convinced it was a passing phase in art. The Greeks and the great Italians of the [[Renaissance Classicism|Renaissance]] appealed to him most. He was a sculptor of ability whose work showed good modelling, grace, careful arrangement, and vigour, as the occasion demanded.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Paul Raphael Montford}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Montford, Paul Raphael}}\n[[Category:1868 births]]\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:English sculptors]]\n[[Category:English male sculptors]]\n[[Category:Deaths from leukemia]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:People from Kentish Town]]\n[[Category:20th-century British sculptors]]\n[[Category:19th-century British sculptors]]\n[[Category:Paul Raphael Montford|*]]\n", "text_old": "__NOTOC__\n[[File:Music, figure on Kelvingrove Bridge by Paul Montford.jpg|thumb|Music, figure on Kelvingrove Bridge by Paul Montford]]\n[[File:One of Paul Montford's figures on Kelvin Bridge in Glasgow.jpg|thumb|One of Paul Montford's figures on Kelvin Bridge in Glasgow]]\n'''Paul Raphael Montford''' (1 November 1868 \u2013 15 January 1938) was an [[England|English]]-born sculptor, also active in [[Australia]]; winner of the gold medal of the [[Royal Society of British Sculptors]] in 1934.<ref name=adb>Jenny Zimmer, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100542b.htm Montford, Paul Raphael (1868 - 1938)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 10, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1986, p. 557.

Ian Rotten, however, still recognized Mickie as the IWA Mid-South Women's Champion, leading to the titles splitting into two separate entities.\n\nAs such, Knuckles became the IWA Mid-South Women's Champion, keeping the title for five months before losing it to her first ever opponent Hailey Hatred, on the 18th November 2005. Knuckles would win the title back at an IWA East Coast event in February 2006, and held on to it until July 2007 before losing it to Chuck Taylor in controversial fashion, since Chuck is in fact a man.  Mickie earned an IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship match against Chuck, but was met with disapproval from Chuck who stated that if he had to put up his title against a female, than the female should also put her title on the line as well. Mickie agreed and was defeated by Chuck who then became the men's and women's champion. Less than a month later, Mickie won back her title by defeating Taylor in a Falls Count Anywhere match to regain the Women's Championship for a third time. She would go on to hold the title until May 2, 2008, where she lost to by Daizee Haze in a triple threat match also involving Sara Del Rey.\n\nBefore receiving a rematch for the IWA Women's Championship, Knuckles broke her right femur on July 6, 2008 after performing a diving crossbody off a platform onto Del Rey.<ref>https://www.wrestlingnewssource.com/news/7092/Mickie-Knuckles-Injury-Update-After-Surgery/</ref>\n\n====King of the Death Match Tournament====\nAfter losing on the first night in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Fans Bring the Weapons match|Fans Bring the Weapons Match]] in the 2006 tournament, Knuckles once again was booked in the King of the Death Match Tournament in 2007, becoming the only woman to ever be booked for the show on multiple occasions.\n\nOn Night One, Knuckles defeated Tank in a Barbed Wire Ropes and Barbed Wire Baseball Bat Deathmatch.

This put Mickie through to the final where she defeated [[Mayumi Ozaki]] in a No Rope Barbed Wire, Fans Bring The Weapons Steel Cage Death Match to become the first ever IWA Mid-South Queen of the Death Match.

[[Tuninter Flight 1153]], a [[Tuninter]] [[ATR-72]] en route from Bari to [[Djerba]], [[Tunisia]], ditched into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] about 18 miles from the city of [[Palermo]]. 16 of the 39 people on board died. The accident resulted from engine [[fuel starvation]] that resulted from the installation of the wrong fuel quantity indicator. The fuel quantity indicator installed had been calibrated for the smaller [[ATR-42]] aircraft and showed significantly more fuel than was actually in the tank of the larger ATR 72. When the aircraft ran out of fuel, the indicator still showed 1800 kilograms of fuel remaining thus confusing the crew for several minutes. Both engines stopped and the crew was forced to ditch the airliner in the sea.<ref name=\"ASN\">{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050806-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident ATR-72-202 TS-LBB Palermo-Punta Raisi Airport (PMO)|author=Harro Ranter|date=6 August 2005|accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref>\n*The airport was a stopover for [[Air Berlin]] chartered flight AB7377, which was involved in a bomb scare. During loading at [[Hosea Kutako International Airport]] in Namibia, a suitcase was discovered that contained a clock, batteries and a firing mechanism. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the object was part of a test to assess the quality of airport screening procedures. The [[A330-200]] aircraft was examined with an explosives sniffer dog, before it was allowed to fly to [[Munich Airport]], via a stopover in Djerba.<ref>{{cite

1153]], a [[Tuninter]] [[ATR-72]] en route from Bari to [[Djerba]], [[Tunisia]], ditched into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] about 18 miles from the city of [[Palermo]]. 16 of the 39 people on board died. The accident resulted from engine [[fuel starvation]] that resulted from the installation of the wrong fuel quantity indicator. The fuel quantity indicator installed had been calibrated for the smaller [[ATR-42]] aircraft and showed significantly more fuel than was actually in the tank of the larger ATR 72. When the aircraft ran out of fuel, the indicator still showed 1800 kilograms of fuel remaining thus confusing the crew for several minutes. Both engines stopped and the crew was forced to ditch the airliner in the sea.<ref name=\"ASN\">{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050806-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident ATR-72-202 TS-LBB Palermo-Punta Raisi Airport (PMO)|author=Harro Ranter|date=6 August 2005|accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref>\n*The airport was a stopover for [[Air Berlin]] chartered flight AB7377, which was involved in a bomb scare.

He explains to Liz that the trauma of that night caused Isobel's blackouts. In 2008, at their high-school prom, Liz leaves her date, Kyle, when Alex accuses him of using an anti-gay slur. Isobel grows closer to Rosa, who wants to leave town so she can get clean, and disappears that night, sparking an argument between her brothers and her. Liz and Max go on a trip into the desert, where Max confesses his dream to be a writer. Alex and Michael discover they are attracted to each other, and hook up. Jesse catches them, and breaks Michael's hand. A drunken Rosa drives Max off just before Isobel kidnaps and smothers her in a jealous rage after previously killing two girls who had vandalized Rosa's car before blacking out, which causes her to suffer amnesia. Michael lies and says that he killed the girls, and the siblings stage a car accident to destroy the bodies. A horrified Liz tells Max she never wants to see him again.

Max is reinstated as a deputy, but denied permission to return to active duty, and Liz agrees to help Maria with her mentally ill mother Mimi, who believes in the existence of aliens, which she frequently confuses with the plot of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. Jenna questions Wyatt, who professes ignorance of trying to kill Liz, and witnesses him unconsciously sketching Max's symbol. Mimi gives Alex a vague warning about not ending up like Jim Valenti and his father, and mistakes Liz for Rosa, which she plays along with to gain her trust. This allows her to learn that Isobel confessed to being an alien to Rosa. Max discovers that Liz has been conducting experiments using his DNA to develop a serum that neutralizes alien powers; Isobel, wracked with guilt, agrees to be placed on a temporary psych hold. Max asks Liz to continue working on the serum in the hopes that it might allow his siblings and him to lead normal lives.

Alex learns from Jesse's files that Michael is an alien. With no other options, Liz turns to alien research conducted by Michael in secret, which leads her to conclude that Isobel can only be saved by using the pods to keep her in suspended animation. Deducing that silver affects the pods, Liz concocts a substance to get Isobel into one of the pods, which she consents to after overhearing Max ranting about how he wishes he loved her less.

Jenna questions Wyatt, who professes ignorance of trying to kill Liz, and witnesses him unconsciously sketching Max's symbol. Mimi gives Alex a vague warning about not ending up like Jim Valenti and his father, and mistakes Liz for Rosa, which she plays along with to gain her trust. This allows her to learn that Isobel confessed to being an alien to Rosa. Max discovers that Liz has been conducting experiments using his DNA to develop a serum that neutralizes alien powers; Isobel, wracked with guilt, agrees to be placed on a temporary psych hold.

With no other options, Liz turns to alien research conducted by Michael in secret, which leads her to conclude that Isobel can only be saved by using the pods to keep her in suspended animation. Deducing that silver affects the pods, Liz concocts a substance to get Isobel into one of the pods, which she consents to after overhearing Max ranting about how he wishes he loved her less.

{"title_page": "Chlorofluorocarbon", "text_new": "'''Chlorofluorocarbons''' ('''CFCs''') and '''hydrochlorofluorocarbons''' ('''HCFCs''') are fully or partly halogenated [[Alkane|paraffin]] hydrocarbons that contain only [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H), [[chlorine]] (Cl), and [[fluorine]] (F), produced as [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] derivative of [[methane]], [[ethane]], and [[propane]]. They are also commonly known by the [[DuPont]] brand name '''[[Freon]]'''.\n\nThe most common representative is [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs have been widely used as [[refrigerants]], propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to [[ozone depletion]] in the upper [[atmosphere]], the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]], and they are being replaced with other products such as [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110526125911/http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change \"Climate Change.\"] The White House. 6 August 2014.</ref> including [[R-410A]] and [[R-134a]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mironov | first1 = O.

Because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other, the methane-derived CFCs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry.<ref>Siegemund, G\u00fcnter ''et al.'' (2002) \"Fluorine Compounds, Organic\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}</ref>\n\nThe physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the [[halogen]] atoms. In general, they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the [[halide]]s, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at \u2212161&nbsp;\u00b0C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between \u221251.7 (CF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and \u2212128&nbsp;\u00b0C (CF<sub>4</sub>). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, in part because they contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.\n\nThe densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.\n\nCFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes. Illustrative is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from [[chloroform]]:\n:HCCl<sub>3</sub> + 2 HF \u2192 HCF<sub>2</sub>Cl + 2 HCl\nBrominated derivatives are generated by free-radical reactions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, replacing C-H bonds with C-Br bonds. The production of the [[anesthetic]] [[halothane|2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane]] (\"halothane\") is illustrative:\n:CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + Br<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CF<sub>3</sub>CHBrCl + HBr\n\n==Applications==\nCFCs and HCFCs are used in a variety of applications because of their low toxicity, reactivity and flammability. Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine. Uses include [[refrigerant]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents.\n\nBillions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as a precursor to [[tetrafluoroethylene]], the monomer that is converted into [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]].<ref name=Ullmann>Rossberg, M. et al.

It is therefore CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>.\n\nAnother equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number.

The radical Cl<sup>'''.'''</sup> is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O<sub>2</sub>. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. [[Bromine]] atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.\n\n==Impact as greenhouse gases==\nCFCs were phased out via the [[Montreal Protocol]] due to their part in [[ozone depletion]].\n\nHowever, the atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to their role as ozone-depleting chemicals.

Experimentation with chloroalkanes for fire suppression on military [[aircraft]] began at least as early as the 1920s. ''[[Freon]]'' is a trade name for a group of CFCs which are used primarily as [[refrigerant]]s, but also have uses in fire-fighting and as propellants in [[aerosol can]]s. Bromomethane is widely used as a fumigant. Dichloromethane is a versatile industrial solvent.\n\nThe Belgian scientist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Swarts]] pioneered the synthesis of CFCs in the 1890s. He developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in carbon tetrachloride with fluoride to synthesize CFC-11 (CCl<sub>3</sub>F) and CFC-12 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>).\n\nIn the late 1920s, [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] improved the process of synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[methyl chloride|chloromethane]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl), and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low [[boiling point]], low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the [[American Chemical Society]], Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle<ref>Bellis, Mary.

Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with [[Bromotrifluoromethane|Halon 1301]] was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while [[Bromochlorodifluoromethane|Halon 1211]] was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with [[warship]]s, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.\n\nBy the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the [[ozone layer]]. The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.\n\n===Regulation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nSince the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the [[Ozone depletion|ozone layer]]. After the development of his [[electron capture detector]], [[James Lovelock]] was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a [[mole fraction]] of 60 [[parts per trillion|ppt]] of CFC-11 over [[Ireland]]. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by [[Sherry Rowland]] and [[Mario Molina]] who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features\u2014their low reactivity\u2014 is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper [[stratosphere]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Bing-Sun|last2=Chiou|first2=Chung-Biau|title=The Relationship of Meteorological and Anthropogenic Factors to Time Series Measurements of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CH3CCl3 Concentrations in the Urban Atmosphere|journal=Atmospheric Environment|date=October 2008|volume=42|issue=33|page=7707|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.05.042|bibcode=2008AtmEn..42.7706L}}</ref>  Once in the stratosphere, the sun's [[ultraviolet]] radiation is strong enough to cause the [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the C-Cl bond.

[[:File:Future ozone layer concentrations.gif|Animated version]].]]\n\nBy 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over [[Antarctica]], diplomats in [[Montreal]] forged a treaty, the [[Montreal Protocol]], which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 [[European Community]] nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in [[London]] and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.\n[[File:Ozone cfc trends.png|left|thumb|Ozone-depleting gas trends]]\nBecause the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\". UNEP estimates that between 16,000\u201338,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production,<ref>[http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322071146/http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf |date=2012-03-22 }}.

The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low.

Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the [[stratosphere]] and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere.<ref name=prin/> One of these compounds, [[HFC-134a]], were used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) were also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the US and many other countries, as they had excellent thermodynamic properties and performed particularly well in high ambient temperatures. [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane]] (HCFC-141b) has replaced HFC-134a, due to its low ODP and GWP values. And according to the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is supposed to be phased out completely and replaced with zero ODP substances such as cyclopentane, HFOs, and HFC-345a before January 2020.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAmong the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf \"Greenpeace, Cool Technologies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160041/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf |date=2008-07-06 }}.

(2002) \"Fluorine Compounds, Organic\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}</ref>\n\nThe physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the [[halogen]] atoms. In general, they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the [[halide]]s, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at \u2212161&nbsp;\u00b0C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between \u221251.7 (CF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and \u2212128&nbsp;\u00b0C (CF<sub>4</sub>). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, in part because they contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.\n\nThe densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.\n\nCFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes.

Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized.

Uses include [[refrigerant]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents.\n\nBillions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as a precursor to [[tetrafluoroethylene]], the monomer that is converted into [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]].<ref name=Ullmann>Rossberg, M. et al.

It is therefore CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>.\n\nAnother equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.\n\n[[Freon]]s containing bromine are signified by four numbers.

The radical Cl<sup>'''.'''</sup> is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O<sub>2</sub>. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. [[Bromine]] atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.\n\n==Impact as greenhouse gases==\nCFCs were phased out via the [[Montreal Protocol]] due to their part in [[ozone depletion]].\n\nHowever, the atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to their role as ozone-depleting chemicals.

Experimentation with chloroalkanes for fire suppression on military [[aircraft]] began at least as early as the 1920s. ''[[Freon]]'' is a trade name for a group of CFCs which are used primarily as [[refrigerant]]s, but also have uses in fire-fighting and as propellants in [[aerosol can]]s. Bromomethane is widely used as a fumigant. Dichloromethane is a versatile industrial solvent.\n\nThe Belgian scientist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Swarts]] pioneered the synthesis of CFCs in the 1890s. He developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in carbon tetrachloride with fluoride to synthesize CFC-11 (CCl<sub>3</sub>F) and CFC-12 (CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>).\n\nIn the late 1920s, [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] improved the process of synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[methyl chloride|chloromethane]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl), and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low [[boiling point]], low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the [[American Chemical Society]], Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle<ref>Bellis, Mary.

Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with [[Bromotrifluoromethane|Halon 1301]] was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while [[Bromochlorodifluoromethane|Halon 1211]] was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with [[warship]]s, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.\n\nBy the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the [[ozone layer]]. The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.\n\n===Regulation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nSince the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the [[Ozone depletion|ozone layer]]. After the development of his [[electron capture detector]], [[James Lovelock]] was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a [[mole fraction]] of 60 [[parts per trillion|ppt]] of CFC-11 over [[Ireland]]. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by [[Sherry Rowland]] and [[Mario Molina]] who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features\u2014their low reactivity\u2014 is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper [[stratosphere]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Bing-Sun|last2=Chiou|first2=Chung-Biau|title=The Relationship of Meteorological and Anthropogenic Factors to Time Series Measurements of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CH3CCl3 Concentrations in the Urban Atmosphere|journal=Atmospheric Environment|date=October 2008|volume=42|issue=33|page=7707|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.05.042|bibcode=2008AtmEn..42.7706L}}</ref>  Once in the stratosphere, the sun's [[ultraviolet]] radiation is strong enough to cause the [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the C-Cl bond.

[[:File:Future ozone layer concentrations.gif|Animated version]].]]\n\nBy 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over [[Antarctica]], diplomats in [[Montreal]] forged a treaty, the [[Montreal Protocol]], which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 [[European Community]] nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in [[London]] and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.\n[[File:Ozone cfc trends.png|left|thumb|Ozone-depleting gas trends]]\nBecause the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\". UNEP estimates that between 16,000\u201338,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production,<ref>[http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322071146/http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf |date=2012-03-22 }}.

The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low.

Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the [[stratosphere]] and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere.<ref name=prin/> One of these compounds, [[HFC-134a]], were used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) were also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the US and many other countries, as they had excellent thermodynamic properties and performed particularly well in high ambient temperatures. [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane]] (HCFC-141b) has replaced HFC-134a, due to its low ODP and GWP values. And according to the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is supposed to be phased out completely and replaced with zero ODP substances such as cyclopentane, HFOs, and HFC-345a before January 2020.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAmong the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf \"Greenpeace, Cool Technologies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160041/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf |date=2008-07-06 }}.
