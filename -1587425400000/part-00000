{"title_page": "Wins Above Replacement", "text_new": "'''Wins Above Replacement''' or '''Wins Above Replacement Player''', commonly abbreviated to '''WAR''' or '''WARP''', is a non-standardized [[Sabermetrics|sabermetric]] [[baseball]] [[Baseball statistics|statistic]] developed to sum up \"a player's total contributions to his team\".<ref>[[#FG-WAR|Fangraphs]]: WAR</ref> A player's WAR value is claimed to be the number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a [[replacement-level player]]: a player who may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" />\n\nIndividual WAR values are calculated from the number and success rate of on-field actions by a player (in [[Batting (baseball)|batting]], [[baserunning]], [[fielding (baseball)|fielding]], and [[Pitcher|pitching]]), with higher values reflecting larger contributions to a team's [[Winning percentage|success]].<ref name=\"Schoenfield\">[[#Schoenfield|Schoenfield]]: 2012</ref> WAR value also depends on what position a player plays, with more value going to weaker hitting positions like catcher than positions with strong hitting such as first base.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" /> A high WAR value built up by a player reflects successful performance, a large quantity of playing time, or both.\n\nFor example, [[Fangraphs]] rates [[Clayton Kershaw]]'s [[2014 Major League Baseball season|2014]] [[regular season]] performance at 7.2 WAR, suggesting his team won roughly seven more games than would be expected if his innings had been pitched by a replacement level player. Kershaw achieved this high WAR total by pitching many [[Innings pitched|innings]] while maintaining a high rate of [[strikeout]]s and low rates of [[home run]]s and [[Base on balls|walks]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe basis for a WAR value is the estimated number of [[Run (baseball)|runs]] contributed by a player through offensive actions such as [[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[base running]], and runs denied to opposition teams by the player through defensive actions like [[Baseball positions|fielding]] and [[Pitcher|pitching]]. Statistics such as [[wOBA|weighted on-base average]] (wOBA), [[ultimate zone rating]] (UZR), ultimate base running (UBR), and [[defense independent pitching statistics]] (DIPS) measure the effectiveness of a player at creating and saving runs for their team, on a per-[[plate appearance]] or per-[[inning]] basis. These statistics can be multiplied by the playing time of a player to give an estimate of the number of offensive and defensive runs contributed to their team.\n\nAdditional runs contributed to a team lead to additional wins, with 10 runs estimated to be equal to roughly one win.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/win-values-explained-part-five/</ref> Therefore, a 1.0 WAR value for a player signifies a contribution of roughly 10 more runs than a [[Glossary of baseball (R)#replacement-level player|replacement-level player]], over a specified period of time. A replacement-level player is defined by Fangraphs as contributing 17.5 runs fewer than a player of league-average performance, over 600 plate appearances.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/library/war/war-position-players/</ref> Therefore, a 1.0 WAR player has contributed an estimated -7.5 runs relative to average over the same number of plate appearances, a 2.0 WAR player has contributed +2.5 runs, and a 5.0 WAR player has contributed +32.5 runs.\n\nFor an individual player, WAR values may be calculated for single seasons or parts of seasons, for several seasons, or across the whole career of the player. Collective WAR values for multiple players may also be estimated, for example to determine the contribution a team receives from its [[outfielder]]s, its [[relief pitcher]]s or from specific [[Baseball positions|positions]] such as [[catcher]].<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/mike-trout-top-ten-outfield/</ref><ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/2013-positional-power-rankings-catcher/</ref> It is also possible to [[wiktionary:extrapolate|extrapolate]] a future WAR value from a player's past performance data.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/projections/</ref>\n\n==Calculation==\nNo clearly established formula exists for WAR. Sources that provide the statistic calculate it differently. These include [[Baseball Prospectus]], [[Baseball-Reference]], and [[Fangraphs]]. All of these sources publish the method they use to calculate WAR, and all use similar basic principles to do so. The version published by Baseball Prospectus is named WARP,<ref>[[#Kaufman|Kaufman and Tan]]: 2012. Page XIV.</ref> that by Baseball-Reference is named bWAR or  rWAR (\"r\" derives from Rally or RallyMonkey, a nickname for Sean Smith, who implemented that site's version of the statistic)<ref>[[#BBREF-comparison|Baseball-Reference.com]]: WAR Comparison Chart</ref> and that for Fangraphs is named ''fWAR''.<ref>[[#FG-what|Fangraphs]]: What is WAR?</ref> Compared to rWAR, the calculation of fWAR places greater emphasis on peripheral statistics.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" />\n\nWAR values are scaled equally for pitchers and batters; that is, pitchers and position players will have roughly the same WAR if their contribution to their team is deemed similar. However, the values are calculated differently for pitchers and position players: position players are evaluated using statistics for fielding and hitting, while pitchers are evaluated using statistics related to the opposing batters' hits, walks, and strikeouts in Fangraphs' version and runs allowed per 9 innings with a team defense adjustment for Baseball-Reference's version. Because the independent WAR frameworks are calculated differently, they do not have the same scale<ref>[[#Darowski|Darowski]]: 2010</ref> and cannot be used interchangeably in an analytical context.\n\n===Position players===\n\n====Baseball-Reference====\nBaseball-Reference uses six components to calculate WAR for position players:<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomPosition\">[[#BBREF-player|Baseball-Reference.com]]: Position Player WAR Calculation and Details</ref> The components are batting runs, baserunning runs, runs added or lost due to grounding into [[double play]]s in double play situations, fielding runs, positional adjustment runs, and replacement level runs (based on playing time). The first five factors are compared to league average, so a value of 0 represents an average player.\n\n:<math>bWAR = (P_{runs} - A_{runs}) + (A_{runs} - R_{runs})</math>\n\nThe term <math>P_{runs} - A_{runs}</math> may be calculated from the first five factors, and the other term from the remaining factor.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomPosition\" />\n\nBatting runs depends on weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA), weighted to the offense of the league, and is calculated from [[wOBA]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\">[[#BR-PPWAR|Baseball-Reference.com]]: wRAA For Position Player WAR Explained</ref>\n\n:<math>wRAA = \\tfrac{wOBA - .320}{1.25} * (AB + BB +HBP + SF + SH)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>wOBA = {(\\alpha_1 * uBB + \\alpha_2 * HBP + \\alpha_3 * 1B + \\alpha_4 * 2B + \\alpha_5 * 3B + \\alpha_6 * HR + \\alpha_7 * SB - \\alpha_8 * CS) \\over (AB+BB-IBB+HBP+SF)}</math>\n\nHere, \"AB\" is the number of [[at bat]]s, \"BB\" the number of [[base on balls]] (\"uBB\" is unintentional base on balls and \"IBB\" is [[intentional base on balls]]), HBP the number of times [[hit by pitch]], \"SF\" the number of [[Sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]], \"SH\" the number of [[sacrifice hit]]s, \"1B\" the number of [[Single (baseball)|singles]], \"2B\" the number of [[Double (baseball)|doubles]], \"3B\" the number of [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], \"HR\" the number of [[home run]]s, \"SB\" the number of [[stolen base]]s, and \"CS\" the number of [[caught stealing]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> <math>\\alpha_1</math> to <math>\\alpha_8</math> represent weighting [[coefficient]]s. Baseball-Reference eliminates pitcher batting results from its data, computes linear weights and wOBA coefficients for each league, then scales the values for each league and season.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" />\n\nThe positional adjustment is a value dependent on the player's position: +10.0 for a [[catcher]], \u221210 for a [[first baseman]], +3.0 for a [[second baseman]], +2.0 for a [[third baseman]], +7.5 for a [[shortstop]], \u22127.5 for a [[left fielder]], +2.5 for a [[center fielder]], \u22127.5 for a [[right fielder]], and \u221215.0 for a [[designated hitter]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> These values are set assuming 1,350 [[inning]]s played (150 games of 9 innings).<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> A player's positional adjustment is the sum of the positional adjustment for each position played by the player scaled to the number of [[games played]] by the player at that position, normalized to 1,350 innings.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" />\n\n====Fangraphs====\nThe Fangraphs formula for position players involves offense, defense, and base running.<ref name=\"FangraphsCalculating\">[[#FG-posWAR|Fangraphs]]: Calculating WAR for Position Players</ref> These are measured using weighted Runs Above Average, [[Ultimate zone rating]] (UZR), and [[Ultimate base running]] (UBR), respectively.<ref name=\"FangraphsCalculating\" /> These values are adjusted using [[park factor]]s, and a positional adjustment is applied, resulting in a player's \"value added above league average\". To this is added a scaled value to reflect the player's value compared to a replacement-level player, which is assumed to be 20 runs below average per 600 [[plate appearance]]s.

The metric averages a player's career WAR with their seven-year peak WAR (not necessarily consecutive years). The final number is then used to measure the player's worthiness of being inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by comparing it to the average JAWS of Hall of Fame players at that position. [[Baseball-Reference]]'s explanation of JAWS says, \"The stated goal is to improve the Hall of Fame's standards, or at least to maintain them rather than erode them, by admitting players who are at least as good as the average Hall of Famer at the position, using a means via which longevity isn't the sole determinant of worthiness.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/jaws.shtml|title=Jaffe WAR Score system (JAWS)|work=[[Baseball Reference]]|first=Jay|last=Jaffe|date=2012-11-19|accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n\nFor example, as of August 5, 2013, third baseman [[Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9]] has accumulated 68.8 career WAR, and 44.9 WAR from his best seven seasons combined.

Replacement''' or '''Wins Above Replacement Player''', commonly abbreviated to '''WAR''' or '''WARP''', is a non-standardized [[Sabermetrics|sabermetric]] [[baseball]] [[Baseball statistics|statistic]] developed to sum up \"a player's total contributions to his team\".<ref>[[#FG-WAR|Fangraphs]]: WAR</ref> A player's WAR value is claimed to be the number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a [[replacement-level player]]: a player who may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" />\n\nIndividual WAR values are calculated from the number and success rate of on-field actions by a player (in [[Batting (baseball)|batting]], [[baserunning]], [[fielding (baseball)|fielding]], and [[Pitcher|pitching]]), with higher values reflecting larger contributions to a team's [[Winning percentage|success]].<ref name=\"Schoenfield\">[[#Schoenfield|Schoenfield]]: 2012</ref> WAR value also depends on what position a player plays, with more value going to weaker hitting positions like catcher than positions with strong hitting such as first base.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" /> A high WAR value built up by a player reflects successful performance, a large quantity of playing time, or both.\n\nFor example, [[Fangraphs]] rates [[Clayton Kershaw]]'s [[2014 Major League Baseball season|2014]] [[regular season]] performance at 7.2 WAR, suggesting his team won roughly seven more games than would be expected if his innings had been pitched by a replacement level player. Kershaw achieved this high WAR total by pitching many [[Innings pitched|innings]] while maintaining a high rate of [[strikeout]]s and low rates of [[home run]]s and [[Base on balls|walks]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe basis for a WAR value is the estimated number of [[Run (baseball)|runs]] contributed by a player through offensive actions such as [[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[base running]], and runs denied to opposition teams by the player through defensive actions like [[Baseball positions|fielding]] and [[Pitcher|pitching]]. Statistics such as [[wOBA|weighted on-base average]] (wOBA), [[ultimate zone rating]] (UZR), ultimate base running (UBR), and [[defense independent pitching statistics]] (DIPS) measure the effectiveness of a player at creating and saving runs for their team, on a per-[[plate appearance]] or per-[[inning]] basis. These statistics can be multiplied by the playing time of a player to give an estimate of the number of offensive and defensive runs contributed to their team.\n\nAdditional runs contributed to a team lead to additional wins, with 10 runs estimated to be equal to roughly one win.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/win-values-explained-part-five/</ref> Therefore, a 1.0 WAR value for a player signifies a contribution of roughly 10 more runs than a [[Glossary of baseball (R)#replacement-level player|replacement-level player]], over a specified period of time. A replacement-level player is defined by Fangraphs as contributing 17.5 runs fewer than a player of league-average performance, over 600 plate appearances.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/library/war/war-position-players/</ref> Therefore, a 1.0 WAR player has contributed an estimated -7.5 runs relative to average over the same number of plate appearances, a 2.0 WAR player has contributed +2.5 runs, and a 5.0 WAR player has contributed +32.5 runs.\n\nFor an individual player, WAR values may be calculated for single seasons or parts of seasons, for several seasons, or across the whole career of the player. Collective WAR values for multiple players may also be estimated, for example to determine the contribution a team receives from its [[outfielder]]s, its [[relief pitcher]]s or from specific [[Baseball positions|positions]] such as [[catcher]].<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/mike-trout-top-ten-outfield/</ref><ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/2013-positional-power-rankings-catcher/</ref> It is also possible to [[wiktionary:extrapolate|extrapolate]] a future WAR value from a player's past performance data.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/projections/</ref>\n\n==Calculation==\nNo clearly established formula exists for WAR. Sources that provide the statistic calculate it differently. These include [[Baseball Prospectus]], [[Baseball-Reference]], and [[Fangraphs]]. All of these sources publish the method they use to calculate WAR, and all use similar basic principles to do so. The version published by Baseball Prospectus is named WARP,<ref>[[#Kaufman|Kaufman and Tan]]: 2012. Page XIV.</ref> that by Baseball-Reference is named bWAR or  rWAR (\"r\" derives from Rally or RallyMonkey, a nickname for Sean Smith, who implemented that site's version of the statistic)<ref>[[#BBREF-comparison|Baseball-Reference.com]]: WAR Comparison Chart</ref> and that for Fangraphs is named ''fWAR''.<ref>[[#FG-what|Fangraphs]]: What is WAR?</ref> Compared to rWAR, the calculation of fWAR places greater emphasis on peripheral statistics.<ref name=\"Schoenfield\" />\n\nWAR values are scaled equally for pitchers and batters; that is, pitchers and position players will have roughly the same WAR if their contribution to their team is deemed similar. However, the values are calculated differently for pitchers and position players: position players are evaluated using statistics for fielding and hitting, while pitchers are evaluated using statistics related to the opposing batters' hits, walks, and strikeouts in Fangraphs' version and runs allowed per 9 innings with a team defense adjustment for Baseball-Reference's version. Because the independent WAR frameworks are calculated differently, they do not have the same scale<ref>[[#Darowski|Darowski]]: 2010</ref> and cannot be used interchangeably in an analytical context.\n\n===Position players===\n\n====Baseball-Reference====\nBaseball-Reference uses six components to calculate WAR for position players:<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomPosition\">[[#BBREF-player|Baseball-Reference.com]]: Position Player WAR Calculation and Details</ref> The components are batting runs, baserunning runs, runs added or lost due to grounding into [[double play]]s in double play situations, fielding runs, positional adjustment runs, and replacement level runs (based on playing time). The first five factors are compared to league average, so a value of 0 represents an average player.\n\n:<math>bWAR = (P_{runs} - A_{runs}) + (A_{runs} - R_{runs})</math>\n\nThe term <math>P_{runs} - A_{runs}</math> may be calculated from the first five factors, and the other term from the remaining factor.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomPosition\" />\n\nBatting runs depends on weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA), weighted to the offense of the league, and is calculated from [[wOBA]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\">[[#BR-PPWAR|Baseball-Reference.com]]: wRAA For Position Player WAR Explained</ref>\n\n:<math>wRAA = \\tfrac{wOBA - .320}{1.25} * (AB + BB +HBP + SF + SH)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>wOBA = {(\\alpha_1 * uBB + \\alpha_2 * HBP + \\alpha_3 * 1B + \\alpha_4 * 2B + \\alpha_5 * 3B + \\alpha_6 * HR + \\alpha_7 * SB - \\alpha_8 * CS) \\over (AB+BB-IBB+HBP+SF)}</math>\n\nHere, \"AB\" is the number of [[at bat]]s, \"BB\" the number of [[base on balls]] (\"uBB\" is unintentional base on balls and \"IBB\" is [[intentional base on balls]]), HBP the number of times [[hit by pitch]], \"SF\" the number of [[Sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]], \"SH\" the number of [[sacrifice hit]]s, \"1B\" the number of [[Single (baseball)|singles]], \"2B\" the number of [[Double (baseball)|doubles]], \"3B\" the number of [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], \"HR\" the number of [[home run]]s, \"SB\" the number of [[stolen base]]s, and \"CS\" the number of [[caught stealing]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> <math>\\alpha_1</math> to <math>\\alpha_8</math> represent weighting [[coefficient]]s. Baseball-Reference eliminates pitcher batting results from its data, computes linear weights and wOBA coefficients for each league, then scales the values for each league and season.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" />\n\nThe positional adjustment is a value dependent on the player's position: +10.0 for a [[catcher]], \u221210 for a [[first baseman]], +3.0 for a [[second baseman]], +2.0 for a [[third baseman]], +7.5 for a [[shortstop]], \u22127.5 for a [[left fielder]], +2.5 for a [[center fielder]], \u22127.5 for a [[right fielder]], and \u221215.0 for a [[designated hitter]].<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> These values are set assuming 1,350 [[inning]]s played (150 games of 9 innings).<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" /> A player's positional adjustment is the sum of the positional adjustment for each position played by the player scaled to the number of [[games played]] by the player at that position, normalized to 1,350 innings.<ref name=\"BaseballReferencecomwRAA\" />\n\n====Fangraphs====\nThe Fangraphs formula for position players involves offense, defense, and base running.<ref name=\"FangraphsCalculating\">[[#FG-posWAR|Fangraphs]]: Calculating WAR for Position Players</ref> These are measured using weighted Runs Above Average, [[Ultimate zone rating]] (UZR), and [[Ultimate base running]] (UBR), respectively.<ref name=\"FangraphsCalculating\" /> These values are adjusted using [[park factor]]s, and a positional adjustment is applied, resulting in a player's \"value added above league average\". To this is added a scaled value to reflect the player's value compared to a replacement-level player, which is assumed to be 20 runs below average per 600 [[plate appearance]]s. All four values are measured in runs.\n\n:<math>fWAR = wRAA + UZR + Position + \\tfrac{20}{600}*PA</math>\n\nThe positional adjustment is a value dependent on the players position: +12.5 for a catcher, \u221212.5 for a first baseman, +2.5 for a second or third baseman, +7.5 for a shortstop, \u22127.5 for a left fielder, +2.5 for a center fielder, \u22127.5 for a right fielder, and \u221217.5 for a designated hitter.<ref name=\"Cameron\">[[#Cameron|Cameron]]: 2008</ref> These values are scaled to the number of games played by the player at each position.<ref name=\"Cameron\" />\n\n===Pitchers===\n\n====Baseball-Reference====\nBaseball-Reference uses two components to calculate WAR for pitchers:  Runs Allowed (both earned and unearned) and Innings Pitched.

The final number is then used to measure the player's worthiness of being inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by comparing it to the average JAWS of Hall of Fame players at that position. [[Baseball-Reference]]'s explanation of JAWS says, \"The stated goal is to improve the Hall of Fame's standards, or at least to maintain them rather than erode them, by admitting players who are at least as good as the average Hall of Famer at the position, using a means via which longevity isn't the sole determinant of worthiness.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/jaws.shtml|title=Jaffe WAR Score system (JAWS)|work=[[Baseball Reference]]|first=Jay|last=Jaffe|date=2012-11-19|accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>\n\nFor example, as of August 5, 2013, third baseman [[Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9]] has accumulated 68.8 career WAR, and 44.9 WAR from his best seven seasons combined.

An emphasis was placed on trying to understand the overarching phenomena of a psychological concept and how it connects with other ideas. This also led to a focus on problem-solving as a learning theory to be explored in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giordano|first=Gerard|date=1981|title=The Re-emergence of Gestalt Psychology and Implications For Reading Readiness|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=14|issue=3|pages=121\u2013171|doi=10.1177/002221948101400303|pmid=7229536|issn=0022-2194}}</ref>\n\nIn America, a strong focus was on [[behaviorism]] which focused on exploring observable psychological concepts. Many concepts explored learning mechanisms that could be tested on animals.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Russia, or the Soviet Union at the time, provided a cultural-historical approach towards psychology which described learning in the context of one's environment.<ref name=\":2\" /> This perspective viewed learning as a concept that can be directed and supported in institutions like schools. Another significant theory is [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] which described learning as a way learners can construct their knowledge by expanding and changing their ideas based on the information they received.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barrouillet|first=Pierre|date=2015|title=Theories of cognitive development: From Piaget to today|journal=Developmental Review|volume=38|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.004}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychoanalysis]] and [[John Dewey]]'s theories on schooling and learning were also major contributions during this time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1950s\u201360s ===\nAfter the second world war, two major strands of learning psychological theories became very prominent. One was the rise of extreme behaviorism which stemmed from the work by [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Theories of personality|last=Schultz, Duane P.|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|others=Schultz, Sydney Ellen.|isbn=978-0-495-50625-6|edition=9th|location=Australia|oclc=181600768}}</ref> Skinner viewed human behavior as determined by the individual's interactions with one's environment.<ref name=\":0\" /> He argued that humans are controlled by external factors such that human learning is predicated on the environmental information one receives from one's surroundings.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, more humanistic qualities such as identity, hope, love, care, and so forth were neglected in his work.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, from the 1960s, due to the rise of [[cognitive science]], much of the different types of learning beyond behaviorism were expanded. Psychologists started to consider more complicated forms of learning such as [[Albert Bandura]]'s concept of [[social learning theory|social learning]] and Dane [[Thomas Nissen]]'s learning theory of culmination which could not be explained adequately through behaviorism.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, although behaviorism grew after the second world war, the field started to move away from behaviorism in the 1960s.\n\nIn addition to behaviorism, a more [[humanistic]] view of psychology, lead by psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]], grew.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> In 1951, Rogers introduced the concepts of client-based therapy and introduced related terms such as \"student-centered teacher\" and \"significant learning.\" [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] model influenced the psychology of learning as well as it describes how people need to meet their basic physical, social, and mental needs before they can address their more cognitive needs such as learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs|title=Our Hierarchy of Needs|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Other psychologists, such as [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Erik Erikson]], played a major role too. Lewin brought about [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]] which contributed much to [[group psychology]] and learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Erikson's work on identity development furthered the understand of youth learning and scholars from the Frankfurt school furthered understandings about authoritarianism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== 1970s\u2013===\nDuring the 1970s, different theories and dispositions towards learning started to occur. Learning began to be viewed as an integral part of life and the world as it started to be seen as a part of personal and social enrichment. Concepts such as [[lifelong learning]] and [[adult education]] started to appear as people began to view learning as a daily process throughout life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLearning also started to be connected with liberation and [[emancipation]].

This approach viewed learning as interacting with incentives in the environment. For instance, [[Ute Holzkamp-Osterkamp]] viewed [[motivation]] as being interconnected with learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s zone of proximal development influenced educators to view learning activities in relation to the students' proximal zone of development.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Vygotsky : a quest for synthesis|last=Veer, Ren\u00e9 van der, 1952-|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|others=Valsiner, Jaan.|isbn=0-631-16528-2|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=22543795}}</ref> This cultural-historical approach shifted educators' approach to consider the backgrounds and interests of their students when crafting their lessons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLearning ideas also started to have a more social approach.

Each of their contributions furthered our knowledge of this new and noteworthy [[theoretical science]].\n\n===Socrates===\n[[Socrates]] (469-399 B.C.) introduced a method of learning known as piloting, through which one arrives at one's own answers through power of reasoning. Socrates, in dialogue with Meno, taught this method, by teaching a slave boy, who knew nothing about the Euclidean geometry, the Pythagorean theorem. He did so by asking questions or rephrasing them until the correct answer was found. Socrates strongly influenced the idea that knowledge is innate and can be found from within, it is also known as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]].<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Meno|last=Plato|publisher=80e, Grube translation|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Hermann Ebbinghaus===\n[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20141909) examined learning, by studying rote memory and forgetting. With himself as his own experimental subject, he used meaningless syllables form lists that read several times until he could restated them with high accuracy. Additionally, he attempted to recall the same lists with certain delay (e.g., a few days or months later) and then recorded his discoveries as [[learning curve]]s and the [[forgetting curve]]s.<ref name=hist/>\n\n===Edward Thorndike===\n[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) presented his theory of the \"Law of Effect\" in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology|last=Myers|first=David G.|last2=Dewall|first2=C. Nathan|publisher=Worth publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4641-4081-5|location=New York, NY|pages=290}}</ref> According to this theory, humans and other animals learn behaviors through trial-and-error methods. Once a functioning solution is found, these behaviors are likely to be repeated during the same or similar task.<ref name=thorndike/> It was his work on learning theory that resulted in [[operant conditioning]] within behaviorism. His theory of operant conditioning is learning from the consequences of our actions and behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/edward-thorndike.html|title=Edward Thorndike - Law of Effect {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===Ivan Pavlov===\n[[Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) was a Russian physiologist, who contributed to research on learning. Knowing that a hungry dog salivates when food is present, he performed a series of experiments and trained dogs to salivate through an arbitrary external stimuli. This was done by pairing natural stimuli (such as food) with a new stimulus (e.g., a metronome) to provoke the desired response in dogs. That proved his thesis that he could make a dog salivate by just the presentation of the sound of a bell. Pavlov's approach to learning was behavioristic and later known as [[classical conditioning]].[[Psychology of learning#cite note-9|<sup>[9]</sup>]]\n\n=== John Broadus Watson ===\n[[John Broadus Watson]] (1878\u20131958) also used this method of learning (e.g., he caused a young child, not previously afraid of furry animals, to become frightened of them) and argued that it was sufficient for the science of psychology, specifically [[behaviorism]].<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the History of Psychology|last=Hergenhahn|first=B.

From 1920-1960, this school influenced a great deal of North American psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/intro.htm|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Introduction to Watson (1913) by C.D.

Skinner]] (1904-1990) developed [[operant conditioning]], in which specific behaviors resulted from stimuli, which caused them to appear more or less frequently.<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology|last=Myers|first=David G.|last2=Dewall|first2=C.

Watson's ideas had become popular and influential in the world of psychology and classical conditioning was being explored by other behaviorists. Skinner's was one of these behaviorists. He thought that in order to understand behavior we needed to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this operant conditioning. Skinner is referred to as the father of operant conditioning but his theory stems from the works presented by Edward Thorndike.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html|title=B.F. Skinner {{!}} Operant Conditioning {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===Jean Piaget===\n[[Jean Piaget]] is known for his theory of cognitive development that describes how children create a mental model of the world around them. His theory is important because it is one of the first theories that disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a steadfast trait. His theory sees cognitive development as something that happens because of biological maturation and one's interaction with their surrounding environment. Piaget did not want to measure a child's knowledge, like an [[Intelligence quotient|I.Q]]. score, instead he focused on how children did with fundamental concepts. Piaget's theory has four stages. The [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor stage|sensorimotor]] stage which is birth to 18\u201324 months. The [[preoperational]] stage is toddler ages (18\u201324 months) to early childhood, age 7. The [[Concrete Operational|concrete operational]] stage, ages 7 to 12. Then the [[Formal Operational|formal operation]] stage which is adolescence to adulthood. Before Piaget's theory it was believed that children were just less competent thinkers but this theory and his stages helped to show that children think in significantly differently ways than adults do''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|title=Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>\n\n===Lev Vygotsky===\n[[Lev Vygotsky]] is best known for his theory in cognitive development known as [[social development theory]]. Vygotsky was developing his theories of [[cognitive development]] around the same time that Jean Piaget was developing his theories. Vygotsky believed that social interaction plays a critical role in cognitive development. He places a large emphasis on culture and how it affects cognitive development. He also sees the importance of adults in cognitive development in children. Vygotsky says that development cannot be understood without referring back to the social and also the cultural context in which it is embedded. Vygotsky claimed that learning occurs via skillful interaction in which the child is with someone who models behaviors or gives instructions for the child to follow, most likely a parent or a teacher. The child tries to understand the instructions or actions provided and then stores the information so they can use it to guide their future performances. Piaget's theory says that a child's development must follow their learning, Vygotsky disagreed with this. He believed that social learning tends to come before development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|title=Vygotsky {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Psychology of learning theories ==\n[[Learning theory (education)|Learning theories]] are attempts to better understand and explain learning processes. There are several different theories that account for learning.\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe neuroscience of learning focuses on the relationships among the central nervous system, learning, and behavior.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> This central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord which are responsible for controlling behavior. This differs from the autonomic nervous system which relates with more autonomous functions such as respiration and digestion. Within the CNS, there are neurons, which send messages within and from the brain to the rest of body through electrical and chemical signals. The CNS also has glial cells which assist neurons in the communication process.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience : exploring the brain|last=Bear, Mark F.|others=Connors, Barry W.,, Paradiso, Michael A.|isbn=978-0-7817-7817-6|edition=Fourth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=897825779|year = 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience|others=Purves, Dale|isbn=978-1-60535-380-7|edition=Sixth|location=New York|oclc=990257568|date = 4 July 2018}}</ref> These neurons communicate and form connections, also called consolidation, to form a person's cognition. Hence, learning, from a neuroscience perspective, focuses on how the organization of this neural network changes through the use and reception of information.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNeuroscience has an explanation for the acquisition of memory. In the brain, there are two types of memory called working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM).<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> WM is memory of immediate thoughts; it is a memory that collects, organizes, and retains sensory information for a short time. Information in WM needs to be repeated in order to be retained. LTM, also called permanent memory, is memory that is retained for the long-term. Hence, a concept is considered \"learned\" when information from WM enters and gets stored into LTM.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nNeuroscience also plays a role in related areas such as motivation and self-regulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivation : biological, psychological, and environmental|last=Deckers, Lambert.|isbn=978-0-205-94100-1|edition=Fourth|location=Boston|oclc=841559013|date = 10 July 2013}}</ref> Motivation, a psychological component related to learning, also has an explanation through neuroscience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miendlarzewska|first=Ewa A.|last2=Bavelier|first2=Daphne|last3=Schwartz|first3=Sophie|date=2016|title=Influence of reward motivation on human declarative memory|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=61|pages=156\u2013176|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.11.015|pmid=26657967|doi-access=free}}</ref> Overall, the brain has a disposition towards rewards and outcomes related to pleasure. In fact, it bring out certain chemical and opiates that give a natural high increasing a person's motivation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Self-regulation, which plays a significant factor into learning, are also represented by the brain's synaptic connections. These particular connections between self-regulatory activities and tasks help people to regulate their learning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Behaviorism ===\n[[Behaviorism]] views knowledge as a collection of behavioral responses towards different stimuli in the environment. In behaviorism, learning is promoted by positive reinforcement and reiteration. Throughout the history of psychology, there have been many different behaviorist learning theories. All these theories relate stimulus with response such that a person or animal learns and changes its behavior based upon the stimulus it receives. One significant theory proposed by B.F, Skinner is operant conditioning.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R.|last2=Cerutti|first2=D. T.|date=2003|title=Operant Conditioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115\u2013144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|issn=0066-4308|pmc=1473025|pmid=12415075}}</ref> This theory claims that the consequences from behaviors will determine future behavior. Consequences to behavior that are positive, and therefore reinforcing, will increase the corresponding behavior. However, consequences that are punishing will decrease behavior.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn a behaviorist perspective, motivation is due to the consequences of behavior and hence completely external. If a consequence is positive, that will further increase one's motivation and eventually one's behavior. On the other hand, if a consequence is negative, one's motivation and behavior will decrease. Behaviorism exists in many current models for learning such as rewards and consequences in classrooms and other incentives like having content mastery goals.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, it does not account for all aspects of learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> Memory, for instance, is not addressed as behaviorism does not consider internal processes. Nevertheless, learning surrounding behaviorism is still very prevalent today.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Social cognitive theory ===\nSocial cognitive theory proposes that much of human learning occurs through the social environment.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Many ideas surrounding social cognitive theory were proposed by Albert Bandura, a clinical psychologist. Unlike behaviorism, which argues that learning is caused through the reinforcement of actions and routines, social cognitive theory provides a cognitive component for learning.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bandura|first=Albert|chapter=Social Cognitive Theory of Social Referencing|date=1992|pages=175\u2013208|editor-last=Feinman|editor-first=Saul|publisher=Springer US|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2462-9_8|isbn=978-1-4899-2464-3|title=Social Referencing and the Social Construction of Reality in Infancy}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Social learning theory|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1977|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-816751-6|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=|oclc=2635133}}</ref> For instance, learning can occur purely through observation, where a person can gain knowledge of a concept or acquire an understanding of a rule, attitude, beliefs, without actually acting out any of these respective ideas.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModels also play a significant great role in learning according to social cognitive theory. For instance, a person can gain useful knowledge and understanding through information gained from the model. However, solely observing models does not guarantee one will master the concepts represented in the model. Instead, these models provide information about possible outcomes and inform how the observer should act.<ref name=\":8\" /> Hence, while learning can occur without actually partaking in any enactive learning (learning by doing), the social cognitive theory learning is most effective when it is done enactively and vicariously (learning through observation).<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nSocial cognitive theory describes human behavior as agentic meaning that humans have intentions and agendas that drive their behavior. This perspective explains lot of human learning behavior such as setting goals and regulating one's thoughts, emotions, and behavior for the purpose of learning.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Information processing theories ===\nInformation processing theories focus on the ways information is collected, analyzed, and stored in the human brain.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Tangen|first=Jodi L.|last2=Borders|first2=L. DiAnne|date=2017|title=Applying Information Processing Theory to Supervision: An Initial Exploration|journal=Counselor Education and Supervision|volume=56|issue=2|pages=98\u2013111|doi=10.1002/ceas.12065|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/L_Borders_Applying_2017.pdf}}</ref> While there is no single information processing theory, there are several theories that can be categorized about information processing theory.<ref name=\":1\" /> One model, proposed by many information processing theorists, is the two-store memory model. Also called the dual memory model, the two-store memory model describes learning as storing information and knowledge from one's environment into one's short-term memory (STM) and eventually into one's long-term memory (LTM).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memory and aging : current issues and future directions|date=2012|publisher=Psychology Press|others=Naveh-Benjamin, Moshe., Ohta, Nobuo.|isbn=978-1-136-58302-5|location=New York|oclc=795124261}}</ref> To elaborate, information about your environment is collected through your senses. This information is then entered into your STM, also called working memory (WM).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richter|first=Kim Merle|last2=M\u00f6dden|first2=Claudia|last3=Eling|first3=Paul|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Helmut|date=2015|title=Working Memory Training and Semantic Structuring Improves Remembering Future Events, Not Past Events|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|language=|volume=29|issue=1|pages=33\u201340|doi=10.1177/1545968314527352|pmid=24699430|issn=1545-9683|hdl=2066/135098|hdl-access=free}}</ref> From the STM, some of this information is rehearsed and eventually encoded into the LTM where it is then stored permanently.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAlternate models have been proposed in regards to how information is processed. For instance, some argue that that there is one type of memory in the brain which has different levels of processing within it. Nevertheless, the classical model poses memory as dual memory (short-term and long-term) model.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother related theory is the dual-code theory which splits the brain processes into two systems: an imaginal system and a verbal system. The imaginal system primarily stores concrete events and objects while the verbal system stores more abstract information from language. This theory also allows for knowledge transfer within both systems as images, expressed through verbal language, can be encoded and placed into the imaginal system.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Kousta|first=Stavroula-Thaleia|last2=Vigliocco|first2=Gabriella|last3=Vinson|first3=David P.|last4=Andrews|first4=Mark|last5=Del Campo|first5=Elena|date=2011|title=The representation of abstract words: Why emotion matters.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=140|issue=1|pages=14\u201334|doi=10.1037/a0021446|pmid=21171803|issn=1939-2222}}</ref>\n\nWhile these theories can be traced back to gestalt psychology, much of the these theories were influenced by the rise of technology, neuroscience, and communications.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Constructivism ===\nConstructivism is a philosophical perspective which argues that much of what one learns and understands about the world is constructed.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=Constructivism : theory, perspectives, and practice|date=2005|publisher=Teachers College Press|others=Fosnot, Catherine Twomey.|isbn=0-8077-4570-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=57040003}}</ref> Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cognitive constructivism ====\n[[Cognitive constructivism]], stemming from Jean Piaget's theories, sees learning as adding new information to cognitive structures that are already there. Piaget's theory claim that people cognitively develop by passing through several stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Piaget's theory of cognitive and affective development|last=Wadsworth, Barry J.|date=2004|publisher=Pearson/A and B|isbn=0-205-40603-3|edition=Classic ed., 5th|location=Boston|oclc=53807097}}</ref>\n\nThe sensorimotor stage, which occurs from birth to around age 2, is when children act spontaneously to make sense of their world. Much of these actions are sensory in nature (e.g. touching) and rooted in present action. The preoperational stage occurs between ages 2 to 7 and is categorized by children being able to reflect briefly on the past and imagine the future.<ref name=\":12\" /> However, in the preoperational stage, most of one's thinking in this stage is still grounded in one's experiences in the present. The concrete operational stage, which occurs between ages 7 to 11, is when children rapidly grow cognitively and drastically improve their basic skills and language. Here, children can demonstrate some abstract thinking although much of this thinking is still grounded by actions.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> The formal operational stage, which starts around age 11 and goes on to adulthood, is the last developmental stage in Piaget's theory. This stage expands upon the concrete operational stage by using higher levels of thinking such as hypothetical thinking, more developed abstract thinking, and idealistic thinking.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nThroughout these motivational stages, the mechanism in which the children and people learn, is through a concept called equilibrium. This mechanism is the process where an individual is able to resolve cognitive conflicts by either applying one's beliefs to one's experiences (a process called assimilation) or by changing one's beliefs to accommodate new experiences and information when encountering new situations or concepts.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Social constructivism ====\n[[Social constructivism]], like its name suggests, believes that knowledge and learning is gained within social situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gsi.berkeley.edu/gsi-guide-contents/learning-theory-research/learning-overview/|title=Overview of Learning Theories {{!}} GSI Teaching & Resource Center|website=gsi.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Lead by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, social constructivism has a more sociocultural approach. This approach argues that the social environment facilitates learning through certain tools such objects, language, and organizations. Through these tools, cognitive learning occurs when the people interact with these tools socially and internalize them.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Vygotsky for educators|last=Karpov, Yuriy V., 1957-|isbn=978-1-107-06542-0|location=New York, NY|oclc=871343716|date = 9 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nA major concept within social constructivism is the zone of proximal development (ZPD). ZPD represents the potential amount of learning a student can have given the right environmental conditions. This model suggests that the teacher and student work together to further the student's learning. Educational examples of this include instructional scaffolding and apprenticeships where the educator takes an invested and active role in furthering the knowledge of the student.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Motivation ===\nVarious motivational theories play a role in the psychology of learning. [[John William Atkinson]]'s motivation theory argues that people are motivated to achieve their best. This motivation is in part moderated by two different sources: the desire to succeed as well as the fear of failure.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another motivational theory is [[Allan Wigfield]]'s and [[Jacquelynne Eccles]]'s expectancy-value theory which states that motivation is moderated by one's desire for success as well as the importance of the tasks one needs to do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigfield|first=Allan|last2=Eccles|first2=Jacquelynne S.|date=2000|title=Expectancy\u2013Value Theory of Achievement Motivation|journal=Contemporary Educational Psychology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=68\u201381|doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1015|pmid=10620382}}</ref> Self-worth theory also plays a role in learning as students and individuals are motivated to learn and achieve because of their desire to maintain their perception of being high achieving.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Goal theory]] is another related theory. Learners usually have two types of goals: learning mastery goals (e.g. learning a new concept) and performance goals (e.g. being first place). This theory suggests that mastery goals are more effective than performance goals as a motivator. This is because performance goals may cause people to do more social comparison, such as comparing oneself to others, which may ineffectively raise motivation.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Mindsets related to learning also play into motivation. Psychologist [[Carol Dweck]] distinguished differences between the growth mindset, the idea that ability is malleable, and the fixed mindset, the idea that ability is fixed. People who incorporate a growth mindset on a certain task tend to have higher motivation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mindset : the new psychology of success|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|date=2006|publisher=Random House|isbn=1-4000-6275-6|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=|oclc=58546262|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mindsetnewpsycho00dwec}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of competence and motivation : theory and application|others=Elliot, Andrew J.,, Dweck, Carol S., 1946-, Yeager, David S.|isbn=978-1-4625-2960-5|edition=Second|location=New York|oclc=961457526|date = 28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Attribution theory]], which discusses how people perceive and attribute a certain behavior or outcome to a certain characteristic, also relates to motivation and learning. According to [[Bernie Weiner]]'s attribution model, students attribute their academic achievement based on effort, ability, and luck. The way an individual attributes his or her academic performance will determine that person's level of motivation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTheories related to control also have a major impact to learning. When people begin to perceive that their performance outcomes are not related to their own effort, this can severely limit motivation. At the most extreme, this can lead to learned helplessness which is when a person is experiencing a negative cycle where one's negative beliefs interactions with one's academic failures and motivation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maier|first=Steven F.|last2=Seligman|first2=Martin E.

[[Intrinsic motivation]] is an inherent type of motivation that one engages as an end to itself. [[Extrinsic motivation]], on the other hand, is a motivation that is provided externally such as external awards or punishments. Research has shown that incentives which reward task engagement lowers intrinsic motivation as it is much like controlling behavior. However, rewards related to one's performance are more effective which can help further one's skill, motivation, and self-efficacy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intrinsic motivation|last=Deci, Edward L.|date=1975|publisher=Plenum Press|isbn=0-306-34401-7|location=New York|pages=|oclc=1500344|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intrinsicmotivat00deci}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Educational Psychology]]\n* [[Learning]]\n* [[Media psychology]]\n* [[Learning theory (education)]]\n* [[Classical conditioning]]\n* [[Operant conditioning]]\n\n==References==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=psychology of learning}}\n\n{{reflist | refs=\n<ref name=hist><Marton, Ference, and Shirley Booth.

Some take on a more behaviorist approach which focuses on inputs and reinforcements.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Illeris|first=Knud|date=2018|title=An overview of the history of learning theory|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=53|issue=1|pages=86\u2013101|doi=10.1111/ejed.12265|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|last=Schunk, Dale H.|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Psychology : modules for active learning|last=Coon, Dennis.|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Engage Learning|others=Mitterer, John O.|isbn=978-1-111-34286-9|edition=12th|location=Australia|oclc=651909049}}</ref> Other approaches, such as theories related to [[neuroscience]] and [[social cognition]], focus more on the brain's organization and structure to define learning.

An emphasis was placed on trying to understand the overarching phenomena of a psychological concept and how it connects with other ideas. This also lead to a focus on problem-solving as a learning theory to be explored in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giordano|first=Gerard|date=1981|title=The Re-emergence of Gestalt Psychology and Implications For Reading Readiness|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=14|issue=3|pages=121\u2013171|doi=10.1177/002221948101400303|pmid=7229536|issn=0022-2194}}</ref>\n\nIn America, a strong focus was on [[behaviorism]] which focused on exploring observable psychological concepts. Many concepts explored learning mechanisms that could be tested on animals.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Russia, or the Soviet Union at the time, provided a cultural-historical approach towards psychology which described learning in the context of one's environment.<ref name=\":2\" /> This perspective viewed learning as a concept that can be directed and supported in institutions like schools. Another significant theory is [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] which described learning as a way learners can construct their knowledge by expanding and changing their ideas based on the information they received.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barrouillet|first=Pierre|date=2015|title=Theories of cognitive development: From Piaget to today|journal=Developmental Review|volume=38|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.004}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychoanalysis]] and [[John Dewey]]'s theories on schooling and learning were also major contributions during this time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1950s\u201360s ===\nAfter the second world war, two major strands of learning psychological theories became very prominent. One was the rise of extreme behaviorism which stemmed from the work by [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Theories of personality|last=Schultz, Duane P.|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|others=Schultz, Sydney Ellen.|isbn=978-0-495-50625-6|edition=9th|location=Australia|oclc=181600768}}</ref> Skinner viewed human behavior as determined by the individual's interactions with one's environment.<ref name=\":0\" /> He argued that humans are controlled by external factors such that human learning is predicated on the environmental information one receives from one's surroundings.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, more humanistic qualities such as identity, hope, love, care, and so forth were neglected in his work.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, from the 1960s, due to the rise of [[cognitive science]], much of the different types of learning beyond behaviorism were expanded. Psychologists started to consider more complicated forms of learning such as [[Albert Bandura]]'s concept of [[social learning theory|social learning]] and Dane [[Thomas Nissen]]'s learning theory of culmination which could not be explained adequately through behaviorism.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, although behaviorism grew after the second world war, the field started to move away from behaviorism in the 1960s.\n\nIn addition to behaviorism, a more [[humanistic]] view of psychology, lead by psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]], grew.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> In 1951, Rogers introduced the concepts of client-based therapy and introduced related terms such as \"student-centered teacher\" and \"significant learning.\" [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] model influenced the psychology of learning as well as it describes how people need to meet their basic physical, social, and mental needs before they can address their more cognitive needs such as learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs|title=Our Hierarchy of Needs|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Other psychologists, such as [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Erik Erikson]], played a major role too. Lewin brought about [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]] which contributed much to [[group psychology]] and learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Erikson's work on identity development furthered the understand of youth learning and scholars from the Frankfurt school furthered understandings about authoritarianism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== 1970s\u2013===\nDuring the 1970s, different theories and dispositions towards learning started to occur. Learning began to be viewed as an integral part of life and the world as it started to be seen as a part of personal and social enrichment. Concepts such as [[lifelong learning]] and [[adult education]] started to appear as people began to view learning as a daily process throughout life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLearning also started to be connected with liberation and [[emancipation]]. Scholars such as [[C. Wright Mills|Charles Wright Mills]] and [[Paulo Freire]] applied learning as a way to understand and eventually reform the systemic power conditions that exists in society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brewer|first=John D.|date=2004|title=Imagining The Sociological Imagination: the biographical context of a sociological classic|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=317\u2013333|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2004.00022.x|pmid=15383090|issn=0007-1315}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|last=Freire, Paulo, 1921-1997.|date=2000|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1276-9|edition=30th anniversary|location=New York|oclc=43929806}}</ref> [[Jack Mezirow]] created [[transformational learning]] where learning can transform the habits and perspectives of individuals in order to fundamentally transform.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mezirow|first=Jack|date=1994|title=Understanding Transformation Theory|journal=Adult Education Quarterly|volume=44|issue=4|pages=222\u2013232|doi=10.1177/074171369404400403|issn=0741-7136}}</ref> In essence, learning theory was broadened to include the social contexts surrounding the learning process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Russian cultural-historical approach started to be adopted. This approach viewed learning as interacting with incentives in the environment. For instance, [[Ute Holzkamp-Osterkamp]] viewed [[motivation]] as being interconnected with learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s zone of proximal development influenced educators to view learning activities in relation to the students' proximal zone of development.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Vygotsky : a quest for synthesis|last=Veer, Ren\u00e9 van der, 1952-|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|others=Valsiner, Jaan.|isbn=0-631-16528-2|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=22543795}}</ref> This cultural-historical approach shifted educators' approach to consider the backgrounds and interests of their students when crafting their lessons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLearning ideas also started to have a more social approach. [[Kenneth J. Gergen|Kenneth Gergen]] brought out the [[social constructionism]] approach which claims that individuals were psychologically composed by the social connections they have with others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An invitation to social construction|last=Gergen, Kenneth J.|isbn=978-1-84920-788-1|edition=Third|location=Los Angeles, California|oclc=907881498|date = 19 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, although learning can happen individually, it can only be evaluated in a social context. [[Jean Lave]] and [[\u00c9tienne Wenger]], through their book ''Situated Learning'', claimed that learning occurs in certain situations and that the environmental context influences the learning outcomes too.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Situated learning : legitimate peripheral participation|last=Lave, Jean.|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wenger, Etienne, 1952-|isbn=0-521-41308-7|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=23287084}}</ref>\n\nOther learning psychological learning theories were developed during the 1980s and beyond. [[Experiential learning]], modeled by [[David Kolb]], is a learning theory that describe learning as an iterative process of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Experiential learning : experience as the source of learning and development|last=Kolb, David A., 1939-|isbn=978-0-13-389240-6|edition=Second|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|oclc=909815841|year = 2015}}</ref> [[Robert Kegan]] created a constructive-developmental approach which expands upon Piaget's stages of child development into a lifelong process which includes adulthood.<ref name=\":0\" /> Also, in 1991, the American psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] wrote ''The Unschooled Mind'' which focused on three different types of learning: intuitive learning, school learning, and expert learning. Intuitive learning is the most natural which occurs most in the preschool years; school learning is the learning forced upon children during the school years, and the intuitive-expert learning is the type of learning Gardner argues everyone should strive towards.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=The unschooled mind : how children think and how schools should teach|last=Gardner, Howard, 1943-|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-02438-4|location=New York|oclc=705522857}}</ref>\n\n== Psychologists and learning theorists ==\nThis section is a list of [[psychologist]]s whose findings and theories are important to the development of the Psychology of Learning. Each of their contributions furthered our knowledge of this new and noteworthy [[theoretical science]].\n\n===Socrates===\n[[Socrates]] (469-399 B.C.) introduced a method of learning known as piloting, through which one arrives at one's own answers through power of reasoning. Socrates, in dialogue with Meno, taught this method, by teaching a slave boy, who knew nothing about the Euclidean geometry, the Pythagorean theorem. He did so by asking questions or rephrasing them until the correct answer was found. Socrates strongly influenced the idea that knowledge is innate and can be found from within, it is also known as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]].<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Meno|last=Plato|publisher=80e, Grube translation|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Hermann Ebbinghaus===\n[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20141909) examined learning, by studying rote memory and forgetting. With himself as his own experimental subject, he used meaningless syllables form lists that read several times until he could restated them with high accuracy. Additionally, he attempted to recall the same lists with certain delay (e.g., a few days or months later) and then recorded his discoveries as [[learning curve]]s and the [[forgetting curve]]s.<ref name=hist/>\n\n===Edward Thorndike===\n[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) presented his theory of the \"Law of Effect\" in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology|last=Myers|first=David G.|last2=Dewall|first2=C. Nathan|publisher=Worth publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4641-4081-5|location=New York, NY|pages=290}}</ref> According to this theory, humans and other animals learn behaviors through trial-and-error methods. Once a functioning solution is found, these behaviors are likely to be repeated during the same or similar task.<ref name=thorndike/> It was his work on learning theory that resulted in [[operant conditioning]] within behaviorism. His theory of operant conditioning is learning from the consequences of our actions and behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/edward-thorndike.html|title=Edward Thorndike - Law of Effect {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===Ivan Pavlov===\n[[Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) was a Russian physiologist, who contributed to research on learning. Knowing that a hungry dog salivates when food is present, he performed a series of experiments and trained dogs to salivate through an arbitrary external stimuli. This was done by pairing natural stimuli (such as food) with a new stimulus (e.g., a metronome) to provoke the desired response in dogs. That proved his thesis that he could make a dog salivate by just the presentation of the sound of a bell. Pavlov's approach to learning was behavioristic and later known as [[classical conditioning]].[[Psychology of learning#cite note-9|<sup>[9]</sup>]]\n\n=== John Broadus Watson ===\n[[John Broadus Watson]] (1878\u20131958) also used this method of learning (e.g., he caused a young child, not previously afraid of furry animals, to become frightened of them) and argued that it was sufficient for the science of psychology, specifically [[behaviorism]].<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the History of Psychology|last=Hergenhahn|first=B. R.|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=978-0-495-50621-8|location=Belmont, CA|pages=403\u2013412}}</ref> Watson is often referred to as being the founder of the school of behaviorism. From 1920-1960, this school influenced a great deal of North American psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/intro.htm|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Introduction to Watson (1913) by C.D. Green|last=Green|first=Christopher D.|website=psychclassics.yorku.ca|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===Burrhus F. Skinner===\n[[Burrhus F. Skinner]] (1904-1990) developed [[operant conditioning]], in which specific behaviors resulted from stimuli, which caused them to appear more or less frequently.<ref name=hist/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology|last=Myers|first=David G.|last2=Dewall|first2=C. Nathan|publisher=Worth publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4641-4081-5|location=New York, NY|pages=290\u2013299}}</ref> By the 1920s, John B. Watson's ideas had become popular and influential in the world of psychology and classical conditioning was being explored by other behaviorists. Skinner's was one of these behaviorists. He thought that in order to understand behavior we needed to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this operant conditioning. Skinner is referred to as the father of operant conditioning but his theory stems from the works presented by Edward Thorndike.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html|title=B.F. Skinner {{!}} Operant Conditioning {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===Jean Piaget===\n[[Jean Piaget]] is known for his theory of cognitive development that describes how children create a mental model of the world around them. His theory is important because it is one of the first theories that disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a steadfast trait. His theory sees cognitive development as something that happens because of biological maturation and one's interaction with their surrounding environment. Piaget did not want to measure a child's knowledge, like an [[Intelligence quotient|I.Q]]. score, instead he focused on how children did with fundamental concepts. Piaget's theory has four stages. The [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor stage|sensorimotor]] stage which is birth to 18\u201324 months. The [[preoperational]] stage is toddler ages (18\u201324 months) to early childhood, age 7. The [[Concrete Operational|concrete operational]] stage, ages 7 to 12. Then the [[Formal Operational|formal operation]] stage which is adolescence to adulthood. Before Piaget's theory it was believed that children were just less competent thinkers but this theory and his stages helped to show that children think in significantly differently ways than adults do''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|title=Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>\n\n===Lev Vygotsky===\n[[Lev Vygotsky]] is best known for his theory in cognitive development known as [[social development theory]]. Vygotsky was developing his theories of [[cognitive development]] around the same time that Jean Piaget was developing his theories. Vygotsky believed that social interaction plays a critical role in cognitive development. He places a large emphasis on culture and how it affects cognitive development. He also sees the importance of adults in cognitive development in children. Vygotsky says that development cannot be understood without referring back to the social and also the cultural context in which it is embedded. Vygotsky claimed that learning occurs via skillful interaction in which the child is with someone who models behaviors or gives instructions for the child to follow, most likely a parent or a teacher. The child tries to understand the instructions or actions provided and then stores the information so they can use it to guide their future performances. Piaget's theory says that a child's development must follow their learning, Vygotsky disagreed with this. He believed that social learning tends to come before development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|title=Vygotsky {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Psychology of learning theories ==\n[[Learning theory (education)|Learning theories]] are attempts to better understand and explain learning processes. There are several different theories that account for learning.\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe neuroscience of learning focuses on the relationships among the central nervous system, learning, and behavior.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> This central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord which are responsible for controlling behavior. This differs from the autonomic nervous system which relates with more autonomous functions such as respiration and digestion. Within the CNS, there are neurons, which send messages within and from the brain to the rest of body through electrical and chemical signals. The CNS also has glial cells which assist neurons in the communication process.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience : exploring the brain|last=Bear, Mark F.|others=Connors, Barry W.,, Paradiso, Michael A.|isbn=978-0-7817-7817-6|edition=Fourth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=897825779|year = 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience|others=Purves, Dale|isbn=978-1-60535-380-7|edition=Sixth|location=New York|oclc=990257568|date = 4 July 2018}}</ref> These neurons communicate and form connections, also called consolidation, to form a person's cognition. Hence, learning, from a neuroscience perspective, focuses on how the organization of this neural network changes through the use and reception of information.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNeuroscience has an explanation for the acquisition of memory. In the brain, there are two types of memory called working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM).<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> WM is memory of immediate thoughts; it is a memory that collects, organizes, and retains sensory information for a short time. Information in WM needs to be repeated in order to be retained. LTM, also called permanent memory, is memory that is retained for the long-term. Hence, a concept is considered \"learned\" when information from WM enters and gets stored into LTM.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nNeuroscience also plays a role in related areas such as motivation and self-regulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivation : biological, psychological, and environmental|last=Deckers, Lambert.|isbn=978-0-205-94100-1|edition=Fourth|location=Boston|oclc=841559013|date = 10 July 2013}}</ref> Motivation, a psychological component related to learning, also has an explanation through neuroscience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miendlarzewska|first=Ewa A.|last2=Bavelier|first2=Daphne|last3=Schwartz|first3=Sophie|date=2016|title=Influence of reward motivation on human declarative memory|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=61|pages=156\u2013176|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.11.015|pmid=26657967|doi-access=free}}</ref> Overall, the brain has a disposition towards rewards and outcomes related to pleasure. In fact, it bring out certain chemical and opiates that give a natural high increasing a person's motivation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Self-regulation, which plays a significant factor into learning, are also represented by the brain's synaptic connections. These particular connections between self-regulatory activities and tasks help people to regulate their learning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Behaviorism ===\n[[Behaviorism]] views knowledge as a collection of behavioral responses towards different stimuli in the environment. In behaviorism, learning is promoted by positive reinforcement and reiteration. Throughout the history of psychology, there have been many different behaviorist learning theories. All these theories relate stimulus with response such that a person or animal learns and changes its behavior based upon the stimulus it receives. One significant theory proposed by B.F, Skinner is operant conditioning.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R.|last2=Cerutti|first2=D. T.|date=2003|title=Operant Conditioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115\u2013144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|issn=0066-4308|pmc=1473025|pmid=12415075}}</ref> This theory claims that the consequences from behaviors will determine future behavior. Consequences to behavior that are positive, and therefore reinforcing, will increase the corresponding behavior. However, consequences that are punishing will decrease behavior.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn a behaviorist perspective, motivation is due to the consequences of behavior and hence completely external. If a consequence is positive, that will further increase one's motivation and eventually one's behavior. On the other hand, if a consequence is negative, one's motivation and behavior will decrease. Behaviorism exists in many current models for learning such as rewards and consequences in classrooms and other incentives like having content mastery goals.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, it does not account for all aspects of learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> Memory, for instance, is not addressed as behaviorism does not consider internal processes. Nevertheless, learning surrounding behaviorism is still very prevalent today.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Social cognitive theory ===\nSocial cognitive theory proposes that much of human learning occurs through the social environment.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Many ideas surrounding social cognitive theory were proposed by Albert Bandura, a clinical psychologist. Unlike behaviorism, which argues that learning is caused through the reinforcement of actions and routines, social cognitive theory provides a cognitive component for learning.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bandura|first=Albert|chapter=Social Cognitive Theory of Social Referencing|date=1992|pages=175\u2013208|editor-last=Feinman|editor-first=Saul|publisher=Springer US|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2462-9_8|isbn=978-1-4899-2464-3|title=Social Referencing and the Social Construction of Reality in Infancy}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Social learning theory|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1977|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-816751-6|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=|oclc=2635133}}</ref> For instance, learning can occur purely through observation, where a person can gain knowledge of a concept or acquire an understanding of a rule, attitude, beliefs, without actually acting out any of these respective ideas.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModels also play a significant great role in learning according to social cognitive theory. For instance, a person can gain useful knowledge and understanding through information gained from the model. However, solely observing models does not guarantee one will master the concepts represented in the model. Instead, these models provide information about possible outcomes and inform how the observer should act.<ref name=\":8\" /> Hence, while learning can occur without actually partaking in any enactive learning (learning by doing), the social cognitive theory learning is most effective when it is done enactively and vicariously (learning through observation).<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nSocial cognitive theory describes human behavior as agentic meaning that humans have intentions and agendas that drive their behavior. This perspective explains lot of human learning behavior such as setting goals and regulating one's thoughts, emotions, and behavior for the purpose of learning.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Information processing theories ===\nInformation processing theories focus on the ways information is collected, analyzed, and stored in the human brain.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Tangen|first=Jodi L.|last2=Borders|first2=L.

Also called the dual memory model, the two-store memory model describes learning as storing information and knowledge from one's environment into one's short-term memory (STM) and eventually into one's long-term memory (LTM).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memory and aging : current issues and future directions|date=2012|publisher=Psychology Press|others=Naveh-Benjamin, Moshe., Ohta, Nobuo.|isbn=978-1-136-58302-5|location=New York|oclc=795124261}}</ref> To elaborate, information about your environment is collected through your senses.

For instance, some argue that that there is one type of memory in the brain which has different levels of processing within it. Nevertheless, the classical model poses memory as dual memory (short-term and long-term) model.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother related theory is the dual-code theory which splits the brain processes into two systems: an imaginal system and a verbal system. The imaginal system primarily stores concrete events and objects while the verbal system stores more abstract information from language. This theory also allows for knowledge transfer within both systems as images, expressed through verbal language, can be encoded and placed into the imaginal system.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Kousta|first=Stavroula-Thaleia|last2=Vigliocco|first2=Gabriella|last3=Vinson|first3=David P.|last4=Andrews|first4=Mark|last5=Del Campo|first5=Elena|date=2011|title=The representation of abstract words: Why emotion matters.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=140|issue=1|pages=14\u201334|doi=10.1037/a0021446|pmid=21171803|issn=1939-2222}}</ref>\n\nWhile these theories can be traced back to gestalt psychology, much of the these theories were influenced by the rise of technology, neuroscience, and communications.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Constructivism ===\nConstructivism is a philosophical perspective which argues that much of what one learns and understands about the world is constructed.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=Constructivism : theory, perspectives, and practice|date=2005|publisher=Teachers College Press|others=Fosnot, Catherine Twomey.|isbn=0-8077-4570-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=57040003}}</ref> Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cognitive constructivism ====\n[[Cognitive constructivism]], stemming from Jean Piaget's theories, sees learning as adding new information to cognitive structures that are already there. Piaget's theory claim that people cognitively develop by passing through several stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Piaget's theory of cognitive and affective development|last=Wadsworth, Barry J.|date=2004|publisher=Pearson/A and B|isbn=0-205-40603-3|edition=Classic ed., 5th|location=Boston|oclc=53807097}}</ref>\n\nThe sensorimotor stage, which occurs from birth to around age 2, is when children act spontaneously to make sense of their world. Much of these actions are sensory in nature (e.g. touching) and rooted in present action. The preoperational stage occurs between ages 2 to 7 and is categorized by children being able to reflect briefly on the past and imagine the future.<ref name=\":12\" /> However, in the preoperational stage, most of one's thinking in this stage is still grounded in one's experiences in the present. The concrete operational stage, which occurs between ages 7 to 11, is when children rapidly grow cognitively and drastically improve their basic skills and language. Here, children can demonstrate some abstract thinking although much of this thinking is still grounded by actions.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> The formal operational stage, which starts around age 11 and goes on to adulthood, is the last developmental stage in Piaget's theory. This stage expands upon the concrete operational stage by using higher levels of thinking such as hypothetical thinking, more developed abstract thinking, and idealistic thinking.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nThroughout these motivational stages, the mechanism in which the children and people learn, is through a concept called equilibrium. This mechanism is the process where an individual is able to resolve cognitive conflicts by either applying one's beliefs to one's experiences (a process called assimilation) or by changing one's beliefs to accommodate new experiences and information when encountering new situations or concepts.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Social constructivism ====\n[[Social constructivism]], like its name suggests, believes that knowledge and learning is gained within social situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gsi.berkeley.edu/gsi-guide-contents/learning-theory-research/learning-overview/|title=Overview of Learning Theories {{!}} GSI Teaching & Resource Center|website=gsi.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Lead by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, social constructivism has a more sociocultural approach. This approach argues that the social environment facilitates learning through certain tools such objects, language, and organizations. Through these tools, cognitive learning occurs when the people interact with these tools socially and internalize them.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Vygotsky for educators|last=Karpov, Yuriy V., 1957-|isbn=978-1-107-06542-0|location=New York, NY|oclc=871343716|date = 9 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nA major concept within social constructivism is the zone of proximal development (ZPD). ZPD represents the potential amount of learning a student can have given the right environmental conditions. This model suggests that the teacher and student work together to further the student's learning. Educational examples of this include instructional scaffolding and apprenticeships where the educator takes an invested and active role in furthering the knowledge of the student.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Motivation ===\nVarious motivational theories play a role in the psychology of learning. [[John William Atkinson]]'s motivation theory argues that people are motivated to achieve their best. This motivation is in part moderated by two different sources: the desire to succeed as well as the fear of failure.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another motivational theory is [[Allan Wigfield]]'s and [[Jacquelynne Eccles]]'s expectancy-value theory which states that motivation is moderated by one's desire for success as well as the importance of the tasks one needs to do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigfield|first=Allan|last2=Eccles|first2=Jacquelynne S.|date=2000|title=Expectancy\u2013Value Theory of Achievement Motivation|journal=Contemporary Educational Psychology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=68\u201381|doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1015|pmid=10620382}}</ref> Self-worth theory also plays a role in learning as students and individuals are motivated to learn and achieve because of their desire to maintain their perception of being high achieving.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Goal theory]] is another related theory. Learners usually have two types of goals: learning mastery goals (e.g. learning a new concept) and performance goals (e.g. being first place). This theory suggests that mastery goals are more effective than performance goals as a motivator. This is because performance goals may cause people to do more social comparison, such as comparing oneself to others, which may ineffectively raise motivation.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Mindsets related to learning also play into motivation. Psychologist [[Carol Dweck]] distinguished differences between the growth mindset, the idea that ability is malleable, and the fixed mindset, the idea that ability is fixed. People who incorporate a growth mindset on a certain task tend to have higher motivation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mindset : the new psychology of success|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|date=2006|publisher=Random House|isbn=1-4000-6275-6|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=|oclc=58546262|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mindsetnewpsycho00dwec}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of competence and motivation : theory and application|others=Elliot, Andrew J.,, Dweck, Carol S., 1946-, Yeager, David S.|isbn=978-1-4625-2960-5|edition=Second|location=New York|oclc=961457526|date = 28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Attribution theory]], which discusses how people perceive and attribute a certain behavior or outcome to a certain characteristic, also relates to motivation and learning. According to [[Bernie Weiner]]'s attribution model, students attribute their academic achievement based on effort, ability, and luck. The way an individual attributes his or her academic performance will determine that person's level of motivation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTheories related to control also have a major impact to learning. When people begin to perceive that their performance outcomes are not related to their own effort, this can severely limit motivation. At the most extreme, this can lead to learned helplessness which is when a person is experiencing a negative cycle where one's negative beliefs interactions with one's academic failures and motivation.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maier|first=Steven F.|last2=Seligman|first2=Martin E. P.|date=2016|title=Learned helplessness at fifty: Insights from neuroscience.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=123|issue=4|pages=349\u2013367|doi=10.1037/rev0000033|issn=1939-1471|pmc=4920136|pmid=27337390}}</ref>\n\nVarious types of motivation also play a role particularly intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. [[Intrinsic motivation]] is an inherent type of motivation that one engages as an end to itself. [[Extrinsic motivation]], on the other hand, is a motivation that is provided externally such as external awards or punishments. Research has shown that incentives which reward task engagement lowers intrinsic motivation as it is much like controlling behavior. However, rewards related to one's performance are more effective which can help further one's skill, motivation, and self-efficacy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intrinsic motivation|last=Deci, Edward L.|date=1975|publisher=Plenum Press|isbn=0-306-34401-7|location=New York|pages=|oclc=1500344|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intrinsicmotivat00deci}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Educational Psychology]]\n* [[Learning]]\n* [[Media psychology]]\n* [[Learning theory (education)]]\n* [[Classical conditioning]]\n* [[Operant conditioning]]\n\n==References==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=psychology of learning}}\n\n{{reflist | refs=\n<ref name=hist><Marton, Ference, and Shirley Booth.

This is especially so when the music is a classical or other well-known piece. In such cases, the music for the animation is pre-recorded, and an animator will have an [[exposure sheet]] with the beats marked on it, [[film frame|frame]] by frame, and can time the movements accordingly. In the 1940 film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', the musical piece ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', composed in the 1890s, contains a fragment that is used to accompany the actions of Mickey himself. At one point Mickey, as the apprentice, seizes an axe and chops an enchanted broom to pieces so that it will stop carrying water to a pit. The visual action is synchronized exactly to crashing chords in the music.\n\n==Examples==\nThe first known use of Mickey Mousing was in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928), the first Mickey Mouse cartoon by Walt Disney, scored by [[Carl Stalling]].<ref name=\"Wegele\"/> In the 1931 [[Van Beuren Studios]] animated short ''Making 'Em Move'' the \"Mysterioso Pizzicato\" theme is Mickey Moused to the action first to produce a \"false sense of foreboding\" as a curious visitor enters the animation factory, and then again to accompany the villain in a cartoon-within-a-cartoon.<ref name=Goldmark>Goldmark, D.

This is especially so when the music is a classical or other well-known piece. In such cases, the music for the animation is pre-recorded, and an animator will have an [[exposure sheet]] with the beats marked on it, [[film frame|frame]] by frame, and can time the movements accordingly. In the 1940 film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', the musical piece ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', composed in the 1890s, contains a fragment that is used to accompany the actions of Mickey himself. At one point Mickey, as the apprentice, seizes an axe and chops an enchanted broom to pieces so that it will stop carrying water to a pit. The visual action is synchronized exactly to crashing chords in the music.\n\n==Examples==\nThe first known use of Mickey Mousing was in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928), the first Mickey Mouse cartoon by Walt Disney, scored by [[Carl Stalling]].<ref name=\"Wegele\"/> In the 1931 [[Van Beuren Studios]] animated short ''Making 'Em Move'' the \"Mysterioso Pizzicato\" theme is Mickey Moused to the action first to produce a \"false sense of foreboding\" as a curious visitor enters the animation factory, and then again to accompany the villain in a cartoon-within-a-cartoon.<ref name=Goldmark>Goldmark, D.

In [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (1993 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1993), Mickey Mousing is used at the opening, with the visual slowed to match the music, producing an intentional lightly comical effect.<ref>Stevens (2009), p.95.</ref>\n\nIn [[video game]]s, Mickey Mousing may occur in dynamic audio compositions, such as in reaction or for indication (for example, in response to character action or to alert the player to the end of a countdown), and is often found in [[platform game]]s.<ref name=\"Rauscher98\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\nThe term \"Mickey Mousing\" is also used as a pejorative to imply that a technique used in productions aimed at adults is too simplistic and more appropriate for a juvenile audience.<ref name=\"Helvering\"/> The technique is also associated with [[melodrama]].<ref name=\"Helvering\"/> The technique is criticized for visual action that is \u2013 without good reason \u2013 being duplicated in accompanying music or text, therefore being a weakness of the production rather than a strength. Newlin lists six other functions which music may serve besides this one.<ref name=\"Newlin\"/> Complaints regarding the technique may be found as early as 1946, when [[Chuck Jones]] complained that, \"For some reason, many cartoon musicians are more concerned with exact synchronization or 'Mickey-Mousing' than with the originality of their contribution or the variety of their arrangement.\"<ref>Chuck Jones. \"Music and the Animated Cartoon\", p.365, ''Hollywood Quarterly'' Problems of Communication: The Animated Cartoon, Vol. 1, No. 4.

Quoted in Helvering (July 2007), p.177.</ref> In 1954 [[Jean Cocteau]] described Mickey Mousing as the most vulgar technique used in film music.<ref name=\"Wegele\"/> In 1958 [[Hanns Eisler]] described Mickey Mousing as, \"This awful Wagnerian illustration technique! When they speak about a dog, someone in the orchestra barks...for love we have the divisi violins in E major...This is unbearable.\"<ref name=\"Wegele\"/>\n\n\"It is interesting that Mickey Mousing has come to represent the worst excesses of the Hollywood film score. Perhaps as contemporary spectators we are no longer used to Mickey Mousing in films (its use radically diminished in the fifties and after). Still, the practice of catching every moment with music has a visual equivalent, and Mickey Mousing has been made to bear the brunt of the criticism for an overobnoxiousness that it only partially creates.\"<ref>Kalinak, Kathryn (1992).
