Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.

Inspired by UK bands such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-[[NATO]]. Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.

The book by Gower, Lubbe and le Roux (2011) aims to popularize biplots as a useful and reliable method for the visualization of multivariate data when researchers want to consider, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), canonical variates analysis (CVA) or various types of correspondence analysis.\n\n==Construction==\nA biplot is constructed by using the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to obtain a [[low-rank approximation]] to a transformed version of the data matrix '''X''', whose ''n'' rows are the samples (also called the cases, or objects), and whose ''p'' columns are the variables. The transformed data matrix '''Y''' is obtained from the original matrix '''X''' by centering and optionally standardizing the columns (the variables). Using the SVD, we can write '''Y'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2211<sub>''k''=1,...''p''</sub>''d''<sub>''k''</sub>'''u'''<sub>''k''</sub>'''v'''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>T</sup>;, where the '''u'''<sub>''k''</sub> are ''n''-dimensional column vectors, the '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub> are ''p''-dimensional column vectors, and the ''d''<sub>''k''</sub> are a non-increasing sequence of non-negative [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]. The biplot is formed from two scatterplots that share a common set of axes and have a between-set [[scalar product]] interpretation. The first scatterplot is formed from the points (''d''<sub>1</sub><sup>\u03b1</sup>''u''<sub>1''i''</sub>, &nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub><sup>\u03b1</sup>''u''<sub>2''i''</sub>), for ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,...,''n''.  The second plot is formed from the points (''d''<sub>1</sub><sup>1\u2212\u03b1</sup>''v''<sub>1''j''</sub>,&nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub><sup>1\u2212\u03b1</sup>''v''<sub>2''j''</sub>), for ''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,...,''p''.  This is the biplot formed by the dominant two terms of the SVD, which can then be represented in a two-dimensional display.  Typical choices of \u03b1 are 1 (to give a distance interpretation to the row display) and 0 (to give a distance interpretation to the column display), and in some rare cases \u03b1=1/2 to obtain a symmetrically scaled biplot (which gives no distance interpretation to the rows or the columns, but only the scalar product interpretation).  The set of points depicting the variables can be drawn as arrows from the origin to reinforce the idea that they represent biplot axes onto which the samples can be projected to approximate the original data.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1093/biomet/58.3.453|last=Gabriel|first=K.R.|authorlink=K.

If the modules have additional structure, like [[topology|topologies]] or [[Bornological space|bornologies]], then one can study the subspace of linear maps that preserve this structure.\n\n==Topologies of uniform convergence==\n\nSuppose that ''T'' is any set and that <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is a collection of subsets of ''T'' directed by inclusion. Suppose in addition that ''Y'' is a [[topological vector space]] (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) and that <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> is a basis of neighborhoods of 0 in ''Y''. Then the set of all functions from ''T'' into ''Y'', <math>Y^T</math>, can be given a unique translation-invariant topology by defining a basis of neighborhoods of 0 in <math>Y^T</math>, to be\n:<math>\\mathcal{U}(G, N) = \\{f \\in Y^T : f(G) \\subseteq N\\}</math>\nas ''G'' and ''N'' range over all <math>G \\in \\mathcal{G}</math> and <math>N \\in \\mathcal{N}</math>. This topology does not depend on the basis  <math>\\mathcal{N}</math> that was chosen and it is known as the '''topology of uniform convergence on the sets in <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>''' or as the '''<math>\\mathcal{G}</math>-topology'''.<ref name=\"Schaefer (1970) p. 79\">Schaefer (1970) p. 79</ref> In practice, <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> usually consists of a collection of sets with certain properties and this name is changed appropriately to reflect this set so that if, for instance, <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is the collection of compact subsets of ''T'' (and ''T'' is a topological space), then this topology is called the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subsets of ''T''. A subset <math>\\mathcal{G}_1</math> of <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is said to be '''fundamental with respect to <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>''' if each <math>G \\in \\mathcal{G}</math> is a subset of some element in <math>\\mathcal{G}_1</math>. In this case, the collection <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> can be replaced by <math>\\mathcal{G}_1</math> without changing the topology on <math>Y^T</math>.<ref name=\"Schaefer (1970) p. 79\" />\n\nHowever, the <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>-topology on <math>Y^T</math> is not necessarily compatible with the vector space structure of <math>Y^T</math> or of any of its vector subspaces (that is, it is not necessarily a topological vector space topology on <math>Y^T</math>). Suppose that ''F'' is a vector subspace of <math>Y^T</math> so that it inherits the subspace topology from <math>Y^T</math>.

If the topological space ''T'' is also a topological vector space, then the condition that <math>\\bigcup_{G \\in \\mathcal{G}} G</math> be dense in ''T'' can be replaced by the weaker condition that the linear span of this set be dense in ''T'', in which case we say that this set is '''total in ''T'''''.<ref name=\"Schaefer (1970) p. 80\">Schaefer (1970) p. 80</ref>\n* ''Boundedness'': Let ''H'' be a subset of <math>Y^T</math>.

In an analogous way to how we placed a topology on ''L(X, Y)'' we can place a topology on <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> and <math>B(X, Y; Z)</math>.\n\nLet <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> be a set of subsets of ''X'', <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> be a set of subsets of ''Y''. Let <math>\\mathcal{G} \\times \\mathcal{H}</math> denote the collection of all sets ''G'' \u00d7 ''H'' where <math>G \\in \\mathcal{G}</math>, <math>H \\in \\mathcal{H}</math>. We can place on <math>Z^{X \\times Y}</math> the <math>\\mathcal{G} \\times \\mathcal{H}</math>-topology, and consequently on any of its subsets, in particular on <math>B(X, Y; Z)</math> and on <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math>. This topology is known as the '''<math>\\mathcal{G}-\\mathcal{H}</math>-topology''' or as the '''topology of uniform convergence on the products <math>G \\times H</math> of <math>\\mathcal{G} \\times \\mathcal{H}</math>'''.\n\nHowever, as before, this topology is not necessarily compatible with the vector space structure of <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> or of <math>B(X, Y; Z)</math> without the additional requirement that for all bilinear maps, <math>b</math> in this space (that is, in <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> or in <math>B(X, Y; Z)</math>) and for all <math>G \\in \\mathcal{G}</math> and <math>H \\in \\mathcal{H}</math> the set <math>b(G, H)</math> is bounded in ''X''. If both <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> consist of bounded sets then this requirement is automatically satisfied if we are topologizing <math>B(X, Y; Z)</math> but this may not be the case if we are trying to topologize <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math>. The <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>-<math>\\mathcal{H}</math>-topology on <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> will be compatible with the vector space structure of <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> if both <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> consists of bounded sets and any of the following conditions hold:\n* ''X'' and ''Y'' are barrelled spaces and <math>Z</math> is locally convex.\n* ''X'' is a [[F-space]], ''Y'' is metrizable, and <math>Z</math> is Hausdorff, in which case <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z) = B(X, Y; Z)</math>,.\n* <math>X, Y</math>, and <math>Z</math> are the strong duals of reflexive Fr\u00e9chet spaces.\n* ''X'' is normed and ''Y'' and <math>Z</math> the strong duals of reflexive Fr\u00e9chet spaces.\n\n===The ''\u03b5''-topology===\n\nSuppose that <math>X, Y</math>, and <math>Z</math> are locally convex spaces and let <math>\\mathcal{G}</math>' and <math>\\mathcal{H}</math>' be the collections of equicontinuous subsets of <math>X^*</math> and <math>Y^*</math>, respectively.

Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force, whereas in the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of commercial confidentiality to protect [[shareholder]] value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.\n\n===Corporate crime===\n{{Main|Corporate crime}}\nCorporate crime deals with the company as a whole. The crime benefits the investors or the individuals who are in high positions in the company or corporation. White-collar crime and corporate crime are similar because they take place within the business world. The difference is that white-collar crime benefits the individual(s) involved, and corporate crime benefits the company or the corporation, usually high-ranking individuals within the corporation.<ref>Monday, On behalf of Darryl A.

Although law enforcement claims to have prioritized white-collar crime,<ref>{{cite news |last=Anzalone|first=Charles|title=White-Collar Crime Has Become Priority of Law Enforcement|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=28 April 1991}}</ref> evidence shows that it continues to be a low priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/states-white-collar-convicts-get-lighter-sentences-9311|title=State's white collar convicts get lighter sentences|work=California Watch}}</ref>\n\nWhen senior levels of a corporation engage in criminal activity using the company this is sometimes called [[control fraud]].\n\n===Organized transnational crime===\nOrganized [[Transnational crime|transnational crime]] is organized criminal activity that takes place across national jurisdictions, and with advances in transportation and information technology, law enforcement officials and policymakers have needed to respond to this form of crime on a global scale. Some examples include [[human trafficking]], [[Money laundering|money laundering]], [[Drug smuggling|drug smuggling]], illegal arms dealing, [[terrorism]], and [[cybercrime]]. Although it is impossible to precisely gauge transnational crime, the [[The Millennium Project|Millennium Project]], an international think tank, assembled statistics on several aspects of transnational crime in 2009:<ref name=\"o'grady\" />\n*World illicit trade of almost $780 billion\n*Counterfeiting and piracy of $300 billion to $1 trillion\n*Global drug trade of $321 billion \n\n===Occupational crime===\nIndividuals may commit crime during employment or unemployment. The two most common forms are [[theft]] and [[fraud]]. Theft can be of varying degrees, from a pencil to furnishings to a car. [[Insider trading]], the trading of stock by someone with access to publicly unavailable information, is a type of fraud.<ref name=\"o'grady\" />\n\n===Crimes related to national interests===\nThe crimes related to the national interests consist mainly of treason.  In the modern world, there are a lot of nations which divide the crimes into some laws. \"Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression\" is the crime of communicating with [[alien (law)|aliens]] secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. \"Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression\" is the treason of co-operating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" is the internal treason. Depending on a country, criminal conspiracy is added to these. One example is [[Jho Low]], a mega thief and traitor who stole billions in USA currency from a [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|Malaysian government fund]] and is now on a run as a fugitive. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Sukumaran |first1=Tashny |title=What's the deal with Jho Low, Malaysia's most wanted man? |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2171428/whats-deal-jho-low-malaysias-most-wanted-man |accessdate=25 February 2019 |agency=South China Morning Post |publisher=South China Morning Post Publishers |date=16 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to a 2016 study,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kimberly D.|last2=Klenowski|first2=Paul M.|date=2016-05-01|title=Who Commits White-Collar Crime, and What Do We Know About Them?|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199925513-e-6|journal=The Oxford Handbook of White-Collar Crime|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.013.6|editor1-last=Van Slyke|editor1-first=Shanna R|editor2-last=Benson|editor2-first=Michael L|editor3-last=Cullen|editor3-first=Francis T}}</ref> <blockquote>A considerable percentage of white-collar offenders are gainfully employed middle-aged Caucasian men who usually commit their first whitecollar offense sometime between their late thirties through their mid-forties and appear to have middle-class backgrounds. Most have some higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. Whitecollar offenders usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality, but many do not overindulge in vice. Recent research examining the five-factor personality trait model determined that white-collar offenders tend to be more neurotic and less agreeable and conscientious than their non-criminal counterparts.</blockquote>\n\n==Punishment==\nIn the United States, sentences for white-collar crimes may include a combination of [[imprisonment]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[restitution]], [[Community service#Alternative sentencing|community service]], [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]], [[probation]], or other alternative punishment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rubino, Esq.

Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force, whereas in the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of commercial confidentiality to protect [[shareholder]] value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.\n\n===Corporate crime===\n{{Main|Corporate crime}}\nCorporate crime deals with the company as a whole. The crime benefits the investors or the individuals who are in high positions in the company or corporation. White-collar crime and corporate crime are similar because they take place within the business world.

Some examples include [[human trafficking]], [[Money laundering|money laundering]], [[Drug smuggling|drug smuggling]], illegal arms dealing, [[terrorism]], and [[cybercrime]]. Although it is impossible to precisely gauge transnational crime, the [[The Millennium Project|Millennium Project]], an international think tank, assembled statistics on several aspects of transnational crime in 2009:<ref name=\"o'grady\" />\n*World illicit trade of almost $780 billion\n*Counterfeiting and piracy of $300 billion to $1 trillion\n*Global drug trade of $321 billion \n\n===Occupational crime===\nIndividuals may commit crime during employment or unemployment. The two most common forms are [[theft]] and [[fraud]]. Theft can be of varying degrees, from a pencil to furnishings to a car. [[Insider trading]], the trading of stock by someone with access to publicly unavailable information, is a type of fraud.<ref name=\"o'grady\" />\n\n===Crimes related to national interests===\nThe crimes related to the national interests consist mainly of treason.  In the modern world, there are a lot of nations which divide the crimes into some laws. \"Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression\" is the crime of communicating with [[alien (law)|aliens]] secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. \"Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression\" is the treason of co-operating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" is the internal treason. Depending on a country, criminal conspiracy is added to these. One example is [[Jho Low]], a mega thief and traitor who stole billions in USA currency from a [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|Malaysian government fund]] and is now on a run as a fugitive. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Sukumaran |first1=Tashny |title=What's the deal with Jho Low, Malaysia's most wanted man? |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2171428/whats-deal-jho-low-malaysias-most-wanted-man |accessdate=25 February 2019 |agency=South China Morning Post |publisher=South China Morning Post Publishers |date=16 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to a 2016 study,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kimberly D.|last2=Klenowski|first2=Paul M.|date=2016-05-01|title=Who Commits White-Collar Crime, and What Do We Know About Them?|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199925513-e-6|journal=The Oxford Handbook of White-Collar Crime|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199925513.013.6|editor1-last=Van Slyke|editor1-first=Shanna R|editor2-last=Benson|editor2-first=Michael L|editor3-last=Cullen|editor3-first=Francis T}}</ref> <blockquote>A considerable percentage of white-collar offenders are gainfully employed middle-aged Caucasian men who usually commit their first whitecollar offense sometime between their late thirties through their mid-forties and appear to have middle-class backgrounds. Most have some higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. Whitecollar offenders usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality, but many do not overindulge in vice. Recent research examining the five-factor personality trait model determined that white-collar offenders tend to be more neurotic and less agreeable and conscientious than their non-criminal counterparts.</blockquote>\n\n==Punishment==\nIn the United States, sentences for white-collar crimes may include a combination of [[imprisonment]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[restitution]], [[Community service#Alternative sentencing|community service]], [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]], [[probation]], or other alternative punishment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rubino, Esq.
