While commonly inhabiting lowlands, it has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Occasionally it also occurs in dense tropical areas. Their home range is widely variable, depending on the local environment; individuals have been reported as ranging over territories from {{convert|6.8|to|100|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Introduced range===\nJaguarundis have been sighted in [[Florida]] since the early 20th century. Here, the species is assumed to have been [[introduced species|introduced]], but it is not known when the introduction occurred. Their presence in Florida is attributed to a writer from [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state.\n\nNo live or dead specimens are known, but many sightings considered credible by biologists have been reported. The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks.

The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at about two years of age, and have lived for up to 10 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002. The megareserves of the [[Amazon Basin]] are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations.<ref name=iucn/>\nIt is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but is suffering decline due to loss of habitat. The [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] has expressed concern that its presence in South Texas may be imperiled due to loss of the cat's native habitat.<ref name=Texas2003>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/land/habitats/southtx_plain/endangered_species/ |title=Endangered Species |website=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=2003-04-15 |access-date=2011-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe North and Central American populations of the jaguarundi are listed in [[CITES Appendix I]].

The film stars [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Anton Diffring]]. ''Zeppelin'' depicts a fictitious German attempt to raid Great Britain in a giant [[Zeppelin]] to steal or destroy ''[[Magna Carta]]'' from its hiding place in one of Scotland's castles.\n\n==Plot==\nin 1915, during the First World War, Geoffrey Richter-Douglas (Michael York), a Scotsman of German descent, is a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]]. He meets Stephanie ([[Alexandra Stewart]]), a German spy to whom he is attracted. She suggests that he escape to Germany, where the other members of his family and his friends are. He reports this contact to his commanding officer, Captain Whitney, who also wants Geoffrey to go to Germany, but on a secret mission to steal the plans of the ''LZ36'', a new type of [[Zeppelin]] under development at [[Friedrichshafen]].\n\nGeoffrey pretends to be a deserter and travels to Germany, even getting shot in the arm by fellow British agents to sell the Germans the ruse. At Friedrichshafen, he meets his long-time friend Professor Altschul ([[Marius Goring]]), who lives with his beautiful and much younger wife, Erika ([[Elke Sommer]]), both of whom are scientists working on the new airship. Erika suspects that Geoffrey may be up to something, but keeps her suspicions to herself.\n\nGeoffrey quickly learns that German Intelligence recruited him to travel to Germany for a specific military purpose. Following a meeting with Intelligence Colonel Hirsch ([[Anton Diffring]]), he is assigned to the ''LZ36'' on its maiden test flight. As soon as it is declared airworthy, to maintain absolute secrecy without first returning to base, the airship is to take part in a military operation to steal or destroy British historical documents, including the copy of ''[[Magna Carta]]'', from Balcoven Castle in Scotland. Geoffrey is to play a key role in the mission, using his knowledge of the Scottish countryside to guide the airship very close to the castle at night while the craft is gliding with its engines off. After leaving Germany, the zeppelin lands on a lake in Norway to refuel and take on board a specially trained unit of soldiers.\n\nGeoffrey misdirects the craft's wireless operator just long enough to send a message about the LZ36's location to British intelligence. The wireless operator returns and, upon hearing the reply and realizing what Geoffrey had done, engages him in a fight. Geoffrey manages to knock him out, and then throws him out an open window, telling the captain the wireless operator had fallen while scraping ice off the airship, as many craft personnel had been ordered to do. The explanation is believed, but Geoffrey does not have a chance to send any more information because Erika comes on the scene and removes an important radio component. The airship proceeds to Balcoven Castle.\n\nUnder cover of darkness, Geoffrey navigates the airship on its final approach to the castle. A local farmer hears the sound of the airship's engines just before they are cut, and raises the alarm with the local military base, but he is not immediately believed. Geoffrey has no option but to participate in the assault, but manages to slip away to try to raise the alarm. He persuades a sceptical radio operator to contact London, but after being wounded by German soldiers, the dying operator mistakes Geoffrey for a German spy and shoots him in the arm. The Germans launch an attack on the castle, but the historical documents they seek are in vaults inaccessible to them.\n\nMeanwhile, alerted by the farmer's report and the radio operator's chaotic call, the British Admiralty scrambles several aircraft squadrons and dispatches ground troops. The British troops engage the Germans in a firefight, who withdraw empty-handed rather than risk losing the Zeppelin. The airship manages to slip away in the dark with a much depleted complement, but shortly after first light is caught by pursuing British aircraft. Several aircraft are shot down in the ensuing dogfight, but the Zeppelin is badly damaged. Despite desperately lightening the airship in an effort to stay in the air, the survivors are forced to crash-land near the coast of the neutral Netherlands. Geoffrey, Erika and the few remaining crew members make their way ashore just as the Zeppelin explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] as Geoffrey Richter-Douglas (Gottfried von Richter)\n* [[Elke Sommer]] as Erika Altschul\n* [[Peter Carsten]] as Major Tauntler\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Professor Christian Altschul\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Colonel Hirsch\n* [[Andrew Keir]] as Von Gorian, the ''LZ36'' commander\n* [[Rupert Davies]] as Captain Whitney\n* [[Alexandra Stewart]] as Stephanie\n* [[William Marlowe]] as Anderson\n* [[Richard Hurndall]] as Admiral [[Blinker Hall]], Chief of Naval Intelligence\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Michael Robbins]] as Cockney Sergeant\n* [[George Mikell]] as German Officer\n* [[Clive Morton]] as Lord Delford\n* [[Gary Waldhorn]] as Harlich\n* [[Alan Rothwell]] as Brandner\n* [[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]] as [[H.

Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.\n\nAccording to extended habitable zone concept, planetary mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth ([[super-Earth]] class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced [[albedo]], anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.\n\nFor reference, the average distance from the Sun of some major bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone are: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; align:center; background:#90b0f0;\"\n|+ Estimates of the circumstellar habitable zone boundaries of the Solar System\n!

Once the stratosphere becomes wet, water vapour photolysis releases hydrogen into space. At this point cloud feedback cooling does not increase significantly with further warming. The \"maximum greenhouse\" limit, at the outer edge, is where a {{CO2}} dominated atmosphere, of around 8 bars, has produced the maximum amount of greenhouse warming, and further increases in {{CO2}} will not create enough warming to prevent {{CO2}} catastrophically freezing out of the atmosphere.

For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun,<ref name=\"kopparapu-2013\" /> a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at <math>\\sqrt{0.25}</math>, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU.

An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above {{Earth radius|1.5|link=y}} the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.<ref>Lauren M.

Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.\n\nAccording to extended habitable zone concept, planetary mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth ([[super-Earth]] class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced [[albedo]], anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.\n\nFor reference, the average distance from the Sun of some major bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone are: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; align:center; background:#90b0f0;\"\n|+ Estimates of the circumstellar habitable zone boundaries of the Solar System\n!

Once the stratosphere becomes wet, water vapour photolysis releases hydrogen into space. At this point cloud feedback cooling does not increase significantly with further warming. The \"maximum greenhouse\" limit, at the outer edge, is where a {{CO2}} dominated atmosphere, of around 8 bars, has produced the maximum amount of greenhouse warming, and further increases in {{CO2}} will not create enough warming to prevent {{CO2}} catastrophically freezing out of the atmosphere.

For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun,<ref name=\"kopparapu-2013\" /> a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at <math>\\sqrt{0.25}</math>, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU.

An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above {{Earth radius|1.5|link=y}} the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.<ref>Lauren M.

President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told [[ABC News]] and [[Larry King]] that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of [[civil unions]] legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.\n\nBush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 [[State of the Union]] address\nand during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.\n\nBush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]], as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position |first=Christopher |last=Heredia |date=2001-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524151549/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2001%2F04%2F10%2FMN198145.DTL |url-status=dead |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}</ref> In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E.

Powell was the first [[African-American]] man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by [[Condoleezza Rice]]: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed [[Alberto Gonzales]] as the [[United States Attorney General]], the first [[Hispanic]] to hold that position.\n\nBush met with the [[National Urban League]], the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well.\n\n===Genetic Non-Discrimination===\nPresident George W.

However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from [[NASA]]'s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.\n\n[[File:BUSHOVALWTC.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

Another subject of controversy is Bush's [[Clear Skies Initiative]], which seeks to reduce [[air pollution]] through expansion of [[emissions trading]].\n\nBush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up [[pollution]] and contaminated sediment in the [[Great Lakes]], as well as the [[Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act|Brownfields Legislation]] in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or [[Brownfield land|brownfields]], to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities.\n\nBush stated his reason for not supporting the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially [[China]] and [[India]]. Bush stated, \"The world's second-largest emitter of [[greenhouse gases]] is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.\"\n\nBush also questioned the science behind the [[global warming]] phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010611-2.html|title=President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change|author=|date=|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{further|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n==== Global warming ====\n{{main|Climate change policy of the George W.

Bush administration}}\n[[File:BushCAGovs.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush speaks to firefighters on November 4, 2003, as California Governor-Elect [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Governor [[Gray Davis]] listen.]]\nAccording to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the economy suffered from a [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] that lasted from March 2001 to November 2001. During the Bush Administration, Real [[GDP]] has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title = Gross Domestic Product|publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate = 2007-07-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2-3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] have caused concern about increasing inflation.\n\nLong-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s. Under the Bush administration, productivity has grown by an average of 3.76% per year, the highest such average in ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/prod_nr.htm|title=Productivity and Costs Archived News Releases : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile the GDP recovered from a recession that some claim Bush inherited from the previous administration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7089700|title=Did Bush 'inherit' a recession?|author=|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] has since worsened according to the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]].

Although the poverty level increased the increase was still lower from 2000 to 2002 than it was from 1992 to 1997, which reached a peak of 39.3% in 1993. In 2002 the poverty rate was 34.6% which was almost equal to the rate in 1998, which was 34.5%. Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== Taxes ===\nPresident Bush won passage for two major [[tax cut]]s during his term in office: The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]]. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \"[[Bush tax cuts]]\".\n\nThe cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard [[Standard deduction|income tax deduction]] for married couples, eliminated the [[estate tax]], and reduced [[marginal tax rate]]s. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.\n\nBush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid%3D21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084200/http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=21 |archivedate=2005-12-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Bush visits NSA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

They instead allege that the purpose of the tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the tax cut, in absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national [[Economic surplus|surplus]] into a historically large [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].\n\nIn an open letter to Bush in 2004, more than 100 professors of business and economics at U.S. business schools ascribed this \"fiscal reversal\" to Bush's \"policy of slashing taxes - primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yubanet.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/13/14283|title=1,325 Kids in Nevada County Risk Summer Hunger - YubaNet - Page 14283|first=California Food Policy|last=Advocates|date=|website=www.yubanet.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, these cuts had reduced federal tax revenues, as a percentage of the [[Gross Domestic Product]], to the lowest level since 1959.

In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection \"omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year \u2014 and possibly for some time to come \u2014 for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]].\" The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts \"will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.\" If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then \"the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.\" Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.\n\nFederal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years. Non-defense spending increased 18% in that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|date=|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121046/https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|archive-date=29 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense.

[[Tariffs]] on imported [[steel]] imposed by the White House in March 2002 were lifted after the [[World Trade Organization]] ruled them illegal.

From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending \"crisis\". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax ([[FICA tax|FICA]]) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.\n\nMost Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the [[United Kingdom]]'s privatized pension plan. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]]. In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.\n\n== Capital punishment ==\nGeorge W.

The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003. As a result, the [[National Prison Rape Elimination Commission]] was created to study the problem and recommend solutions. Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding. New grants to prevent sexual assault were also created by the law. Significant support for the act came from [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Concerned Women for America]], Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2005\u201306, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of renewable sources of energy such as [[hydrogen power]], [[nuclear power]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], and [[clean coal|clean coal technologies]]. Bush proposed the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]] which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. In the 2007 State of the Union speech, President Bush proposed a 20:10 policy, where, as a nation, the United States would be working to reduce 20% of the national energy usage in next 10 years by converting to ethanol.\n\n=== Tariffs ===\nBush's imposition of a [[United States steel tariff 2002|tariff on imported steel]] and [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute|on Canadian softwood lumber]] was controversial in light of his advocacy of [[free market]] [[policies]] in other areas.

The administration has also been criticized for refusing to back various security measures relating to port security in 2003 and 2004 and vetoing all [[United States dollar|US$]]39 million for the 2002 [[Container Security Initiative]].\n\n== Diversity and civil rights ==\n=== Faith-based initiatives ===\n\nIn early 2001, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] worked with Republicans in Congress to pass [[legislation]] changing the way the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] [[regulation|regulated]], taxed and funded [[charities]] and non-profit initiatives run by [[religion|religious]] [[organizations]]. Although prior to the legislation it was possible for these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the [[White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/fbci/|title=Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|author=|date=|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations.

During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of [[gay rights]] legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a first for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm National Lesbian and Gay Task Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050611081519/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm |date=2005-06-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn his first four years of office, his views on [[gay rights]] were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401496.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays | first=Christopher | last=Lee | date=2005-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> He did not attempt to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell]], nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the [[Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007|Matthew Shepard Act]], which would have included [[sexual orientation]] in hate crimes.\n\nWhile President Bush had always been on record as opposing the [[legal]] recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on \"value issues\" such as a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told [[ABC News]] and [[Larry King]] that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of [[civil unions]] legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.\n\nBush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 [[State of the Union]] address\nand during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.\n\nBush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]], as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position |first=Christopher |last=Heredia |date=2001-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524151549/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2001%2F04%2F10%2FMN198145.DTL |url-status=dead |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}</ref> In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E.

Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.\n\nIn August 2005, a report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] states that \"the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/2005/0818list.htm|title=U.S. Commission on Civil Rights - FOIA|author=|date=|website=www.usccr.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Chairman [[Gerald A. Reynolds]] explained, \"Federal agencies do not independently evaluate, conduct research, collect data, or periodically review programs to determine whether race-neutral strategies will provide an adequate alternative to race-conscious programs.\" Civil rights groups expressed concern that the report was an attack on affirmative action inconsistent with [[Grutter v. Bollinger]].\n\nIn his first term, Bush appointed [[Colin Powell]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Powell was the first [[African-American]] man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by [[Condoleezza Rice]]: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed [[Alberto Gonzales]] as the [[United States Attorney General]], the first [[Hispanic]] to hold that position.\n\nBush met with the [[National Urban League]], the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well.\n\n===Genetic Non-Discrimination===\nPresident George W. Bush signed into law the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/24519851|title=Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008|author=|date=|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/GINAMay2008.pdf</ref> The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment.

Bush|President Bush]] supported adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. However, Bush opposed any new embryonic [[stem cell research]], and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] on January 19, 1999,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published. The guidelines were released under Clinton on August 23, 2000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} They allowed use of unused frozen [[embryo]]s.

The CEV would be used to return American [[astronaut]]s to the [[Moon]] by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent [[lunar base]], and eventually sending future manned missions to [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/01/14/bush.space/index.html | work=CNN | title=Bush unveils vision for moon and beyond | date=2004-01-14 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> To this end, the plan proposes that [[NASA]]'s budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/54873main_budget_chart_14jan04.pdf \"Strategy Based on Long-Term Affordability\"] - A January 14, 2006 graph showing a plan for NASA's long-term budget.</ref> The planned retirement of the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign.<ref>http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/8572141.htm?1c</ref> Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.\n\nSupporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from [[NASA]]'s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.\n\n[[File:BUSHOVALWTC.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] have caused concern about increasing inflation.\n\nLong-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s.

Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \"[[Bush tax cuts]]\".\n\nThe cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard [[Standard deduction|income tax deduction]] for married couples, eliminated the [[estate tax]], and reduced [[marginal tax rate]]s. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.\n\nBush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid%3D21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084200/http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=21 |archivedate=2005-12-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Bush visits NSA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W.

The CBO noted, however, that this projection \"omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year \u2014 and possibly for some time to come \u2014 for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]].\" The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts \"will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.\" If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then \"the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.\" Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.\n\nFederal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years. Non-defense spending increased 18% in that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|date=|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121046/https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|archive-date=29 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense.

Growth under President Bush was cut to 6.2% in his first budget, 5.5% in his second, 4.3% in his third, and 2.2% in his fourth.\n\n=== Trade ===\nBush supports free trade policies and legislation but has resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. [[Tariffs]] on imported [[steel]] imposed by the White House in March 2002 were lifted after the [[World Trade Organization]] ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had \"achieved their purpose\", and \"as a result of changed economic circumstances\", it was time to lift them.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/05/bush_lifts_steel_import_tariffs/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Bush lifts steel import tariffs | date=2003-12-05 | first1=Wayne | last1=Washington}}</ref>\n\nPresident Bush signed a large number of free trade agreements into law during his Presidency: Jordan (2001), Singapore and Chile (2004), Australia (2005), Dominican Republic, CAFTA, Morocco, Oman, and Bahrain (2006), and Oman and Peru (2009).\n\nThe Bush administration also launched trade negotiations with New Zealand, Thailand, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, with some being completed during President Obama's first term in office (2009-2013).\n\n=== Regulation ===\n\nSome say economic regulation expanded rapidly during the Bush administration.

The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that the percentage of the population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm|title=Table A-1.

Bush Omaha panel (cropped).jpg|thumb|Shortly after his second inauguration, Bush (here seen with a panel in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) toured the nation to promote his proposal for [[Social Security (United States)]] personal accounts.]]\n{{main|Social Security debate (United States)}}\nBush is an advocate of the partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] wherein an individual would be free to invest a portion of his Social Security taxes in personal retirement accounts.\n\nBush has called for major changes in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], identifying the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending \"crisis\". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax ([[FICA tax|FICA]]) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.\n\nMost Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the [[United Kingdom]]'s privatized pension plan. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]]. In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.\n\n== Capital punishment ==\nGeorge W. Bush is a strong supporter of [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were [[capital punishment in Texas|executed in that state]], maintaining its record as the leading state in [[execution (legal)|executions]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/01/13/death-in-texas/|title=Death in Texas|first=Sister Helen|last=Prejean|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=29 March 2018|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.nybooks.com}}</ref> As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist [[Timothy McVeigh]].

Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding.

Significant support for the act came from [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Concerned Women for America]], Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.\n\n=== Energy ===\nIn 2005\u201306, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of renewable sources of energy such as [[hydrogen power]], [[nuclear power]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], and [[clean coal|clean coal technologies]]. Bush proposed the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]] which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. In the 2007 State of the Union speech, President Bush proposed a 20:10 policy, where, as a nation, the United States would be working to reduce 20% of the national energy usage in next 10 years by converting to ethanol.\n\n=== Tariffs ===\nBush's imposition of a [[United States steel tariff 2002|tariff on imported steel]] and [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute|on Canadian softwood lumber]] was controversial in light of his advocacy of [[free market]] [[policies]] in other areas.
