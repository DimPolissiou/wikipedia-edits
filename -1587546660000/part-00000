The date is given by Velleius Paterculus.}} was the final and decisive battle of the [[Sulla's second civil war|second civil war]] between [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] and the Marians. Sulla won and secured control of Rome and Italy. [[Appian]] is the only source who provides details about the battle.\n\nMuch of the war was fought in northern Italy. The Lucanians, the Samnites, and the Gauls fought alongside the Marians. Following defection of the Gauls to the forces of Sulla and the defeat of some of his forces by [[Metellus Pius|Metellus]] (one of Sulla's lieutenants) near Placentia ([[Piacenza]]), [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 85 BC)|Carbo]], the leader of the Marians, fled to Africa. His lieutenants, [[Gaius Carrinas (general)|Gaius Carrinas]], [[Gaius Marcius Censorinus (general)|Gaius Marcius Censorinus]], and Damasippus tried to force their way through a pass controlled by Sulla's men with all their forces and with the Samnites. This failed and they marched on Rome.\n\n==Prelude==\nWhen Sulla found out the Samnites were moving on Rome he sent his cavalry ahead to hinder them while he himself force-marched his army to the capital. The Samnite army arrived first, at daybreak, causing a lot of consternation in the city. After the first shock wore off the Romans sent out a cavalry force to delay the attackers. Unfortunately for the Romans, the battle-hardened Samnites easily dispatched the cavalry attack killing many of them. However, the delay did allow a cavalry detachment sent ahead by Sulla to catch their breath, organize, and begin harassing the enemy. The arrival of Sulla's cavalry proved to the Romans and Samnites alike that Sulla was on his way. Telesinus decided to wait for Sulla's arrival and deployed his army slightly away from the Colline Gate. Sulla's main army arrived at noon and set up camp near to the temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Erucina]], outside the walls of Rome, not far from the Colline Gate.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 144-145; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 178; Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 92.</ref>\n\n==The Battle==\nSulla's commanders were concerned by the state of his soldiers after their forced-march. They pointed out that they were not up against the disorganized Marians, whom they had easily beat time and again, but against the Samnites and Lucanians \u2212 highly motivated, experienced, and warlike opponents. They urged Sulla to wait and let his soldiers recuperate over night. But Sulla only allowed his men a meal and a few hours rest. Then he organized his battle lines, and at four o'clock, with the sun already sinking, the battle began.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 146; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 179.</ref>\n\nAfter a lot of hard fighting Sulla's left wing was driven backwards until they literally had their backs to the wall. The rearmost ranks tried to seek shelter inside the walls, but the soldiers manning the walls dropped the [[portcullis]] on them and forced them to fight on. Sulla rode over to his left wing and tried to recover the situation; he pleaded with his men, he threatened some, he even physically turned some round to face the enemy. The ranks he was trying to keep were shattered with heavy casualties. Eventually, Sulla and the bulk of the left ended up in their camp. That is when messengers arrived from [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] who had taken command of the right wing while Sulla gave his full attention to the left. Crassus reported that his men had completely routed the enemy facing them. He wanted to know if he could have supplies now to break for supper. Sulla used Crassus' victory to boost the morale of his men and counter-attacked the Samnites.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 146-147; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 180-181.</ref>\n\nThe battle continued through the night. [[Gaius Carrinas (general)|Gaius Carrinas]], a Marian commander, and [[Pontius Telesinus]], the Samnite commander, were killed and their camp was seized. Marcius, Carrinas, and [[Marcus Lamponius]], the Lucanian, fled. Eventually, the entire enemy army broke and fled. The death toll was estimated at 50,000. There were 6,000-8,000 prisoners.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 147; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 181; [[Appian]], ''The Civil Wars'', 1.92-93.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nMarcius and Carrinas were captured and brought in the next day. Sulla killed them. He sent his lieutenant, [[Quintus Lucretius Ofella|Lucretius]], to show their heads before the walls of Praeneste ([[Palestrina]]), where [[Gaius Marius the Younger]] was besieged. [[Velleius Paterculus]] wrote that Sulla ordered the head of Telesinus to be carried around the walls of Praeneste fixed on top of a spear. He did not mention Marcius and Carrinas.<ref>[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Compendium of Roman History'', 2.27.1-6.</ref>\n\nThe people of Praeneste understood that the Marian army had been destroyed and that Sulla controlled Italy. They surrendered. Marius hid in a tunnel and committed suicide. His head was cut off and displayed in Rome. Some senators who had held command under Marius were killed by Sulla when he reached Praeneste and some were imprisoned. The inhabitants were divided into Romans, Samnites, and Praenestians. Then a herald told the Romans that they deserved to die but they were pardoned. The men of the other two groups were killed. [[Norba]], a town which still resisted, was taken by treachery. The inhabitants strangled themselves with ropes or fell on each other's swords. Others set fire to the town.<ref>[[Appian]], ''The Civil Wars'', 1, 93-94.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-roman}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', Book 1, Penguin Classics; New Edition 1996; {{ISBN|978-0140445091}}\n\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n\n[[Category:82 BC]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Roman Republic|Colline Gate 82 BC]]\n[[Category:80s BC conflicts|the Colline Gate (82 BC)]]\n[[Category:Battles of Sulla's second civil war|the Colline Gate (82 BC)]]\n[[Category:Night battles|the Colline Gate (82 BC)]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC battles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of the Colline Gate\n| width       = \n| partof      = [[Sulla's second civil war]]\n| image       = The British Library - Rome - Porta Collina.jpg\n| image_size  = \n| alt         = \n| caption     = Porta Collina\n| date        = 1 November 82 BC\n| place       = [[Porta Collina]], [[Rome]], [[Roman Italy|Italy]]\n| coordinates = <!--Use the {{coord}} template -->\n| result      = Decisive Sullan victory\n| combatant1  = Sullans ([[Optimates]])\n| combatant2  = Marians<br> \u2022 [[Populares]]<br>\u2022 [[Samnites]]<br>\u2022 [[Lucanians]]\n| commander1  = [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]<br />[[Quintus Lucretius Ofella]]<br />[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]\n| commander2  = [[Gaius Marcius Censorinus (general)|Gaius Marcius Censorinus]]<br />[[Pontia gens|Pontius]] Telesinus{{KIA}}<br />[[Gaius Carrinas (general)|Gaius Carrinas]]{{KIA}}<br />Marcus [[Lamponia (gens)|Lamponius]]\n| strength1   = \n| strength2   = \n| casualties1 = \n| casualties2 = \n}}\n{{Campaignbox Sulla's second civil war}}\n\nThe '''Battle of the Colline Gate''', fought on the Kalends of November 82 BC,{{efn-lr|November 1.

The college comprises a modern, five-storey, multi-function complex and caters for Year 10, 11 and 12 students.\n\nThe college is characterised by its adult learning environment and its different approach to senior secondary education. Noticeably absent are extra-curricular activities, extensive sporting programs, festivals and other activities which are a feature of traditional schools. As a result, teachers are available outside scheduled class times for extensive one-to-one support. Students are encouraged to see their teachers as colleagues and are free to address them by their first name.\n\nEynesbury is known for its record of consistent academic success. The median [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] of its students has been around 87-90 each year with about 95% going on to undertake tertiary studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/sace-results |title=SACE Results 2014|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n===Eynesbury House===\n{{Infobox historic site \n| name = Eynesbury House \n| native_name = \n| native_language = \n| image = Eynesbury House, Adelaide.jpg \n| image_size = 270px\n| caption =  The Kingswood Campus: ''Eynesbury House'', pictured in 2008\n| type = Former dwelling; now educational institution\n| locmapin = \n| coordinates = <!-- {{Coord}} --> \n| location = 69 Belair Road, {{SAcity|Kingswood}}, [[South Australia]]\n| area = {{convert|14|acre|ha|order=flip}}\n| built = 1880-1881\n| built_for = William Martin Letchford\n| architect = \n| architecture = [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]]\n| governing_body = \n| owner = Eynesbury Senior College\n| designation1 = South Australian Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Eynesbury House (former dwelling)\n| designation1_date = 12 January 1984\n| designation1_number = 11526\n}}\n''Eynesbury House'' is a heritage-listed late-[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] former mansion located at 69 Belair Road, in the Adelaide suburb of [[Kingswood, South Australia|Kingswood]].<ref name=ESA>{{cite web |author=Iwanicki, Iris; Register Historian |url=https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/11526_Research.pdf |title=Eynesbury House |work=Register of State Heritage Items: Item Evaluation Sheet |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=8 June 1982 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/heritagesearch/HeritageItem.aspx?p_heritageno=3616 |title=Eynesbury House |work=SA Heritage Places Database |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=12 January 1984 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref> The mansion was built by William Martin Letchford (1824\u20131880) on {{convert|14|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of land subdivided in 1854.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/letchford-children.html |title=Letchford Children|work=Clipper ship: City of Adelaide |date= |access-date= }}</ref> With the death of Letchford's second wife in 1872, he moved to Glenelg and sold the property to businessman [[George Wilcox (businessman)|George Wilcox]] who named it ''Eynesbury'' and enhanced it considerably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/george-and-annie-wilcox.html |title=George and Annie Wilcox |work=Clipper ship: City of Adelaide |date= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe name of the house was derived from [[Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire]], in England.\n\nAt one stage, the house was occupied by [[Hare Krishnas]] and the transition from the temple to Eynesbury College was completed in 1989 after the establishment of a laboratory and library.\n\n===Eynesbury College===\nEynesbury became a registered school on 1 October 1989. The first intake of Year 11 and Year 12 students was in mid-January 1990, with an initial enrolment of 140 students. The school was initially registered as Eynesbury House Senior Secondary College. However it became known as Eynesbury College.<ref>Stimson, Tony. ''Eynesbury Times'' Term One 2008, p.12.</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nBy 1995 the school had outgrown the Kingswood Campus and, in January 1996, a second larger campus was opened in [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]] in the heart of the city of Adelaide. Eynesbury remained a two-campus school until the end of 2001, when teaching was consolidated at an expanded and upgraded Franklin Street campus.<ref name=prospectus>About Eynesbury - History, ''Prospectus January 2008'', p.3.</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} Redevelopment of the Franklin Street campus took place over several stages. The first stage involved an extensive upgrade of electrical services, fire protection and the construction of laboratories. This was followed with the rebuilding of reception areas, the construction of additional computing classrooms and science laboratories, and the redevelopment of the outdoor terrace on the second floor as a modern, cafe-style recreation area for students. A new Drama centre was opened in July 2005. In Eynesbury's largest single capital development, the building's air conditioning plant was replaced in 2006.<ref name=prospectus/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} The original two lifts of the Franklin Street campus were replaced in early 2009.\n\nEynesbury celebrated its 20th birthday in 2009 with the opening of a new campus. Located in Coglin Street, Adelaide, the new campus is the location for the majority of Eynesbury's international students. The Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology (EIBT) moved to the new campus in April 2009 and other programs followed soon after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |title=Coglin Street Campus New Building Flyer |accessdate=2010-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220022102/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Senior High School===\nAs a specialist college with students only in Years 10, 11 and 12, emphasis is placed on helping students prepare for tertiary studies.

Students wishing to enrol for Year 12 must begin at the start of the year. These entry points are undertaken after an extensive interview process, where future plans and directions, along with approaches to independent learning, are discussed. Eynesbury supports the notion of individualised programming, and increasing numbers of students undertake subjects at more than one year level. Subject choices are the final phase of the entry process.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThere is an expectation that all students are engaged in full-time study at all times of their enrolment. Part-time study is typically only taken by students in [[Year 13]] who wish to 'top-up' their results from Year 12. Under new legislation in South Australia, from 1 January 2009, all students under 17 years of age are to be engaged in full-time study or full-time work.<ref name=guide/>\n\n====Year 10====\nAll students in Year 10 at Eynesbury study a combination of core and choice subjects. Core subjects are compulsory and include English/English as a Second Language, 'Learning about Thinking', Mathematics, Science and Studies of Society and Environment. These subjects are taken over the whole year. Possible choice subjects are: ASX Stock Exchange Challenge, Business Studies (Financial Literacy), Debating, Creative Writing, Drama, French, Health and Nutrition, Introduction to History, History Through Film, Electronic and Digital Publishing, Physical Education and Visual investigations.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nStudents who earn an A grade in their subjects in Semester 1 may be offered an opportunity to join regular Stage 1 classes in those or related subjects in Semester 2.

All Year 10 students are involved in the Eynesbury Mentor Program which incorporates the Personal Learning Plan.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 11====\nAll students in Year 11 at Eynesbury study a minimum of 110 credits (a whole year program), even if some Stage 1 units have already been completed. Students will be required to select 100 credits in addition to undertaking the Personal Learning Plan (10 credits) if necessary and the start of the Research Project.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following subjects are offered at Stage 1 level: Accounting, Ancient Studies, Australian and International Politics, Biology, Business and Enterprise, Chemistry, Drama, Economics, English, English as a Second Language (ESL), Environmental Studies, French (Beginners Level), French (Continuers Level), Geography, Information Technology Systems, Japanese (Continuers Level), Legal Studies, Mathematics, Modern History, Physics, Psychology, Visual Arts - Art, Visual Arts - Design.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nSubject changes usually only occur once the first semester of study has been completed. Should a student wish to make a subject change, a request must be put in writing to the Director of Studies halfway through Term 2. After the end of Term 2, subject changes will only be possible in unusual circumstances and at the discretion of the Director of Studies.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Year 12====\nTo be eligible for selection to a university program or course a student must have completed 80 credits of Tertiary Admissions Subjects (TAS).

Students enrolled in Standard FSP study several of their subjects with Australian Year 12 High School students, e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, economics and others.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThree courses are compulsory for all FSP students: \n:Language and Communication (4 hours per week - full course), \n:International Studies (2 hours - half course), and \n:Clear Thinking and Logic (2 hours - half course).<ref name=FSP/>\n\n*Students undertaking the Standard FSP (or Stage 2 of the Extended FSP) must take at least three electives from any of the five streams of specialisation. The five streams of specialisation are: \n**Business (Accounting, Economics), \n**Humanities (Australian and International Politics, Environmental Studies, Modern History), \n**Health Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics), \n**Engineering (Additional Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics) and \n**Science (Additional Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology). \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in April) must choose at least three electives from the Science, Business, Health Sciences and Engineering streams and Environmental Studies. \n*Students taking the Accelerated FSP (starting in September) must take at least three elective courses from the Engineering and Business streams only. \nStudents attend four hours per week for each elective course.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAn Accelerated FSP commences in April and ends in December. The Standard and Accelerated programs both lead to the February intake of university. In addition, an Accelerated FSP commencing in September prepares students for mid-year (July) entry to university. The Accelerated FSP is ideally suited to students with above average academic and language skills. The Accelerated courses mostly cover the same content as the Standard FSP, but some applications of theory may be omitted.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nStudent assessments for Standard and Accelerated FSP are based on work completed throughout the year and on a final examination held at the end of the course. Each full course is marked out of 100 and the marks of the two half courses (50 each) are added together and counted as one full course. An aggregate score out of 500 is calculated. For students taking three electives this is a simple addition of all marks. Students must achieve a score of 60% or more in Language and Communication, and 275 overall to be considered for admission, subject to specific degree entry scores and quotas. This provides a base score for consideration for entry to Australian universities.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n====Extended Foundation Studies Program====\nThe Extended FSP is suitable for students who require some additional language development and/or revision in key academic areas. The Extended Program is 4 terms (15 months) in duration. Students take some of the first term (13 weeks) in separate classes specifically designed for Extended Foundation students with a focus on key competencies, skills and content essential for success at Foundation level. During this term, students take three 10-week Core courses (compulsory) and the equivalent of two 10-week Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nThe following courses are compulsory: Language and Study Skills, An Introduction to Communication and Critical Thinking, Mathematics. Students select the equivalent of two full courses from the following introductory areas: An Introduction to Biological Sciences (Biology, Chemistry), An Introduction to the Pure Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Additional Mathematics) and An Introduction to International Business (Accounting, Economics).<ref name=FSP/>\n\nIn January, successful Extended Program students join students from the Standard Foundation Studies Program and are integrated into classes with Australian and International Year 12 students for several Elective courses.<ref name=FSP/>\n\nAssessment is conducted in two stages. The first stage is the assessment of Term 1 courses (as listed above). The assessment of Term 2 \u2013 5 courses as per the Standard Foundation Studies Program is the second stage of evaluation. Assessment at both stages is based on 50% continuous assessment and 50% for final examinations. Results in the first stage are used to assess successful transition to the second stage. They are not used for the final assessment in the second stage or transition to university.<ref name=FSP/>\n\n==Scholarships==\nEynesbury offers the equivalent of 6-8 full-time enrolments as scholarships (typically broken down into 2 x 100%, 4 x 50% and 8 x 25%). These scholarships are generally intended for students entering Year 10 or 11 and remain in force for an entire academic career at Eynesbury. Offers are based on an aptitude test, a 200-300 word personal statement, past academic and community achievement in addition to an interview with the principal. The scholarship selection process takes place twice per year in Term 1 and Term 3. Official dates are published in the local press, the Eynesbury website and its newsletter, Eynesbury Times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/scholarships- |title=Scholarships |accessdate=2015-01-13 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Schools|South Australia}}}}\n* [[List of schools in South Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110220010805/http://www.eibt.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121150322/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/ Eynesbury International website]\n\n[[Category:Private secondary schools in Adelaide]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{self-published|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name \t        = Eynesbury Senior College\n| logo \t        = ESClogo.png\n| image         = Eynesbury.JPG\n| image_size    = \n| caption       = The Franklin Street college campus\n| motto         = Many faces, different pathways - one goal...\n| address       = 15-19 [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]],<br/>[[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]\n| postcode      = 5000\n| country       = Australia\n| coordinates   = {{Coord|34|55|39|S|138|35|54|E|type:edu_region:AU-SA|display=inline,title}}\n| pushpin_map = South Australia\n| pushpin_image =\n| pushpin_mapsize = 270px\n| pushpin_map_alt = \n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in [[South Australia]]\n| pushpin_label = \n| pushpin_label_position = \n| type          = [[Independent school#Australia|Independent]] [[senior high school]]\n| established \t= {{Start date and age|1989}}\n| principal     = Claire Flenley\n| founder       = Tony Stimson\n| affiliation \t=\n| staff         = \n| enrolment     =\n| years         = [[Year 10|10]] - [[Year 12|12]]\n| oversight     = \n| accreditation = \n| mascot        = \n| colours       = \n| newspaper     = Eynesbury Times\n| yearbook      = \n| website \t= {{URL|www.esc.sa.edu.au}}\n}}\n\n'''Eynesbury Senior College''' is an [[Independent school|independent]] [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] [[senior high school]] on [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]] in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] of [[Adelaide]], the capital of [[South Australia]]. The college comprises a modern, five-storey, multi-function complex and caters for Year 10, 11 and 12 students.\n\nThe college is characterised by its adult learning environment and its different approach to senior secondary education. Noticeably absent are extra-curricular activities, extensive sporting programs, festivals and other activities which are a feature of traditional schools. As a result, teachers are available outside scheduled class times for extensive one-to-one support. Students are encouraged to see their teachers as colleagues and are free to address them by their first name.\n\nEynesbury is known for its record of consistent academic success. The median [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] of its students has been around 87-90 each year with about 95% going on to undertake tertiary studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esc.sa.edu.au/index.php/education/sace-results |title=SACE Results 2014|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n===Eynesbury House===\n{{Infobox historic site \n| name = Eynesbury House \n| native_name = \n| native_language = \n| image = Eynesbury House, Adelaide.jpg \n| image_size = 270px\n| caption =  The Kingswood Campus: ''Eynesbury House'', pictured in 2008\n| type = Former dwelling; now educational institution\n| locmapin = \n| coordinates = <!-- {{Coord}} --> \n| location = 69 Belair Road, {{SAcity|Kingswood}}, [[South Australia]]\n| area = {{convert|14|acre|ha|order=flip}}\n| built = 1880-1881\n| built_for = William Martin Letchford\n| architect = \n| architecture = [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]]\n| governing_body = \n| owner = Eynesbury Senior College\n| designation1 = South Australian Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Eynesbury House (former dwelling)\n| designation1_date = 12 January 1984\n| designation1_number = 11526\n}}\n''Eynesbury House'' is a heritage-listed late-[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] former mansion located at 69 Belair Road, in the Adelaide suburb of [[Kingswood, South Australia|Kingswood]].<ref name=ESA>{{cite web |author=Iwanicki, Iris; Register Historian |url=https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/11526_Research.pdf |title=Eynesbury House |work=Register of State Heritage Items: Item Evaluation Sheet |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=8 June 1982 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/heritagesearch/HeritageItem.aspx?p_heritageno=3616 |title=Eynesbury House |work=SA Heritage Places Database |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=12 January 1984 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref> The mansion was built by William Martin Letchford (1824\u20131880) on {{convert|14|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of land subdivided in 1854.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/letchford-children.html |title=Letchford Children|work=Clipper ship: City of Adelaide |date= |access-date= }}</ref> With the death of Letchford's second wife in 1872, he moved to Glenelg and sold the property to businessman [[George Wilcox (businessman)|George Wilcox]] who named it ''Eynesbury'' and enhanced it considerably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/george-and-annie-wilcox.html |title=George and Annie Wilcox |work=Clipper ship: City of Adelaide |date= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe name of the house was derived from [[Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire]], in England.\n\nAt one stage, the house was occupied by [[Hare Krishnas]] and the transition from the temple to Eynesbury College was completed in 1989 after the establishment of a laboratory and library.\n\n===Eynesbury College===\nEynesbury became a registered school on 1 October 1989. The first intake of Year 11 and Year 12 students was in mid-January 1990, with an initial enrolment of 140 students. The school was initially registered as Eynesbury House Senior Secondary College. However it became known as Eynesbury College.<ref>Stimson, Tony. ''Eynesbury Times'' Term One 2008, p.12.</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nBy 1995 the school had outgrown the Kingswood Campus and, in January 1996, a second larger campus was opened in [[Franklin Street, Adelaide|Franklin Street]] in the heart of the city of Adelaide. Eynesbury remained a two-campus school until the end of 2001, when teaching was consolidated at an expanded and upgraded Franklin Street campus.<ref name=prospectus>About Eynesbury - History, ''Prospectus January 2008'', p.3.</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} Redevelopment of the Franklin Street campus took place over several stages. The first stage involved an extensive upgrade of electrical services, fire protection and the construction of laboratories. This was followed with the rebuilding of reception areas, the construction of additional computing classrooms and science laboratories, and the redevelopment of the outdoor terrace on the second floor as a modern, cafe-style recreation area for students. A new Drama centre was opened in July 2005. In Eynesbury's largest single capital development, the building's air conditioning plant was replaced in 2006.<ref name=prospectus/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}} The original two lifts of the Franklin Street campus were replaced in early 2009.\n\nEynesbury celebrated its 20th birthday in 2009 with the opening of a new campus. Located in Coglin Street, Adelaide, the new campus is the location for the majority of Eynesbury's international students. The Eynesbury Institute of Business and Technology (EIBT) moved to the new campus in April 2009 and other programs followed soon after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |title=Coglin Street Campus New Building Flyer |accessdate=2010-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220022102/http://www.eynesburyinternational.sa.edu.au/images/stories/eyne0023_new_building_flyer_lores.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Senior High School===\nAs a specialist college with students only in Years 10, 11 and 12, emphasis is placed on helping students prepare for tertiary studies.

Students wishing to enrol for Year 12 must begin at the start of the year. These entry points are undertaken after an extensive interview process, where future plans and directions, along with approaches to independent learning, are discussed. Eynesbury supports the notion of individualised programming, and increasing numbers of students undertake subjects at more than one year level. Subject choices are the final phase of the entry process.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThere is an expectation that all students are engaged in full-time study at all times of their enrolment. Part-time study is typically only taken by students in [[Year 13]] who wish to 'top-up' their results from Year 12. Under new legislation in South Australia, from 1 January 2009, all students under 17 years of age are to be engaged in full-time study or full-time work.<ref name=guide/>\n\n====Year 10====\nAll students in Year 10 at Eynesbury study a combination of core and choice subjects. Core subjects are compulsory and include English/English as a Second Language, 'Learning about Thinking', Mathematics, Science and Studies of Society and Environment. These subjects are taken over the whole year. Possible choice subjects are: ASX Stock Exchange Challenge, Business Studies (Financial Literacy), Debating, Creative Writing, Drama, French, Health and Nutrition, Introduction to History, History Through Film, Electronic and Digital Publishing, Physical Education and Visual investigations.<ref name=guide/>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nStudents who earn an A grade in their subjects in Semester 1 may be offered an opportunity to join regular Stage 1 classes in those or related subjects in Semester 2.
