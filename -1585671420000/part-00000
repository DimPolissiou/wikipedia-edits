The main source of Ayyavazhi mythology is the Ayyavazhi [[scripture]], [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]], and its supplement, [[Arul Nool]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian religions: tradition, history and culture |page=123|first=Dr. Preeti |last=Tripathy|year=2010|publisher=Axis Publications}}</ref> The [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]] is a recitation by ''[[Thirumal|Mayon]]'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for [[Vishnu]], or [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) to his consort [[Lakshmi]]. It is divided into three sections: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Early Avatars|Early Avatars]], [[#Incarnational events|incarnational events]] and [[#Post-incarnational events|post-incarnational events]].\n\n== Early Avatars ==\nThe early avatars are all those that occurred prior to the earthly incarnation of [[Vishnu|Mayon]].\n\n=== The first six Yugas ===\n\nThe first ''[[Yuga]]'' (\"aeon\" or \"era\") was called Neetiya Yuga.  During this time, divine, human and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. They did not fear [[demon]]s, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Universe, as well as among those who lived in the [[Fourteen Worlds]]. In this yuga, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means.\n\nDuring this peaceful time, [[Kroni]] was born. Kroni, who is analogous to [[Satan]] in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, is a primordial personification of [[evil]]. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yugas: as [[Ravana]] or [[Duryodhana]], for example. Likewise, Mayon also incarnates in different yugas as different ''[[Avatar]]s'': for example [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]].\n\nIn order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed ''[[Kailayam]]'', the abode of ''Sivan'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for [[Shiva]]), and then proceeded to devour the entire universe. [[Akilam one]]: 440-446. ([[oldwikisource:\u0ba8\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf \u0baf\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bae|text available at Wikisource]])\n\n[[Krishna|Mayon]], residing with [[Shiva|Sivan]] in ''Kailayam'', escaped to undertake ''[[tavam]]'' (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'', meaning \"austerity\") and to receive permission from Sivan to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six yukams in order to destroy the [[Six Fragments]] of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments and saved the universe. The first yuga thus came to an end.\n\nIn the second yuga, called ''[[Chathura Yukam|Chathura Yuga]]'', one of the six pieces of Kroni was formed into a creature named [[Kuntomasali]].  It had the shape and size of a mammoth [[leech]], and when it disturbed the tavam of those in [[Tava lokam]] (the land of austerity), Mayon destroyed the leech by catching it with a hook.\n\nIn the third yuga, called [[Netu Yukam|Netu Yuga]], another fragment of Kroni created two wicked individuals called [[Thillaimallalan]] and [[Mallosivahanan]]. They ruled over the people by extracting ''Uliyam'' and ''Iraikal'' ([[taxes]]) from them. When this exploitation became unbearable, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (celestial beings) complained to Sivan, who, in turn, commissioned Mayon to carry out the destruction of the wicked rulers, which he did.\n\nThe fourth yuga was called [[Kretha Yukam|Kretha Yuga]]. The third fragment of [[Kroni]] was, again, made into two siblings, called [[Suraparppan]] and [[Sinhamuka Asuran]], and they were given responsibility to rule the Earth. The wicked rulers began to crush the Devas, who reported it to Mayon. Mayon took the form of [[Kartikeya|Arumugan]], the Tamil name for [[Kartikeya]], and advised the rulers to desist from their wickedness. However, when they arrogantly spurned his advice, Arumugan eliminated them. During the same [[Yuga]], Suraparppan was created, this time as [[Hiranyakashipu|Iraniyan]]. Mayon, incarnated as the son of Iraniyan ([[Prahlada]]), challenged his authority and finally took on the [[therianthropic]] form of man and lion ([[Narasimha]]) by piercing his stomach. On his deathbed, Mayon asked him to repent, but he replied arrogantly: \"You cannot kill me. Only by placing ten mountains as ten nails might you kill me. Otherwise you can't.\"\n\nIn the ensuing yuga, called [[Thretha Yukam|Thretha Yuga]], Sivan, as per the request of Mayon, created the fourth piece of the primordial Kroni as a [[ten-headed mighty warrior]], with the ten mountains as ten heads, naming him as [[Ravana]]n. He oppressed all those living on Earth by extracting Uliyam from them. He subdued all the earthly kings and made them pay tributes to him. Suffering under his oppression, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] sought the help of Mayon who, for the purpose of destroying him, took birth as [[Rama]]n. On his death-bed, he repented, saying: \"Only with the help of my brother were you able to destroy me.\" With this episode of killing Ravanan, Thretha Yuga came to an end.\n\nIn the sixth [[yuga]], called [[Dwapara Yukam|Dwapara Yuga]], the fifth fragment of Kroni was portioned into a hundred pieces, and made into [[Duryodhana|Duriyodhanan]] and [[ninety-nine brothers]] to support him. The [[three brothers of Raman]], along with [[Vibushanan]]  and [[Sampoovan]] of the preceding epoch, were created as [[Pandava|Pancha Pandavas]] in this aeon. The wicked Duriyodhanan was killed by the Pancha Pandavas, with the support of Mayon, who came in the form of [[Krishna]]. Even at the brink of death, Duriyodhanan refused to repent, saying that \"only with your cunning mind were you able to defeat me, and otherwise not.\" Mayon then told him: \"You will be created with [[knowledge]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], and [[artist]]ic skill in the next Yukam, and if you do not repent in that age, that will be your eternal annihilation.\" Having said this, Mayon went to [[Srirangam]] and dwelt there.\n\n=== The Santror ===\n{{Main|The Santror}}\nTowards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], [[Thirumal]] (Mayon), with the aid of Seven Virgins ([[Saptha Kanniyar]]), had begotten seven sons, known as the [[Santror Makkal]] (see [[Santror Pirappu]]), in order to accomplish the task of destroying the [[Kalineesan]] and [[Kali mayai]] ([[Kali Yuga]] [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]]) that were to be countered in the following [[Kali Yuga]].\n\nAfter the birth of Santror, they were all named by conducting a naming ceremony (see [[The Naming ceremony of Santror]]) and fed with celestial nectar (see [[Feeding the children with Celestial Nectar]]). The Santror were raised by Bhadrakali and married to the daughters of Nirupathirajan (see [[Fostered by the acclaimed Deity Patrakali]]).\n\n=== Kalineesan, Kali Yuga, and Kalimayai ===\n{{main|Kaliyan}}\n\nThe sixth fragment of the primordial [[Kroni]] was [[Neesan]], the epitome of wickedness ((Tamil ''neesa'' meaning \"wickedness\"). Neesan was created in the form of a male [[human being]] who was wise, beautiful and intelligent. Neesan pushed himself out of the earth in an inverted form. Upon seeing his appearance, the celestial diviners predicted that he, being without normal human parentage, would have an undefined and rude physique, and that his intelligence and five senses would be rooted in falsehood. They further predicted that he would have a life as fragile as that of a bird, but he would unleash wickedness on people with arrogance.\n\nHaving obtained innumerable boons (see [[Boons claimed by Kaliyan|Boons]]), including the [[Chakra]] of Mayon and invincibility, Neesan proceeded to earth to rule over the people. On his way, he was accosted by [[Thirumal]], who appeared as a [[Pantaram]] (an [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] [[mendicant]]), with long flowing unkempt hair and torn clothes. Thirumal challenged him to a duel which Neesan refused, considering it beneath his dignity to fight with a Pantaram coming in such an attire without any weapon. Taking the opportune moment, Thirumal shrewdly made Neesan promise to forfeit all his boons if any of his lies caused trouble to any Pantaram on earth in the future.  Then, he bought the Chakra from Kaliyan and cursed it as money. The money asked Thirumal when this curse would leave it, to which Thirumal replied: \"It will leave you when Kali is defeated\".\n\nThe Neesan was thenceforth called [[Kalineesan]] because the [[Kali Yuga]] had dawned along with his birth. Along with him was born an evil force called [[Kali Mayai]] (Kali Yuga [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]]). The ''Kali'' here refers to the evil spirit behind ''Kali Yuga'' and not ''[[Kali]]'', the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity).\n\n[[Kali (demon)|Kali]] Maya engulfed the whole world and consequently, deceit and illusion began to contaminate the minds of the people. Age-old traditions and conventions, based on [[Dharma]]m, were unduly overthrown. Kalineesan introduced the discrimination of [[caste]] among the people. The powerless people were crushed with brute might. People, caught in the Kalimayai, began to be inimical towards one another - men against women, children against parents, and so forth. People used demonic force to harm one another. Kalimayai captured the king of [[Thiruvitankur]] and began to rule over the people as their king.\n\n=== Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram ===\n\n{{main|Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram}}\n\nThirumal, dwelling at [[Sri Rangam]] hitherto, found it unworthy of his abode because of the misdeeds of the priests there. He shifted his tent to [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. When he reached there, a [[Pulayar]] woman saw him and spread the news to one and all. Hearing of this, Kalineesan constructed a temple of fine granite at the site where the Pulayar woman spotted Tirumal, and decorated the temple with gold and pearls. The king instituted scores of rituals and ceremonies at the temple to be performed by [[Namboothiri]] [[Brahmins]]. The lights of the temple were, however, lit daily from a torch brought from the home of the Pulayar woman.\n\n==== Venneesan ====\n\n{{main|Venneesan}}\n\n[[Kalineesan]] had no children, so he went on a pilgrimage to [[Kingdom of Kashi|Kasi]], a holy place, and stood in ''[[tavam]]'' (spiritual suffering) for a son. While performing the ''tavam'', he was distracted by the scene of a cleric embracing a woman. Because of this, [[Kalineesan|Kalineesan's]] [[semen]] came out and fell into the water. A white crane came and swallowed the semen, became pregnant, and delivered a baby boy in the water. A sage, [[Punal Rhishi]], took the baby, which was white in appearance, and looked after it.\n\nKalineesan, his ''tavam'' being defective, returned to his country in despair, resigned to a prediction that even if he were to have a son, it would be only the sons of his sister who would rule the country.\n\nThe baby, delivered by the white crane, grew up and came of age, and was married in the land of [[Chenkomatti]]. He prospered there with his progeny, who later emerged as a powerful people by learning the skills of ship-travel, trading in gold and silver, and diplomacy. This people, called Venneesa kulam, propagated a religion of their own, and through the lure of money gained many new members. Venneesan (the name comes from two words, ''venmai'' meaning \"white,\" and ''neesan,'' meaning \"wicked person\") introduced a new calendar.\n\n==== Santror in Kali Yuga ====\n\nKalineesan, coming to know about the valour and loyalty of the Santror people, appointed them as his bodyguards. It so happened that one day, while guarding the entrance of the king\u2019s room, the body-guards happened to fall asleep, during which time, the enemies of the king, hailing from the king\u2019s own race, entered the room and assassinated the king. The Kalineesan, while succumbing to the murderous attack, mistaking it to be a betrayal by the body-guards, cursed them that they and their progeny would be oppressed with oozhiyam ([[coolie]] service) and [[regressive taxation]] as long as the king\u2019s dynasty ruled the country.\n \nThe curse of the king began to take effect on the Santror. The Kalineesan, the successor of the previous king, imposed innumerable taxes on every article used by the Santror for their day to day living. Their occupational implements, the [[Arecaceae|palmyra trees]] that supported them, and every item of the produce of these trees were punitively taxed. The produce of the palmyra trees was to be given to the high castes, failing which the Santror were tortured with [[corporal punishment]]s. There were many arbitrary taxes imposed on them. The Santror found no favour with the rules, in spite of paying these cruel taxes.\n\n==== Thirumal deserting Kalineesan ====\n\nHaving witnessed the woes of the Santror, Mayon admonished the king to desist from oppressing them. He reminded the king that it was his seventh birth, coming in the lineage of the primordial Kroni, and if he failed to repent during this opportunity, then it would be his eternal damnation. He exhorted him to revoke the cruel taxes and the exploitative system of uliyam, imposed on the Santror, the people born of Mayon's seeds.\n\nThe king retorted, saying:\n:\"How dare you advise me to revoke the taxes and the oozhiyam imposed on the low caste [[Chanar]]? If I do so, how else do I earn gold coins - a hundred of them needed to perform puja for you every morning and evening, a thousand of them needed to take care of all the temples and me, and a ten thousand of them needed to pay my staff? Do I not get these gold coins by squeezing the labour of these Chanar? Even if you desert me and go to one of the Chanar places, I will never revoke the taxes and oozhiyam imposed on them.\"\n\nResponding to the king, Mayon said:\n:\"Did I ever ask you to offer me [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] by exploiting the people? You offer puja not to me, but to the Namboothiri Brahmins. The whole world knows that the only thing that I receive whole-heartedly is the light brought by the [[Pulayar]] woman.\"\n \nPeeved at the response of Mayon, the king mockingly said: \"If you have not tasted any of my offerings, what then have you to do with me? Go wherever you want to...\" Listening to the impenitent and brute words of the king, divine rage overcame Mayon and he said: \"You have mocked at me and ill-treated me as you do to the Chanar. Lo, I am going away from your place to [[Thiruchendur]]. I will take on you in another form. Then, I will perform a [[Dharma]]m that you and the world will acknowledge as the greatest. I will destroy the pervasive demonic cult and crown the Chanar\".\n\nHaving said these things, Mayon deserted [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. He told the people: \"Henceforth, let all castes united as one people, come to the place where I am going to dwell\". Having said this, he proceeded to Thiruchendur. It happened then that the fortress of the Kalineesan crashed into pieces. The earth was covered with darkness of slumber, the sea engulfed the land, and all the palatial buildings of the king were effaced.  Seeing these calamities, the Brahmins lamented and the priests wailed.\n \nMayon took his abode at the seashore of Thiruchendur. During this time, the venneesan had spread his wicked rule over the country, trampling upon the traditions of the land. He flouted the principles of ''Dharma'', observed by the Santror and failed to give the dignity due to them.\n\n== Incarnational events ==\n\nIncarnational events include preparations for incarnation, the event of incarnation, and the proclamations and instructions given to the newly incarnated god. Since [[Vishnu|Mayon's]] incarnation, as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Lord Vaikundar]], is the foremost power, this is considered to be the most important part in [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]]. Below is an elaboration of these events.\n\n=== Preparing for incarnation ===\n\nSeeing the degraded status of the Santror, the celestial gods made a plea to [[Vishnu|Mayon]] as follows: \"Our young brothers, the Santror, are suffering endlessly under the yoke of the centuries old oozhiyam and have lost dignity and respect on account of that. Have you not seen their iniquities?\" \n \nAfter listening to the plea, [[Vishnu|Mayon]] prepared for the incarnation. He made all the celestial gods take birth in the world in order to assist in destroying the kali. He set out to create new [[cattle]], [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[plant]]s, [[tree]]s, and all other elements of nature that would befit the new age of [[Dharma Yukam]] because the Dharma Yukam was to be characterised by a new life, new people, and new thinking. In that new age [[Shastra]]s, [[Veda]]s and all the religions would be the same; the Tamil language would permeate the world; people would live united as a single humanity; the people of Mayon would live with pristine glory and they would flourish with all prosperity; the earth would yield abundantly; diseases, calamities and the impact of the evil magical practices would not affect the people; the old Shastras would be turned untrue, and instead, a new code would be enshrined.\n\n=== Mayon &mdash; on the identity of his people ===\n\nMayon then enunciated the attributes of his children who would be his collaborators in the world. He said:\n\n:\"The identity of my people is that they do not offer puja or sacrifices, do not have temples and priests, do not have offerings of flowers, do not offer [[blood sacrifice]]s of goat, bull and [[rooster]]s, and do not worship cows and images made of clay. Instead, they are those who do [[Dharma]]m to all those who come in my name.\"\n\n=== Final admonition through Thiruvasakam ===\n\nBefore the incarnation of Mayon could take place, the [[Trimurti|three godheads]] decided to send a final admonition with the name of Thiruvasakam to [[Kali (demon)|Kalineesan]] that he might amend''. (see : [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)]])''\n\n=== Deciding to incarnate as Vaikundar ===\n\n{{main|Vishnu}}\n\n[[Kali (demon)|Kalineesan]] did not pay heed to the Thiruvasakam. [[Vishnu|Mayon]] then decided to incarnate as Vaikundar and, to that effect, walked towards the seashore of Thiruchendur. \n \nWhen the day came, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] then instantly went into the sea, amidst the chanting of the celestial gods. Inside the sea, enveloping himself in a scorching flame, he approached [[Lakshmi]] who was awaiting his arrival in the form of a Lotus pedestal. Afraid of the ball of flame approaching her, [[Lakshmi]] worshipped it with reverence. Mayon revealed himself and took Lakshmi and told her of his intention to create a son. By that time, [[Vishnu|Mayon]] had come into the sea. Then, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity Goddess Lakshmi, he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of Tiruchendur on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday).\n[[File:Lord Vaikundar Avatar.jpg|thumb|Incarnation of Lord Vaikundar]]\n\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of Akilattirattu Ammanai with the grace of God!\n\n\u201c \u2018O\u2019 Lord you took avatar for Pandavas and eliminated their enemies. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of Kaliyan. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma\u201d \n\n\u201cOn Masi 1008, I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar\u201d \u2013 Akilattirattu\n\nAkilattirattu says, Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I (Lord Narayana) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 Akilattirattu\n\nHe then imparted certain arcane knowledge in the form of proclamations and instructions, known as [[Vinchai]], to his newly niall son, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. ''(see: [[Vinchai to Vaikundar]])''\n\nHaving given these exhortations, Mayon called his son intimately as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Narayana Vaikundar]] and told him that if these teachings were observed strictly, the illusory force of kali would be contained and when people learned to live with [[self-respect]], [[Kali]] would destroy itself.\n\nThen the whole array of celestial gods sang lullabies (See:[[Thalattu]], [[Palli Unarthal]], [[Abayam]].), praising the special attributes of the newly born child, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. They praised him for having been born as the child of Mayon, in the race of Chanar, in order to teach the virtue of Dharmam to the world and to incinerate [[Kali]].\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Lord Vaikundar]], having received all the instructions from his father, walked out of the sea to go into the world. Mayon sent two celestial sages (Kalai Muni and Gnana Muni) with him as witnesses to his activities. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\n== Post-incarnational events ==\n\n{{Main|Ayya Vaikundar}}\n\nThe various episodes, that are portrayed to be occurring after the event of incarnation, are called here as post-incarnational events. Given below is an elaboration of them.\n\n=== Vaikundar's emergence out of the sea ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] crossed over to the land from the sea and showing a human appearance as Narayana Pantaram to the mother of [[Sampooranathevan|Muthukutty (alias Sampoornadevan)]], told her: \"Woman, you had been [[Sampooranathevan|Muthukutty]] mother before the year 1008 (AD 1833). I (Narayana) have been born as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the child of Mayon. I have received powers for redeeming the Santror. I am going to destroy the evilmongers and rule the world under a single command.\" Having said this, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] set out towards [[Detchanam]] (Dakshin, the south).\n\n=== Vaikundar's journey to Detchanam ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] walked towards Detchanam, along the sea route. All along his path, the creatures of the sea and the animals of the forest greeted him, expressing their happiness, for they were to be freed from the clutches of Kali. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], announcing the glad tidings to everyone, traversed the path towards [[Manavaippathi]] ([[Puvantantoppu]]) in Detchanam. The itinerant [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], reaching the temple of [[Pakavathi]] at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], told her that he, the [[Ayya Vaikundar|Narayana Vaikundar]], had come to uplift the lowly by ruling the world under the banner of Dharmam and therefore, she was to rescind from accepting any sacrifices or offerings.\n\n=== Tavam ===\n{{main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}\n\nMaking himself known to the people as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the great [[Narayana]] took his abode under a tree at the entrance of Manavaippathi.\n\n=== Burning of the demons ===\n\nWhen a year and a half had passed after undertaking the Tavam, people complained to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] of the disturbances caused by the demons in the world. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], intending to put an end to the misdeeds of the demons, thought of incinerating them totally. He then summoned a celestial sage and sought his counsel on this matter. The sage, after going through the [[Akamankal]] ([[Hindu Agamas|Agamas]]), told [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]:\n\n:''From the moment [[Narayana]] became [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and came to the world, the demons, the evil spirits and all other deceptions of the world are disappearing; [[Kali]] Yukam is being destroyed, together with the old [[Veda]]s. [[Purana]]s and [[Hindu Agamas|Agamas]] have lost their substance. As of now, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] is establishing a Dharma Yukam that he will rule eternally. So, now is the right time to destroy all that are to be destroyed.''\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then assembled all the demons in one place. He made some persons in the gathering, who were accustomed to \u2018possession\u2019, to get \u2018possessed\u2019 of the demons in the presence of the people. The demons that had \u2018come on to these persons\u2019 began to tremble with fear and, by making loud cries, bemoaned their end. Resigned to their fate, they requested [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] to tell them the modalities to surrender. When the demons asked it themselves, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] ordered them to make an oath in front of the people that they had surrendered all their powers. Accordingly, the demons made a public oath that they had surrendered all their powers. Then they fled to the mountain and killed themselves by falling into fire. As this happened, those that were dancing due to the \u2018possession\u2019 of the demons got exhausted and fell flat on the grounds. As the crowd was witnessing all these happenings, a few shepherds, tending their flock in the mountain, came rushing and reported that they heard the loud cries of the demons as they were falling in the fire. When the crowd heard these, they appreciated the way the demons were destroyed and acknowledged that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was really the Narayanar needed for the country.\n\n=== Seizing the power of magic, witchcraft, sorcery, trickery, etc. ===\n\nHaving destroyed the demons, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] thought of incarcerating the powers of [[Malaiyarasar]], the people of the mountain who performed [[black magic]], [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], etc., with the aid of [[evil spirits]]. No sooner had he thought of it than the [[wild animal]]s, being released from the clutches of the Malaiyaracar, went berserk and attacked the people ferociously. Horrified at the behaviour of the animals, the Malaiyaracar resorted to their usual black magic to contain the animals. But, alas, this time, their magic did not work. Disappointed and worried, they became panicky and sought the help of a Kuratti, the village [[astrologer]], to make them known the cause of these events.\n\nKuratti, hearing their woes, told them that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] had incarnated to eradicate the sufferings of all and therefore, they would do well to meet him to get rid of their woes. Coming to know of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the Malaiyaracar came to him immediately and pleaded with him to solve their problems. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] told them it was time for the destruction of all the evil forces and therefore, they would do well to surrender the knowledge of black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, and trickery, the spells used to bind others, and all types of esoteric charms in their possession. If refused to comply, they were warned of severe consequences. Hearing the admonition from [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], and fearing the consequences of the refusal to surrender, they agreed to hand over all their powers to him. Since they had not brought with them the manuscript documents that contained the spells, they vowed in front of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and the people that they would never again resort to these practices. When they did so, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] advised and blessed them to take to cultivation as an alternative profession. When this was done, the celestial Gods wrote it in the heavenly records that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] had done away with the evil forces and had made Dharmam to prosper in the world.\n\n=== Exhortations ===\n\nHaving incinerated the demons and seized the powers of the Malaiyaracar, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:\n\n:\"''From this day on, repose your faith only in [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], and fear not any other powers. Do not give offerings to temples, do not cast away your hard-earned money into dump-boxes, and keep your wealth to yourself.''\"\n\nListening to these exhortations, people of all castes realised that kalimayai was being destroyed and Dharmam was established. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] brought Dharmam also to the flora and fauna, exhorting them not to hurt or kill each other, and not to crush the weak, but to live in harmony as one family.\n \nPeople came as one family and listened to the exhortations of Dharmam given by [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. They accepted him in their hearts as the undisputed God and lived happily.\n\n=== Vaikundar's trial ===\n\nAt this time round, the king of [[Travancore|Thiruvithankur]], the Kalineesan came to [[Suchindrum]] for his routine visit. He was an agitated man. With his powers already been curtailed by the foreigners, he wanted to know whether there was any one else in his kingdom that could challenge his authority. The ministers told him as follows:\n\n:''\"From the race of the Chanar who perform the menial uliyam for us, someone, claiming to be the incarnation of [[Vishnu]], is making pronouncements that he is going to rule the land under his one undisputed command. He has gathered people of all castes into one place around him. He has also claimed that he would destroy all his enemies and establish a rule of Dharmam. It looks the Chanar people are having a great day\".''\n\nListening to this, the king grew weary. He summoned a seer to know whether the news was true. The seer confirmed it, saying it was time the great Vishnu incarnated as Vaikundar. The king retorted to the seer saying:\n\n\"''\"Even if the great Vishnu wanted to incarnate, would he, leaving aside the honourable Namboothiri and other Brahmin caste, come into this untouchable Chanar people? It looks to be a cheating\".''\n\nListening to the king, an elderly person from a shepherd caste, who was in the assembly, advised the king saying:\n\n\"''\"If Vishnu wants, he will take birth in any race and in any form. He may come as a [[Panan]] or a [[Pariah (people)|Pariyan]]. So better not to disturb this person\".''\n\nThe king was infuriated and was not ready to listen to anyone's counsel. He ordered one of the chiefs of the army to bring Vaikuntar to him. Accordingly, a squad of soldiers came and surrounded [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] who was sitting on a cot, performing his tavam. As the troops prepared to seize him, the Santror, standing near [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], got enraged and readied to attack the troops. Sensing trouble, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] prevented the Santror saying:\n\n:''\"My children, it is those who contain the instant rage that will become great. You are people of love. Keep restraint, I will make you rule the earth\".''\n\nThe army personnel, then, took hold of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], tied him with a rope, and tortured him ruthlessly. They questioned him with spite:\n\n:\"''\"Whether he became a deity for the Chanars? Whether he disguised himself as a deity in order to amass wealth?\"''\n\nHe was then led along the streets to the king. The wicked people threw stones at him, pulled his long hair and teased him, calling him demoniac. Some people from the low castes accused him of bringing disgrace to their race. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] did not utter a word in response. He reached Suchindram and was brought in front of the king.\n \nThe king wanted to test [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar's]] powers. He hid a ring in the palm of his hand and asked him to name it. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], being aware of the fact that showing his powers would not aid his mission in any way but that it would only precipitate matters unduly, remained reticent. The king, being hurt by his silence, ordered him to be tortured more. Five kinds of poison were mixed in an [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]] and given to him to drink. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] drank it as if he were drinking milk and remained unaffected. Seeing that the poison had not worked, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was confined in a stinking prison, infested with worms and leeches. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] took upon himself all these sufferings for the sake of his poor Chanar.\n\nThen Vaikundar was led through [[Kottar]], [[Chunkankadai]], [[Thuckalay]], [[Padmanabhapuram]], [[Balaramapuram]], and brought to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] where he was detained in an open prison. While in the prison, many people came and worshipped him.\n\nThe Kalineesan did not relent from torturing Vaikundar. He ordered him to be thrown to a starving [[tiger]]. In that, [[Ayya Vaikundar]] proves to the world, his Power (see [[Katuvai Sothanai]]).\n\nAfter that event, a person known as Poovandar went up to the king, and testifying to the genuineness of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], pleaded for his release. The king, considering the request, wanted Vaikundar to sign a document as a condition for the release. The condition was that he would not any more gather the different castes, except his own, into one place. Vaikundar tore the piece of material that contained the condition into pieces and threw it on to the ground. However, the king did not wish to retain him in the prison anymore.\n\nVaikundar chose the nineteenth of the Tamil month Masi (February/March) to be the day of his release. His devotees, the Santror, carried him on a cradle through Balaramapuram, [[Parvathipuram, Tamil Nadu|Parvathipuram]], Kottar, Suchindram and reached back to Thamaraippathi.\n\n=== Thuvayal Thavasu ===\n{{Main|Thuvayal Thavasu}}\n\nBack in [[Swamithoppe|Tamaraipathi]], [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] continued according to the instructions of his Father. He instructed the people to undertake a tavam called thuvayal thavam (''thuvay'' means ''to wash'') which was also called Thuvayal Thavasu, an act of [[ritual washing of one's physique and clothes]] along with practice of [[wiktionary:self-abnegation|self-abnegation]] and [[self-restraint]].\n\n=== Marriage with the Seven Virgins ===\n\nEven as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was continuing to instruct and serve the people, he intended to marry the seven virgins. He made some people of [[Chanar]], young and old, male and female, get into a trance and dance. He made some of them narrate the accounts of the world, and of the story of the seven virgins carrying the seeds of [[Krishna|Mayon]] and delivering the seven sons of the Chanar.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then, putting on the appearance of [[Narayana]], made the Santror, who stood around him, to walk in the four directions and call out to their mothers, the [[Seven Virgins]]. The seven divine mothers, listening to the call of their sons, came out and paid respect to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] who had come to marry them and give them back their children as it was promised to them in their previous birth.\n\nOnce the divine mothers came, after confirming their desire to get married and to get back their children, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] announced to the world the news of the marriage of the Seven Virgins with [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then asked the Santror what they would give as gift to the bridegroom. (see: [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]]).\n\nThe Santror, the kith and kin of the brides, answered that all their wealth, even their very lives could be given as gift to him. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then requested the Santror to take and give the hands of the seven virgins to him in marriage. When they did it ceremoniously, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] placed a glittering golden chain around the necks of the seven divine women.\n\nThe celestial saints then praised the special attributes of the marriage partners, and the race in which they hailed from. Then, singing the praises of [[Narayana]] and praying that he might fulfil his mission of ushering in the [[Dharma Yukam]], the brides and the bridegroom circumambulated the \u2018Pathi\u2019 in their ceremonial attire. The supplications of the brides were that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] should destroy the evil age, usher in the age of [[Dharma]], and make his people rule the Dharma Yukam .\n\nWhen the marriage had taken place as per the earlier promise, the Santror realised that all the curses incurred by them had been erased and there was no curse anymore on their race. People came from all directions to pay homage to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and presented him with various gifts.\n\n=== Festivals and celebrations ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] thought of organising festivals and celebrations with the people who garnered around him. He fixed Sunday, the day of his birth in the sea, to be the day in every week for celebrations. People gathered there on every Sunday, bringing him gifts. They decorated the vicinity with flowers and festoons. Amidst crackers of fireworks and music of joy, the seven virgins, dressing themselves in [[saffron]] and sporting the [[Thirunamam|Namam]] (sacred symbol on the forehead), came in grand procession on the streets alone with Vaikundar. [[Ayya Vaikundar]], as a [[Pantaram]], had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on the body, tied a turf on his hair, and carried a cane. Besides his disciples, a large number of Santror came in procession along with him. Those who had participated in the thuvayal thavam also accompanied him by chanting the prayer, \"Siva Siva\" Those men and women, that were \u2018taken hold of by divine power\u2019, sang the praises of [[Narayaya]] and accompanied the procession.\n\nDuring the procession, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was carried in a golden cradle. A conch shell was blown, womenfolk made [[kuravai]], and the celestial gods were showering flowers from above. People held these festivals in high esteem.\n\n=== Vaikundar as the Reigning King ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], being instructed through a dream that occurred to one of his followers, came to [[Moolakuntappati]] ([[Ambalappathi]]) with his kith and kin. Here he enthroned himself like a reigning king on a grand seat in a mansion built with pearls, designed with a pedestal for conducting the [[Ukattheerppu]] (the judgment). He vested himself in white silk, wore a golden cap on the head, and arbitrated for the people. People celebrated his presence there.\n\n=== Marriage with the Deities ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then decided to marry deities such as [[Pakavathi]] (Bhagavati), [[Valli]], [[Theivanai]], [[Mantaikattal]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Parvathi]] and [[Poomadanthai]]. He took on different forms and told the deities that they were to be united with him in order to destroy [[Kali Yukam]] and establish the [[Dharma Yukam]]. Then, compelling each deity to seduce a woman in the gathering, he married them in a grand manner.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], having married these deities, continued his activities among his people. People flocked to him in large numbers. They were pleased to invite him to their houses. They took him in chariots, arranged grand feasts in his honour, and presented him with very valuable gifts. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] laid the foundation for [[Nizhal Thangals]] in some villages that he visited.\n\n=== Ascending to Vaikundam, the abode of Thirumal ===\n\nHaving accomplished whatever he intended doing, Vaikundar thought of attaining Vaikundam, i.e., leaving this world and going to the world of [[Vaikundam]]. He prayed to [[Thirumal]] to take him back as he had accomplished his mission. Thirumal, too, had thought of calling his son back, and so he commanded his sages to decorate the house for his son in Vaikundam.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then began contemplating on Vaikundam alone. As he was preparing, he instructed his [[Santror]] not to be afraid, and to live united in love. He gave them a white mark on their forehead. Then he began his journey to Vaikundam on 1126, Itabam 21, at noon. As he reached Vaikundam, Thirumal and [[Isvaran]] received him warmly. The [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s praised him for his singular, unsurpassable achievement of the [[tavam]] that he had undertaken for the sake of destroying the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]].\n\nWhen he was received in the celestial abode, his women and children on earth interned his [[golden body]], erected a temple and conducted celebrations regularly.\n\n=== Dharma Yukam [The final victory] ===\n{{Main|Dharma Yukam}}\nIn Vaikundam, Thirumal asked his son whether he had fulfilled, without any flaw, all that had been told to him earlier. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], in response, told him about the six-year tavam and other activities. The sages who had been sent to accompany him vouched for the flawlessness of the tavam he undertook. \n \nBeing satisfied at the performance of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], Thirumal and Isvaran crowned him gloriously, gave him a sceptre and other divine paraphernalia, and seated him on the throne. While on the throne in Vaikundam, he was worshipped by his people on earth. All those who stood by him and served him when he undertook the tavam were granted happiness on earth, besides the assurance of a life with him in Vaikundam. Those [[Neesakulam]] that opposed and tortured him were condemned to [[hell]].\n\nOnce [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was crowned as the king, everything belonging to [[Dharma Yukam]] appeared as per the wish of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. People worthy of Dharma Yukam, including his children and women, appeared instantly. A whole lot of new creatures, animals, plants and trees appeared. A new earth, new moon, new sky, new wind, etc. emerged. The wicked people disappeared and the people, worthy of Dharma Yukam, appeared. All those living beings, that had been ordered to come up at the coronation of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], awoke to the new age. All those unworthy of Dharma Yukam were engulfed by the sea.\n\nThen, Thirumal brought up the life of [[Kroni]] for judgment.\n\nThirumal interrogated him as follows:\n\n:''\"I had come as a [[Pantaram]] in the [[kaliyukam]] and had burned the [[demons]], healed the people with water, solicited [[Dharmam]], prevented offerings, and gathered the people in one place and taught them. You caught me and tortured me cruelly due to your wickedness. You did these things, contrary to your own promise given me earlier that you wouldn\u2019t torture any Pantaram. You have violated your promise, and therefore, you yourself have brought ruins upon you. Have you any response to this?\"''\n\n[[Kalineesan]], then, without having anything to say, surrendered all his powers and boons. The force of illusion took hold of him and put him into the flames of the abyss where the devils resided. All the evil forces of the [[kalimayai]] were also destroyed likewise. And then, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] blew a [[conch shell]] to announce his victory.\n \nHearing the sound of the conch-shell, all that befitted Dharma Yukam - the virtues, the [[Shastra|Sastirankal]], the plants and trees, the reptiles and the birds, the divine women and their children - all gathered around [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. He gave them blessings, and instructed them to live fearlessly. He enjoined upon them to assemble in one place, to drink from the same well, and live happily as per the values of Dharma Yukam.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of Ayyavazhi-related articles]]\n*[[Hindu mythology]]\n*[[Ayya Vaikundar]]\n*[[Ayyavazhi Trinity]]\n*[[Ayyavazhi]]\n*[[Hinduism]]\n*[[Hindu reform movements]]\n*[[Hindu Renaissance]]\n* www.marunthuvazhmalai.com - Marutwa mala Hills, marunthuva malai, marunthuvazh malai]\n\n==References==\n\n* T.

The main source of Ayyavazhi mythology is the Ayyavazhi [[scripture]], [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]], and its supplement, [[Arul Nool]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian religions: tradition, history and culture |page=123|first=Dr. Preeti |last=Tripathy|year=2010|publisher=Axis Publications}}</ref> The [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]] is a recitation by ''[[Thirumal|Mayon]]'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for [[Vishnu]], or [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) to his consort [[Lakshmi]]. It is divided into three sections: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Early Avatars|Early Avatars]], [[#Incarnational events|incarnational events]] and [[#Post-incarnational events|post-incarnational events]].\n\n== Early Avatars ==\nThe early avatars are all those that occurred prior to the earthly incarnation of [[Vishnu|Mayon]].\n\n=== The first six Yugas ===\n\nThe first ''[[Yuga]]'' (\"aeon\" or \"era\") was called Neetiya Yuga.  During this time, divine, human and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. They did not fear [[demon]]s, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Universe, as well as among those who lived in the [[Fourteen Worlds]]. In this yuga, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means.\n\nDuring this peaceful time, [[Kroni]] was born. Kroni, who is analogous to [[Satan]] in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, is a primordial personification of [[evil]]. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yugas: as [[Ravana]] or [[Duryodhana]], for example. Likewise, Mayon also incarnates in different yugas as different ''[[Avatar]]s'': for example [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]].\n\nIn order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed ''[[Kailayam]]'', the abode of ''Sivan'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for [[Shiva]]), and then proceeded to devour the entire universe. [[Akilam one]]: 440-446. ([[oldwikisource:\u0ba8\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf \u0baf\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bae|text available at Wikisource]])\n\n[[Krishna|Mayon]], residing with [[Shiva|Sivan]] in ''Kailayam'', escaped to undertake ''[[tavam]]'' (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'', meaning \"austerity\") and to receive permission from Sivan to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six yukams in order to destroy the [[Six Fragments]] of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments and saved the universe. The first yuga thus came to an end.\n\nIn the second yuga, called ''[[Chathura Yukam|Chathura Yuga]]'', one of the six pieces of Kroni was formed into a creature named [[Kuntomasali]].  It had the shape and size of a mammoth [[leech]], and when it disturbed the tavam of those in [[Tava lokam]] (the land of austerity), Mayon destroyed the leech by catching it with a hook.\n\nIn the third yuga, called [[Netu Yukam|Netu Yuga]], another fragment of Kroni created two wicked individuals called [[Thillaimallalan]] and [[Mallosivahanan]]. They ruled over the people by extracting ''Uliyam'' and ''Iraikal'' ([[taxes]]) from them. When this exploitation became unbearable, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (celestial beings) complained to Sivan, who, in turn, commissioned Mayon to carry out the destruction of the wicked rulers, which he did.\n\nThe fourth yuga was called [[Kretha Yukam|Kretha Yuga]]. The third fragment of [[Kroni]] was, again, made into two siblings, called [[Suraparppan]] and [[Sinhamuka Asuran]], and they were given responsibility to rule the Earth. The wicked rulers began to crush the Devas, who reported it to Mayon. Mayon took the form of [[Kartikeya|Arumugan]], the Tamil name for [[Kartikeya]], and advised the rulers to desist from their wickedness. However, when they arrogantly spurned his advice, Arumugan eliminated them. During the same [[Yuga]], Suraparppan was created, this time as [[Hiranyakashipu|Iraniyan]]. Mayon, incarnated as the son of Iraniyan ([[Prahlada]]), challenged his authority and finally took on the [[therianthropic]] form of man and lion ([[Narasimha]]) by piercing his stomach. On his deathbed, Mayon asked him to repent, but he replied arrogantly: \"You cannot kill me. Only by placing ten mountains as ten nails might you kill me. Otherwise you can't.\"\n\nIn the ensuing yuga, called [[Thretha Yukam|Thretha Yuga]], Sivan, as per the request of Mayon, created the fourth piece of the primordial Kroni as a [[ten-headed mighty warrior]], with the ten mountains as ten heads, naming him as [[Ravana]]n. He oppressed all those living on Earth by extracting Uliyam from them. He subdued all the earthly kings and made them pay tributes to him. Suffering under his oppression, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] sought the help of Mayon who, for the purpose of destroying him, took birth as [[Rama]]n. On his death-bed, he repented, saying: \"Only with the help of my brother were you able to destroy me.\" With this episode of killing Ravanan, Thretha Yuga came to an end.\n\nIn the sixth [[yuga]], called [[Dwapara Yukam|Dwapara Yuga]], the fifth fragment of Kroni was portioned into a hundred pieces, and made into [[Duryodhana|Duriyodhanan]] and [[ninety-nine brothers]] to support him. The [[three brothers of Raman]], along with [[Vibushanan]]  and [[Sampoovan]] of the preceding epoch, were created as [[Pandava|Pancha Pandavas]] in this aeon. The wicked Duriyodhanan was killed by the Pancha Pandavas, with the support of Mayon, who came in the form of [[Krishna]]. Even at the brink of death, Duriyodhanan refused to repent, saying that \"only with your cunning mind were you able to defeat me, and otherwise not.\" Mayon then told him: \"You will be created with [[knowledge]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], and [[artist]]ic skill in the next Yukam, and if you do not repent in that age, that will be your eternal annihilation.\" Having said this, Mayon went to [[Srirangam]] and dwelt there.\n\n=== The Santror ===\n{{Main|The Santror}}\nTowards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], [[Thirumal]] (Mayon), with the aid of Seven Virgins ([[Saptha Kanniyar]]), had begotten seven sons, known as the [[Santror Makkal]] (see [[Santror Pirappu]]), in order to accomplish the task of destroying the [[Kalineesan]] and [[Kali mayai]] ([[Kali Yuga]] [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]]) that were to be countered in the following [[Kali Yuga]].\n\nAfter the birth of Santror, they were all named by conducting a naming ceremony (see [[The Naming ceremony of Santror]]) and fed with celestial nectar (see [[Feeding the children with Celestial Nectar]]). The Santror were raised by Bhadrakali and married to the daughters of Nirupathirajan (see [[Fostered by the acclaimed Deity Patrakali]]).\n\n=== Kalineesan, Kali Yuga, and Kalimayai ===\n{{main|Kaliyan}}\n\nThe sixth fragment of the primordial [[Kroni]] was [[Neesan]], the epitome of wickedness ((Tamil ''neesa'' meaning \"wickedness\"). Neesan was created in the form of a male [[human being]] who was wise, beautiful and intelligent. Neesan pushed himself out of the earth in an inverted form. Upon seeing his appearance, the celestial diviners predicted that he, being without normal human parentage, would have an undefined and rude physique, and that his intelligence and five senses would be rooted in falsehood. They further predicted that he would have a life as fragile as that of a bird, but he would unleash wickedness on people with arrogance.\n\nHaving obtained innumerable boons (see [[Boons claimed by Kaliyan|Boons]]), including the [[Chakra]] of Mayon and invincibility, Neesan proceeded to earth to rule over the people. On his way, he was accosted by [[Thirumal]], who appeared as a [[Pantaram]] (an [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] [[mendicant]]), with long flowing unkempt hair and torn clothes. Thirumal challenged him to a duel which Neesan refused, considering it beneath his dignity to fight with a Pantaram coming in such an attire without any weapon. Taking the opportune moment, Thirumal shrewdly made Neesan promise to forfeit all his boons if any of his lies caused trouble to any Pantaram on earth in the future.  Then, he bought the Chakra from Kaliyan and cursed it as money. The money asked Thirumal when this curse would leave it, to which Thirumal replied: \"It will leave you when Kali is defeated\".\n\nThe Neesan was thenceforth called [[Kalineesan]] because the [[Kali Yuga]] had dawned along with his birth. Along with him was born an evil force called [[Kali Mayai]] (Kali Yuga [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]]). The ''Kali'' here refers to the evil spirit behind ''Kali Yuga'' and not ''[[Kali]]'', the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity).\n\n[[Kali (demon)|Kali]] Maya engulfed the whole world and consequently, deceit and illusion began to contaminate the minds of the people. Age-old traditions and conventions, based on [[Dharma]]m, were unduly overthrown. Kalineesan introduced the discrimination of [[caste]] among the people. The powerless people were crushed with brute might. People, caught in the Kalimayai, began to be inimical towards one another - men against women, children against parents, and so forth. People used demonic force to harm one another. Kalimayai captured the king of [[Thiruvitankur]] and began to rule over the people as their king.\n\n=== Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram ===\n\n{{main|Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram}}\n\nThirumal, dwelling at [[Sri Rangam]] hitherto, found it unworthy of his abode because of the misdeeds of the priests there. He shifted his tent to [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. When he reached there, a [[Pulayar]] woman saw him and spread the news to one and all. Hearing of this, Kalineesan constructed a temple of fine granite at the site where the Pulayar woman spotted Tirumal, and decorated the temple with gold and pearls. The king instituted scores of rituals and ceremonies at the temple to be performed by [[Namboothiri]] [[Brahmins]]. The lights of the temple were, however, lit daily from a torch brought from the home of the Pulayar woman.\n\n==== Venneesan ====\n\n{{main|Venneesan}}\n\n[[Kalineesan]] had no children, so he went on a pilgrimage to [[Kingdom of Kashi|Kasi]], a holy place, and stood in ''[[tavam]]'' (spiritual suffering) for a son. While performing the ''tavam'', he was distracted by the scene of a cleric embracing a woman. Because of this, [[Kalineesan|Kalineesan's]] [[semen]] came out and fell into the water. A white crane came and swallowed the semen, became pregnant, and delivered a baby boy in the water. A sage, [[Punal Rhishi]], took the baby, which was white in appearance, and looked after it.\n\nKalineesan, his ''tavam'' being defective, returned to his country in despair, resigned to a prediction that even if he were to have a son, it would be only the sons of his sister who would rule the country.\n\nThe baby, delivered by the white crane, grew up and came of age, and was married in the land of [[Chenkomatti]]. He prospered there with his progeny, who later emerged as a powerful people by learning the skills of ship-travel, trading in gold and silver, and diplomacy. This people, called Venneesa kulam, propagated a religion of their own, and through the lure of money gained many new members. Venneesan (the name comes from two words, ''venmai'' meaning \"white,\" and ''neesan,'' meaning \"wicked person\") introduced a new calendar.\n\n==== Santror in Kali Yuga ====\n\nKalineesan, coming to know about the valour and loyalty of the Santror people, appointed them as his bodyguards. It so happened that one day, while guarding the entrance of the king\u2019s room, the body-guards happened to fall asleep, during which time, the enemies of the king, hailing from the king\u2019s own race, entered the room and assassinated the king. The Kalineesan, while succumbing to the murderous attack, mistaking it to be a betrayal by the body-guards, cursed them that they and their progeny would be oppressed with oozhiyam ([[coolie]] service) and [[regressive taxation]] as long as the king\u2019s dynasty ruled the country.\n \nThe curse of the king began to take effect on the Santror. The Kalineesan, the successor of the previous king, imposed innumerable taxes on every article used by the Santror for their day to day living. Their occupational implements, the [[Arecaceae|palmyra trees]] that supported them, and every item of the produce of these trees were punitively taxed. The produce of the palmyra trees was to be given to the high castes, failing which the Santror were tortured with [[corporal punishment]]s. There were many arbitrary taxes imposed on them. The Santror found no favour with the rules, in spite of paying these cruel taxes.\n\n==== Thirumal deserting Kalineesan ====\n\nHaving witnessed the woes of the Santror, Mayon admonished the king to desist from oppressing them. He reminded the king that it was his seventh birth, coming in the lineage of the primordial Kroni, and if he failed to repent during this opportunity, then it would be his eternal damnation. He exhorted him to revoke the cruel taxes and the exploitative system of uliyam, imposed on the Santror, the people born of Mayon's seeds.\n\nThe king retorted, saying:\n:\"How dare you advise me to revoke the taxes and the oozhiyam imposed on the low caste [[Chanar]]? If I do so, how else do I earn gold coins - a hundred of them needed to perform puja for you every morning and evening, a thousand of them needed to take care of all the temples and me, and a ten thousand of them needed to pay my staff? Do I not get these gold coins by squeezing the labour of these Chanar? Even if you desert me and go to one of the Chanar places, I will never revoke the taxes and oozhiyam imposed on them.\"\n\nResponding to the king, Mayon said:\n:\"Did I ever ask you to offer me [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] by exploiting the people? You offer puja not to me, but to the Namboothiri Brahmins. The whole world knows that the only thing that I receive whole-heartedly is the light brought by the [[Pulayar]] woman.\"\n \nPeeved at the response of Mayon, the king mockingly said: \"If you have not tasted any of my offerings, what then have you to do with me? Go wherever you want to...\" Listening to the impenitent and brute words of the king, divine rage overcame Mayon and he said: \"You have mocked at me and ill-treated me as you do to the Chanar. Lo, I am going away from your place to [[Thiruchendur]]. I will take on you in another form. Then, I will perform a [[Dharma]]m that you and the world will acknowledge as the greatest. I will destroy the pervasive demonic cult and crown the Chanar\".\n\nHaving said these things, Mayon deserted [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. He told the people: \"Henceforth, let all castes united as one people, come to the place where I am going to dwell\". Having said this, he proceeded to Thiruchendur. It happened then that the fortress of the Kalineesan crashed into pieces. The earth was covered with darkness of slumber, the sea engulfed the land, and all the palatial buildings of the king were effaced.  Seeing these calamities, the Brahmins lamented and the priests wailed.\n \nMayon took his abode at the seashore of Thiruchendur. During this time, the venneesan had spread his wicked rule over the country, trampling upon the traditions of the land. He flouted the principles of ''Dharma'', observed by the Santror and failed to give the dignity due to them.\n\n== Incarnational events ==\n\nIncarnational events include preparations for incarnation, the event of incarnation, and the proclamations and instructions given to the newly incarnated god. Since [[Vishnu|Mayon's]] incarnation, as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Lord Vaikundar]], is the foremost power, this is considered to be the most important part in [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]]. Below is an elaboration of these events.\n\n=== Preparing for incarnation ===\n\nSeeing the degraded status of the Santror, the celestial gods made a plea to [[Vishnu|Mayon]] as follows: \"Our young brothers, the Santror, are suffering endlessly under the yoke of the centuries old oozhiyam and have lost dignity and respect on account of that. Have you not seen their iniquities?\" \n \nAfter listening to the plea, [[Vishnu|Mayon]] prepared for the incarnation. He made all the celestial gods take birth in the world in order to assist in destroying the kali. He set out to create new [[cattle]], [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[plant]]s, [[tree]]s, and all other elements of nature that would befit the new age of [[Dharma Yukam]] because the Dharma Yukam was to be characterised by a new life, new people, and new thinking. In that new age [[Shastra]]s, [[Veda]]s and all the religions would be the same; the Tamil language would permeate the world; people would live united as a single humanity; the people of Mayon would live with pristine glory and they would flourish with all prosperity; the earth would yield abundantly; diseases, calamities and the impact of the evil magical practices would not affect the people; the old Shastras would be turned untrue, and instead, a new code would be enshrined.\n\n=== Mayon &mdash; on the identity of his people ===\n\nMayon then enunciated the attributes of his children who would be his collaborators in the world. He said:\n\n:\"The identity of my people is that they do not offer puja or sacrifices, do not have temples and priests, do not have offerings of flowers, do not offer [[blood sacrifice]]s of goat, bull and [[rooster]]s, and do not worship cows and images made of clay. Instead, they are those who do [[Dharma]]m to all those who come in my name.\"\n\n=== Final admonition through Thiruvasakam ===\n\nBefore the incarnation of Mayon could take place, the [[Trimurti|three godheads]] decided to send a final admonition with the name of Thiruvasakam to [[Kali (demon)|Kalineesan]] that he might amend''. (see : [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)]])''\n\n=== Deciding to incarnate as Vaikundar ===\n\n{{main|Vishnu}}\n\n[[Kali (demon)|Kalineesan]] did not pay heed to the Thiruvasakam. [[Vishnu|Mayon]] then decided to incarnate as Vaikundar and, to that effect, walked towards the seashore of Thiruchendur. \n \nWhen the day came, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] then instantly went into the sea, amidst the chanting of the celestial gods. Inside the sea, enveloping himself in a scorching flame, he approached [[Lakshmi]] who was awaiting his arrival in the form of a Lotus pedestal. Afraid of the ball of flame approaching her, [[Lakshmi]] worshipped it with reverence. Mayon revealed himself and took Lakshmi and told her of his intention to create a son. By that time, [[Vishnu|Mayon]] had come into the sea. Then, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity Goddess Lakshmi, he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of Tiruchendur on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday).\n\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of Akilattirattu Ammanai with the grace of God!\n\n\u201c \u2018O\u2019 Lord you took avatar for Pandavas and eliminated their enemies. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of Kaliyan. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma\u201d \n\n\u201cOn Masi 1008, I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar\u201d \u2013 Akilattirattu\n\nAkilattirattu says, Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I (Lord Narayana) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 Akilattirattu[[File:The ref.Ayya.png|thumb|130px|right|Incarnation of Lord Vaikundar]]\nHe then imparted certain arcane knowledge in the form of proclamations and instructions, known as [[Vinchai]], to his newly niall son, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. ''(see: [[Vinchai to Vaikundar]])''\n\nHaving given these exhortations, Mayon called his son intimately as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Narayana Vaikundar]] and told him that if these teachings were observed strictly, the illusory force of kali would be contained and when people learned to live with [[self-respect]], [[Kali]] would destroy itself.\n\nThen the whole array of celestial gods sang lullabies (See:[[Thalattu]], [[Palli Unarthal]], [[Abayam]].), praising the special attributes of the newly born child, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. They praised him for having been born as the child of Mayon, in the race of Chanar, in order to teach the virtue of Dharmam to the world and to incinerate [[Kali]].\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Lord Vaikundar]], having received all the instructions from his father, walked out of the sea to go into the world. Mayon sent two celestial sages (Kalai Muni and Gnana Muni) with him as witnesses to his activities. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\n== Post-incarnational events ==\n\n{{Main|Ayya Vaikundar}}\n\nThe various episodes, that are portrayed to be occurring after the event of incarnation, are called here as post-incarnational events. Given below is an elaboration of them.\n\n=== Vaikundar's emergence out of the sea ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] crossed over to the land from the sea and showing a human appearance as Narayana Pantaram to the mother of [[Sampooranathevan|Muthukutty (alias Sampoornadevan)]], told her: \"Woman, you had been [[Sampooranathevan|Muthukutty]] mother before the year 1008 (AD 1833). I (Narayana) have been born as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the child of Mayon. I have received powers for redeeming the Santror. I am going to destroy the evilmongers and rule the world under a single command.\" Having said this, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] set out towards [[Detchanam]] (Dakshin, the south).\n\n=== Vaikundar's journey to Detchanam ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] walked towards Detchanam, along the sea route. All along his path, the creatures of the sea and the animals of the forest greeted him, expressing their happiness, for they were to be freed from the clutches of Kali. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], announcing the glad tidings to everyone, traversed the path towards [[Manavaippathi]] ([[Puvantantoppu]]) in Detchanam. The itinerant [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], reaching the temple of [[Pakavathi]] at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], told her that he, the [[Ayya Vaikundar|Narayana Vaikundar]], had come to uplift the lowly by ruling the world under the banner of Dharmam and therefore, she was to rescind from accepting any sacrifices or offerings.\n\n=== Tavam ===\n{{main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}\n\nMaking himself known to the people as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the great [[Narayana]] took his abode under a tree at the entrance of Manavaippathi.\n\n=== Burning of the demons ===\n\nWhen a year and a half had passed after undertaking the Tavam, people complained to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] of the disturbances caused by the demons in the world. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], intending to put an end to the misdeeds of the demons, thought of incinerating them totally. He then summoned a celestial sage and sought his counsel on this matter. The sage, after going through the [[Akamankal]] ([[Hindu Agamas|Agamas]]), told [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]:\n\n:''From the moment [[Narayana]] became [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and came to the world, the demons, the evil spirits and all other deceptions of the world are disappearing; [[Kali]] Yukam is being destroyed, together with the old [[Veda]]s. [[Purana]]s and [[Hindu Agamas|Agamas]] have lost their substance. As of now, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] is establishing a Dharma Yukam that he will rule eternally. So, now is the right time to destroy all that are to be destroyed.''\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then assembled all the demons in one place. He made some persons in the gathering, who were accustomed to \u2018possession\u2019, to get \u2018possessed\u2019 of the demons in the presence of the people. The demons that had \u2018come on to these persons\u2019 began to tremble with fear and, by making loud cries, bemoaned their end. Resigned to their fate, they requested [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] to tell them the modalities to surrender. When the demons asked it themselves, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] ordered them to make an oath in front of the people that they had surrendered all their powers. Accordingly, the demons made a public oath that they had surrendered all their powers. Then they fled to the mountain and killed themselves by falling into fire. As this happened, those that were dancing due to the \u2018possession\u2019 of the demons got exhausted and fell flat on the grounds. As the crowd was witnessing all these happenings, a few shepherds, tending their flock in the mountain, came rushing and reported that they heard the loud cries of the demons as they were falling in the fire. When the crowd heard these, they appreciated the way the demons were destroyed and acknowledged that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was really the Narayanar needed for the country.\n\n=== Seizing the power of magic, witchcraft, sorcery, trickery, etc. ===\n\nHaving destroyed the demons, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] thought of incarcerating the powers of [[Malaiyarasar]], the people of the mountain who performed [[black magic]], [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], etc., with the aid of [[evil spirits]]. No sooner had he thought of it than the [[wild animal]]s, being released from the clutches of the Malaiyaracar, went berserk and attacked the people ferociously. Horrified at the behaviour of the animals, the Malaiyaracar resorted to their usual black magic to contain the animals. But, alas, this time, their magic did not work. Disappointed and worried, they became panicky and sought the help of a Kuratti, the village [[astrologer]], to make them known the cause of these events.\n\nKuratti, hearing their woes, told them that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] had incarnated to eradicate the sufferings of all and therefore, they would do well to meet him to get rid of their woes. Coming to know of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], the Malaiyaracar came to him immediately and pleaded with him to solve their problems. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] told them it was time for the destruction of all the evil forces and therefore, they would do well to surrender the knowledge of black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, and trickery, the spells used to bind others, and all types of esoteric charms in their possession. If refused to comply, they were warned of severe consequences. Hearing the admonition from [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], and fearing the consequences of the refusal to surrender, they agreed to hand over all their powers to him. Since they had not brought with them the manuscript documents that contained the spells, they vowed in front of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and the people that they would never again resort to these practices. When they did so, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] advised and blessed them to take to cultivation as an alternative profession. When this was done, the celestial Gods wrote it in the heavenly records that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] had done away with the evil forces and had made Dharmam to prosper in the world.\n\n=== Exhortations ===\n\nHaving incinerated the demons and seized the powers of the Malaiyaracar, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:\n\n:\"''From this day on, repose your faith only in [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], and fear not any other powers. Do not give offerings to temples, do not cast away your hard-earned money into dump-boxes, and keep your wealth to yourself.''\"\n\nListening to these exhortations, people of all castes realised that kalimayai was being destroyed and Dharmam was established. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] brought Dharmam also to the flora and fauna, exhorting them not to hurt or kill each other, and not to crush the weak, but to live in harmony as one family.\n \nPeople came as one family and listened to the exhortations of Dharmam given by [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. They accepted him in their hearts as the undisputed God and lived happily.\n\n=== Vaikundar's trial ===\n\nAt this time round, the king of [[Travancore|Thiruvithankur]], the Kalineesan came to [[Suchindrum]] for his routine visit. He was an agitated man. With his powers already been curtailed by the foreigners, he wanted to know whether there was any one else in his kingdom that could challenge his authority. The ministers told him as follows:\n\n:''\"From the race of the Chanar who perform the menial uliyam for us, someone, claiming to be the incarnation of [[Vishnu]], is making pronouncements that he is going to rule the land under his one undisputed command. He has gathered people of all castes into one place around him. He has also claimed that he would destroy all his enemies and establish a rule of Dharmam. It looks the Chanar people are having a great day\".''\n\nListening to this, the king grew weary. He summoned a seer to know whether the news was true. The seer confirmed it, saying it was time the great Vishnu incarnated as Vaikundar. The king retorted to the seer saying:\n\n\"''\"Even if the great Vishnu wanted to incarnate, would he, leaving aside the honourable Namboothiri and other Brahmin caste, come into this untouchable Chanar people? It looks to be a cheating\".''\n\nListening to the king, an elderly person from a shepherd caste, who was in the assembly, advised the king saying:\n\n\"''\"If Vishnu wants, he will take birth in any race and in any form. He may come as a [[Panan]] or a [[Pariah (people)|Pariyan]]. So better not to disturb this person\".''\n\nThe king was infuriated and was not ready to listen to anyone's counsel. He ordered one of the chiefs of the army to bring Vaikuntar to him. Accordingly, a squad of soldiers came and surrounded [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] who was sitting on a cot, performing his tavam. As the troops prepared to seize him, the Santror, standing near [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], got enraged and readied to attack the troops. Sensing trouble, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] prevented the Santror saying:\n\n:''\"My children, it is those who contain the instant rage that will become great. You are people of love. Keep restraint, I will make you rule the earth\".''\n\nThe army personnel, then, took hold of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], tied him with a rope, and tortured him ruthlessly. They questioned him with spite:\n\n:\"''\"Whether he became a deity for the Chanars? Whether he disguised himself as a deity in order to amass wealth?\"''\n\nHe was then led along the streets to the king. The wicked people threw stones at him, pulled his long hair and teased him, calling him demoniac. Some people from the low castes accused him of bringing disgrace to their race. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] did not utter a word in response. He reached Suchindram and was brought in front of the king.\n \nThe king wanted to test [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar's]] powers. He hid a ring in the palm of his hand and asked him to name it. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], being aware of the fact that showing his powers would not aid his mission in any way but that it would only precipitate matters unduly, remained reticent. The king, being hurt by his silence, ordered him to be tortured more. Five kinds of poison were mixed in an [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]] and given to him to drink. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] drank it as if he were drinking milk and remained unaffected. Seeing that the poison had not worked, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was confined in a stinking prison, infested with worms and leeches. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] took upon himself all these sufferings for the sake of his poor Chanar.\n\nThen Vaikundar was led through [[Kottar]], [[Chunkankadai]], [[Thuckalay]], [[Padmanabhapuram]], [[Balaramapuram]], and brought to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] where he was detained in an open prison. While in the prison, many people came and worshipped him.\n\nThe Kalineesan did not relent from torturing Vaikundar. He ordered him to be thrown to a starving [[tiger]]. In that, [[Ayya Vaikundar]] proves to the world, his Power (see [[Katuvai Sothanai]]).\n\nAfter that event, a person known as Poovandar went up to the king, and testifying to the genuineness of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], pleaded for his release. The king, considering the request, wanted Vaikundar to sign a document as a condition for the release. The condition was that he would not any more gather the different castes, except his own, into one place. Vaikundar tore the piece of material that contained the condition into pieces and threw it on to the ground. However, the king did not wish to retain him in the prison anymore.\n\nVaikundar chose the nineteenth of the Tamil month Masi (February/March) to be the day of his release. His devotees, the Santror, carried him on a cradle through Balaramapuram, [[Parvathipuram, Tamil Nadu|Parvathipuram]], Kottar, Suchindram and reached back to Thamaraippathi.\n\n=== Thuvayal Thavasu ===\n{{Main|Thuvayal Thavasu}}\n\nBack in [[Swamithoppe|Tamaraipathi]], [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] continued according to the instructions of his Father. He instructed the people to undertake a tavam called thuvayal thavam (''thuvay'' means ''to wash'') which was also called Thuvayal Thavasu, an act of [[ritual washing of one's physique and clothes]] along with practice of [[wiktionary:self-abnegation|self-abnegation]] and [[self-restraint]].\n\n=== Marriage with the Seven Virgins ===\n\nEven as [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was continuing to instruct and serve the people, he intended to marry the seven virgins. He made some people of [[Chanar]], young and old, male and female, get into a trance and dance. He made some of them narrate the accounts of the world, and of the story of the seven virgins carrying the seeds of [[Krishna|Mayon]] and delivering the seven sons of the Chanar.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then, putting on the appearance of [[Narayana]], made the Santror, who stood around him, to walk in the four directions and call out to their mothers, the [[Seven Virgins]]. The seven divine mothers, listening to the call of their sons, came out and paid respect to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] who had come to marry them and give them back their children as it was promised to them in their previous birth.\n\nOnce the divine mothers came, after confirming their desire to get married and to get back their children, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] announced to the world the news of the marriage of the Seven Virgins with [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then asked the Santror what they would give as gift to the bridegroom. (see: [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]]).\n\nThe Santror, the kith and kin of the brides, answered that all their wealth, even their very lives could be given as gift to him. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then requested the Santror to take and give the hands of the seven virgins to him in marriage. When they did it ceremoniously, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] placed a glittering golden chain around the necks of the seven divine women.\n\nThe celestial saints then praised the special attributes of the marriage partners, and the race in which they hailed from. Then, singing the praises of [[Narayana]] and praying that he might fulfil his mission of ushering in the [[Dharma Yukam]], the brides and the bridegroom circumambulated the \u2018Pathi\u2019 in their ceremonial attire. The supplications of the brides were that [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] should destroy the evil age, usher in the age of [[Dharma]], and make his people rule the Dharma Yukam .\n\nWhen the marriage had taken place as per the earlier promise, the Santror realised that all the curses incurred by them had been erased and there was no curse anymore on their race. People came from all directions to pay homage to [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] and presented him with various gifts.\n\n=== Festivals and celebrations ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] thought of organising festivals and celebrations with the people who garnered around him. He fixed Sunday, the day of his birth in the sea, to be the day in every week for celebrations. People gathered there on every Sunday, bringing him gifts. They decorated the vicinity with flowers and festoons. Amidst crackers of fireworks and music of joy, the seven virgins, dressing themselves in [[saffron]] and sporting the [[Thirunamam|Namam]] (sacred symbol on the forehead), came in grand procession on the streets alone with Vaikundar. [[Ayya Vaikundar]], as a [[Pantaram]], had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on the body, tied a turf on his hair, and carried a cane. Besides his disciples, a large number of Santror came in procession along with him. Those who had participated in the thuvayal thavam also accompanied him by chanting the prayer, \"Siva Siva\" Those men and women, that were \u2018taken hold of by divine power\u2019, sang the praises of [[Narayaya]] and accompanied the procession.\n\nDuring the procession, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was carried in a golden cradle. A conch shell was blown, womenfolk made [[kuravai]], and the celestial gods were showering flowers from above. People held these festivals in high esteem.\n\n=== Vaikundar as the Reigning King ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], being instructed through a dream that occurred to one of his followers, came to [[Moolakuntappati]] ([[Ambalappathi]]) with his kith and kin. Here he enthroned himself like a reigning king on a grand seat in a mansion built with pearls, designed with a pedestal for conducting the [[Ukattheerppu]] (the judgment). He vested himself in white silk, wore a golden cap on the head, and arbitrated for the people. People celebrated his presence there.\n\n=== Marriage with the Deities ===\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then decided to marry deities such as [[Pakavathi]] (Bhagavati), [[Valli]], [[Theivanai]], [[Mantaikattal]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Parvathi]] and [[Poomadanthai]]. He took on different forms and told the deities that they were to be united with him in order to destroy [[Kali Yukam]] and establish the [[Dharma Yukam]]. Then, compelling each deity to seduce a woman in the gathering, he married them in a grand manner.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], having married these deities, continued his activities among his people. People flocked to him in large numbers. They were pleased to invite him to their houses. They took him in chariots, arranged grand feasts in his honour, and presented him with very valuable gifts. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] laid the foundation for [[Nizhal Thangals]] in some villages that he visited.\n\n=== Ascending to Vaikundam, the abode of Thirumal ===\n\nHaving accomplished whatever he intended doing, Vaikundar thought of attaining Vaikundam, i.e., leaving this world and going to the world of [[Vaikundam]]. He prayed to [[Thirumal]] to take him back as he had accomplished his mission. Thirumal, too, had thought of calling his son back, and so he commanded his sages to decorate the house for his son in Vaikundam.\n\n[[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] then began contemplating on Vaikundam alone. As he was preparing, he instructed his [[Santror]] not to be afraid, and to live united in love. He gave them a white mark on their forehead. Then he began his journey to Vaikundam on 1126, Itabam 21, at noon. As he reached Vaikundam, Thirumal and [[Isvaran]] received him warmly. The [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s praised him for his singular, unsurpassable achievement of the [[tavam]] that he had undertaken for the sake of destroying the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]].\n\nWhen he was received in the celestial abode, his women and children on earth interned his [[golden body]], erected a temple and conducted celebrations regularly.\n\n=== Dharma Yukam [The final victory] ===\n{{Main|Dharma Yukam}}\nIn Vaikundam, Thirumal asked his son whether he had fulfilled, without any flaw, all that had been told to him earlier. [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], in response, told him about the six-year tavam and other activities. The sages who had been sent to accompany him vouched for the flawlessness of the tavam he undertook. \n \nBeing satisfied at the performance of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], Thirumal and Isvaran crowned him gloriously, gave him a sceptre and other divine paraphernalia, and seated him on the throne. While on the throne in Vaikundam, he was worshipped by his people on earth. All those who stood by him and served him when he undertook the tavam were granted happiness on earth, besides the assurance of a life with him in Vaikundam. Those [[Neesakulam]] that opposed and tortured him were condemned to [[hell]].\n\nOnce [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] was crowned as the king, everything belonging to [[Dharma Yukam]] appeared as per the wish of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. People worthy of Dharma Yukam, including his children and women, appeared instantly. A whole lot of new creatures, animals, plants and trees appeared. A new earth, new moon, new sky, new wind, etc. emerged. The wicked people disappeared and the people, worthy of Dharma Yukam, appeared. All those living beings, that had been ordered to come up at the coronation of [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]], awoke to the new age. All those unworthy of Dharma Yukam were engulfed by the sea.\n\nThen, Thirumal brought up the life of [[Kroni]] for judgment.\n\nThirumal interrogated him as follows:\n\n:''\"I had come as a [[Pantaram]] in the [[kaliyukam]] and had burned the [[demons]], healed the people with water, solicited [[Dharmam]], prevented offerings, and gathered the people in one place and taught them. You caught me and tortured me cruelly due to your wickedness. You did these things, contrary to your own promise given me earlier that you wouldn\u2019t torture any Pantaram. You have violated your promise, and therefore, you yourself have brought ruins upon you. Have you any response to this?\"''\n\n[[Kalineesan]], then, without having anything to say, surrendered all his powers and boons. The force of illusion took hold of him and put him into the flames of the abyss where the devils resided. All the evil forces of the [[kalimayai]] were also destroyed likewise. And then, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]] blew a [[conch shell]] to announce his victory.\n \nHearing the sound of the conch-shell, all that befitted Dharma Yukam - the virtues, the [[Shastra|Sastirankal]], the plants and trees, the reptiles and the birds, the divine women and their children - all gathered around [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikundar]]. He gave them blessings, and instructed them to live fearlessly.

He demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the [[New Model Army]], playing an important role under General Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] in the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalist (\"Cavalier\")]] forces.\n\nCromwell was one of the signatories of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s death warrant in 1649, and he dominated the short-lived [[Commonwealth of England]] as a member of the [[Rump Parliament]] (1649\u20131653). He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649\u20131650. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. During this period, a series of [[Penal Laws]] were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\n\nOn 20 April 1653, he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]] before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as [[Lord Protector]] of England (which included Wales at the time), Scotland, and Ireland from 16 December 1653.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml|title=Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658)}}</ref> As a ruler, he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy. He died from natural causes in 1658 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]]. Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians, but failed to end Royalist resistance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/battle-of-marston-moor|publisher=British Civil Wars| title=The Battle of Marston Moor| accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the [[Second Battle of Newbury]] in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England.

For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.<ref>Jendrysik, p. 79</ref>\n\n===King tried and executed===\n{{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|Execution of Charles I}}\nIn December 1648, in an episode that became known as [[Pride's Purge]], a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.<ref>Macaulay, p. 68</ref> Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.<ref name=bcw/> Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (\"The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\").<ref>Coward 1991, p. 65</ref>\n\nThe death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/collections/deathwarrant/|title=Death Warrant of King Charles I|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or \"[[regicide]]\", was controversial, if for no other reason due to the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021024/http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2015|title=Oliver Cromwell Destroys the \"Divine Right of Kings\"|first=Ben|last=Hart|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: \"None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it.

The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the \"Rump\" and was appointed a member of the Council. In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973). ''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'', and ''Cromwell: the Lord Protector'' (Phoenix Press), {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}} pp.344\u201346; and Austin Woolrych, ''Britain In Revolution'' (Oxford, 2002), p. 470</ref>\n\nAfter the taking of Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to [[Ulster]] to secure the north of the country and went on to [[Siege of Waterford|besiege Waterford]], [[Kilkenny]] and [[Clonmel]] in Ireland's south-east. Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Sickness began to spread in the ranks. Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from [[Dunbar]]. However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.66.</ref> The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n===Battle of Worcester===\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made a desperate attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland.

He switched his reserves from one side of the river Severn to the other and then back again. The editor of the ''Great Rebellion'' article of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (eleventh edition) notes that Worcester was a battle of manoeuvre compared to the early Civil War [[Battle of Turnham Green]], which the English parliamentary armies were unable to execute at the start of the war, and he suggests that it was a prototype for the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]].<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article \"GREAT REBELLION\" Sections \"4.

The rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was largely peaceful, apart from the Highlands. Moreover, there were no wholesale confiscations of land or property. Three out of every four Justices of the Peace in Commonwealth Scotland were Scots and the country was governed jointly by the English military authorities and a Scottish Council of State.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.320.</ref>\n\n==Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651\u20131653==\n{{Wikisource|Dissolution of the Long Parliament}}\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their \"common cause\". Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977). ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0-521-29213-1}}, ch.16\u201317.</ref> Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers. Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\".<ref>Abbott, p.643</ref> At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away.<ref>Abbott, p.642-643.</ref> His troops were commanded by [[Charles Worsley]], later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/charles-worsley|title=Charles Worsley|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Establishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653==\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\". Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia.<ref>Gaunt, p.155.</ref> However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as \"Your Highness\".<ref>Gaunt, p.156.</ref> As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State. Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army.

The first was \"healing and settling\" the nation after the chaos of the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take.<ref>Hirst, Derek (1990). \"The Lord Protector, 1653\u20138\", in Morrill, p.172.</ref> Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, \"Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,\" in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government. Such forms were, he said, \"but&nbsp;... dross and dung in comparison of Christ\".<ref>Quoted in Hirst, p.127.</ref> The social priorities did not, despite the revolutionary nature of the government, include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order.

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654. He declared that \"healing and settling\" were the \"great end of your meeting\".<ref>Roots 1989, pp.41\u201356.</ref> However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms. After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

It was this\u2014allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism\u2014that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Hirst, p.137.</ref> There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on [[Matthew 23]]:37\u201339 and [[Romans 11]]. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

For example, ''The Machiavilian Cromwell'' and ''The Juglers Discovered'' are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the [[Levellers]] after 1647, and both present him as a [[Machiavelli]]an figure.<ref>Morrill, John (1990). \"Cromwell and his contemporaries\", in Morrill, pp.263\u20134.</ref> John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in ''A Warning Piece Discharged'', comparing him to [[Moses]] rescuing the English by taking them safely through the [[Red Sea]] of the civil wars.<ref>Morrill, pp.271\u20132.</ref> Poet [[John Milton]] called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his ''Sonnet XVI''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/4350/poem1456.html |title=RPO - John Milton : Sonnet XVI: To the Lord General Cromwell |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral biographies were published soon after Cromwell's death. An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which describes how Cromwell \"loved men more than books\" and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition.<ref>Morrill, pp. 279\u201381.</ref> An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell \"will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man\".<ref name=g9>Gaunt, p.9.</ref> He argues that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]].<ref name=g9/>\n\nDuring the early 18th century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy.  [[John Toland]] rewrote [[Edmund Ludlow]]'s ''Memoirs'' in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.<ref>Worden, Blair (2001). ''Roundhead Reputations: The English Civil Wars and the Passions of Posterity'' (Penguin), {{ISBN|0-14-100694-3}}, pp. 53\u201359</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I hope to render the English name as great and formidable as ever the Roman was.<ref>\"The Life and Eccentricities of the late Dr. Monsey, F.R.S, physician to the Royal Hospital at Chelsea\", printed by J.D.

[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=Thomas |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |date=December 1843 |url=http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf}}</ref> By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.315.</ref> Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.<ref>Worden, pp.256\u2013260.</ref> Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.318.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge]] described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who \"dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last= Coolidge\n |first= Calvin \n |date= 1929\n |title= The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge\n |location= USA\n |publisher=\n |page= 29\n |isbn= 978-1410216229\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]. Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''. The suggestion was vetoed by [[George V of Great Britain|King George V]] because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish political unrest]], especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the [[Short Parliament|Short]] (1640) and [[Long Parliament|Long]] (1640\u20131649) Parliaments. He entered the [[English Civil War]]s on the side of the \"[[Roundheads]]\" or Parliamentarians, nicknamed \"Old [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]]\". He demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the [[New Model Army]], playing an important role under General Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] in the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalist (\"Cavalier\")]] forces.\n\nCromwell was one of the signatories of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s death warrant in 1649, and he dominated the short-lived [[Commonwealth of England]] as a member of the [[Rump Parliament]] (1649\u20131653). He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649\u20131650. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. During this period, a series of [[Penal Laws]] were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\n\nOn 20 April 1653, he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]] before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as [[Lord Protector]] of England (which included Wales at the time), Scotland, and Ireland from 16 December 1653.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml|title=Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658)}}</ref> As a ruler, he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy.

A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]]. Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians, but failed to end Royalist resistance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/battle-of-marston-moor|publisher=British Civil Wars| title=The Battle of Marston Moor| accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the [[Second Battle of Newbury]] in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

If you move it down, it breaks the line into the next topic.--->\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England. At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.<ref>Gardiner (1901), pp.144\u201347; Gaunt (1997) 94\u201397.</ref>\n\nDuring 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.<ref>Jendrysik, p. 79</ref>\n\n===King tried and executed===\n{{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|Execution of Charles I}}\nIn December 1648, in an episode that became known as [[Pride's Purge]], a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.<ref>Macaulay, p. 68</ref> Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.<ref name=bcw/> Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (\"The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\").<ref>Coward 1991, p. 65</ref>\n\nThe death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/collections/deathwarrant/|title=Death Warrant of King Charles I|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or \"[[regicide]]\", was controversial, if for no other reason due to the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021024/http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2015|title=Oliver Cromwell Destroys the \"Divine Right of Kings\"|first=Ben|last=Hart|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: \"None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it.

The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the \"Rump\" and was appointed a member of the Council. In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973). ''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'', and ''Cromwell: the Lord Protector'' (Phoenix Press), {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}} pp.344\u201346; and Austin Woolrych, ''Britain In Revolution'' (Oxford, 2002), p. 470</ref>\n\nAfter the taking of Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to [[Ulster]] to secure the north of the country and went on to [[Siege of Waterford|besiege Waterford]], [[Kilkenny]] and [[Clonmel]] in Ireland's south-east. Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Sickness began to spread in the ranks. Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from [[Dunbar]]. However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.66.</ref> The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n===Battle of Worcester===\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made a desperate attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland.

He switched his reserves from one side of the river Severn to the other and then back again. The editor of the ''Great Rebellion'' article of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (eleventh edition) notes that Worcester was a battle of manoeuvre compared to the early Civil War [[Battle of Turnham Green]], which the English parliamentary armies were unable to execute at the start of the war, and he suggests that it was a prototype for the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]].<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article \"GREAT REBELLION\" Sections \"4.

The rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was largely peaceful, apart from the Highlands. Moreover, there were no wholesale confiscations of land or property. Three out of every four Justices of the Peace in Commonwealth Scotland were Scots and the country was governed jointly by the English military authorities and a Scottish Council of State.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.320.</ref>\n\n==Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651\u20131653==\n{{Wikisource|Dissolution of the Long Parliament}}\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their \"common cause\". Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977). ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0-521-29213-1}}, ch.16\u201317.</ref> Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers. Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\".<ref>Abbott, p.643</ref> At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away.<ref>Abbott, p.642-643.</ref> His troops were commanded by [[Charles Worsley]], later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/charles-worsley|title=Charles Worsley|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Establishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653==\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\". Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia.<ref>Gaunt, p.155.</ref> However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as \"Your Highness\".<ref>Gaunt, p.156.</ref> As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State. Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army.

The first was \"healing and settling\" the nation after the chaos of the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take.<ref>Hirst, Derek (1990). \"The Lord Protector, 1653\u20138\", in Morrill, p.172.</ref> Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, \"Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,\" in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government. Such forms were, he said, \"but&nbsp;... dross and dung in comparison of Christ\".<ref>Quoted in Hirst, p.127.</ref> The social priorities did not, despite the revolutionary nature of the government, include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order.

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654. He declared that \"healing and settling\" were the \"great end of your meeting\".<ref>Roots 1989, pp.41\u201356.</ref> However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms. After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

It was this\u2014allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism\u2014that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Hirst, p.137.</ref> There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on [[Matthew 23]]:37\u201339 and [[Romans 11]]. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

For example, ''The Machiavilian Cromwell'' and ''The Juglers Discovered'' are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the [[Levellers]] after 1647, and both present him as a [[Machiavelli]]an figure.<ref>Morrill, John (1990). \"Cromwell and his contemporaries\", in Morrill, pp.263\u20134.</ref> John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in ''A Warning Piece Discharged'', comparing him to [[Moses]] rescuing the English by taking them safely through the [[Red Sea]] of the civil wars.<ref>Morrill, pp.271\u20132.</ref> Poet [[John Milton]] called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his ''Sonnet XVI''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/4350/poem1456.html |title=RPO - John Milton : Sonnet XVI: To the Lord General Cromwell |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral biographies were published soon after Cromwell's death. An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which describes how Cromwell \"loved men more than books\" and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition.<ref>Morrill, pp. 279\u201381.</ref> An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell \"will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man\".<ref name=g9>Gaunt, p.9.</ref> He argues that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]].<ref name=g9/>\n\nDuring the early 18th century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy.  [[John Toland]] rewrote [[Edmund Ludlow]]'s ''Memoirs'' in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.<ref>Worden, Blair (2001). ''Roundhead Reputations: The English Civil Wars and the Passions of Posterity'' (Penguin), {{ISBN|0-14-100694-3}}, pp. 53\u201359</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I hope to render the English name as great and formidable as ever the Roman was.<ref>\"The Life and Eccentricities of the late Dr. Monsey, F.R.S, physician to the Royal Hospital at Chelsea\", printed by J.D.

[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=Thomas |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |date=December 1843 |url=http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf}}</ref> By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.315.</ref> Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.<ref>Worden, pp.256\u2013260.</ref> Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.318.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge]] described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who \"dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last= Coolidge\n |first= Calvin \n |date= 1929\n |title= The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge\n |location= USA\n |publisher=\n |page= 29\n |isbn= 978-1410216229\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]. Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''. The suggestion was vetoed by [[George V of Great Britain|King George V]] because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish political unrest]], especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.

It competes in the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Sun Belt Conference]]. The program began play in 1911.  In 1986 and 1987, Troy won [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] national championships under head coach [[Chase Riddle]]. As a [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] program, the team won 10 conference titles and appeared in 14 NCAA Regionals and 7 College World Series.\n\nAs of the end of the [[2019 NCAA Division I baseball season|2019 season]], the program's overall record is '''1,774\u20131,114\u20133'''.  Troy is the 32nd all-time winningest baseball program among all Division 1 programs.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nFew schools in the South, especially in the state of Alabama, possess as rich a history as that of the Troy baseball program.  In the past 40 years alone, Trojan baseball squads have claimed more than 1,300 victories, 14 conference championships, 7 NCAA Regional crowns, and back-to-back Division II NCAA National Championships in 1986 and 1987.\n\nAs early as the turn of the 20th century, old photographs show evidence that Troy fielded an intercollegiate baseball team in the early 1900's, but school records only date back to 1931.  In the teams early years, they were known as the \"Teachers\" since the college was primarily an educational institution for teachers.  In 1931, the Troy Normal School moved all home games to what is now known as [[Riddle-Pace Field]].  The previous playing field, which was located on the quad in front of Shackelford Hall, was the original playing field.  This relocation occurred because of baseballs breaking the windows of Shackelford Hall.\n\n[[File:1912 Troy Normal School baseball team.png|300px|right|thumb|The 1912 Troy Normal School Teachers baseball team, one of the earliest photos of the Troy baseball program.]]\n\n===Chase Riddle era===\nIn 1979, Troy State hired [[Chase Riddle]], who was a manager and scout for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] major league baseball team.  In his first year as the head coach, he led the Trojans to a then-school-record 33 wins and a second place finish in the [[Gulf South Conference]] Eastern Division.  That same season, Troy performed a two-game sweep of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]]; a big accomplishment for an in-state Division II school.\n\nIn Riddle's second season at the helm, he went on to accomplish even more.  His 1980 team finished the season 30\u201312, garnering a significant win over the then #7-ranked [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State Seminoles]] by a score of 5\u20133.  The Trojans would wind up winning the Gulf South Conference championship and the NCAA Central Regional, and making it all the way to the [[NCAA Division II Baseball Championship|NCAA College World Series]].  They were eliminated with a 1\u20132 record from the World Series, but Troy had established themselves as a new powerhouse baseball program.\n\nThe 1981 and 1982 seasons were also huge successes for Riddle and his program.  The program won another Gulf South Conference championship in 1981 with yet another appearance in the College World Series, finishing the season with a 37\u201310 record.  The 1982 season would be nearly a copy of the previous season, with Troy winning yet another conference championship and making it to the College World Series yet again.  Troy would also garner big wins against [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]] and [[Clemson Tigers baseball|Clemson]] that same year.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, the Trojans would go 105\u201342, making three NCAA Regional appearances and two College World Series appearances.\n\nIn 1986, the Trojans defeated [[Columbus State University|Columbus State]], 5\u20130, to win their first NCAA College World Series (Division II).  They finished the season as the #1-ranked team in the country, with a 46\u20138 overall record, and a 12\u20130 conference record to win another Gulf South Conference title.  In 1987, they followed up with yet another national championship by defeating [[University of Tampa|Tampa]], 7\u20135.<ref name=\"ncaarbii\">{{cite web|title=All-Time Results|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_champs_records/2011/d2/champs.pdf|work=NCAA Division II Baseball Record Book|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>  For his successes, head coach [[Chase Riddle]] was named National Head Coach of the Year by the [[American Baseball Coaches Association]] in 1986 and 1987.\n\nChase Riddle would wind up retiring in 1990, finishing his notable career with a record of 434\u2013149\u20132.  Less than one year after his retirement, Riddle's #25 jersey that he wore was retired.  Riddle was inducted into the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2000, the Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, and later into the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n===John Mayotte era===\nUpon transitioning from Division II to Division I, the Trojans finished their tenure in Division II with a 38\u201325 overall record against competition in NCAA postseason play.\n\nIn the Trojan's last season of play in Division II, coach John Mayotte helped continue the trend of Trojan baseball success, leading the team to another College World Series appearance, only to be eliminated with a 2\u20132 record.  The Trojans finished that season ranked #3 in the nation.\n\nAfter coach Mayotte helped lead Troy into their new era of Division I baseball, he led the team to their first Division I NCAA Regional in 1995, just Troy's second season of being in Division I.  Troy was eliminated in the Regional by Florida State and Ole Miss that season. In 1997, Mayotte once again led Troy to another NCAA Regional, where Troy was again eliminated, this time by Alabama and Southern California.\n\n===Bobby Pierce era===\nIn 2003, Troy hired [[Bobby Pierce]] as head coach.  In his 4th season (2006), he led Troy to their 3rd ever appearance in an NCAA Regional.  In what would become one of Pierce's best seasons, his Trojans went 47\u201316 and won their first [[Sun Belt Conference]] championship.  They entered into the Tuscaloosa Regional as the #2-seed team, while also holding a national ranking of #27 by the [[National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association]].  Troy would face #3-seed [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles baseball|Southern Miss]] in the first matchup, with Troy scoring their first victory in a Regional since joining Division I, beating Southern Miss by a score of 10\u20138.  Troy would fall to #1-seed Alabama in the next round, only to face Southern Miss and beating them yet again.  Troy would finally be eliminated from the Regional by Alabama in the final game.  Three players from the 2006 team were taken that year in the [[Major League Baseball draft|MLB Draft]]:  Tom King, Mike Felix, and Jarred Keel.\n\nThe Trojans went on to have a lot of success over the years since that 2006 season, finding themselves ranked in the Top 25 occasionally almost every season, yet never finishing with a national ranking.  That trend would change in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 season saw Troy have one of its strongest batting lineups in the program's history.  The Trojans were in the Top 10 in the NCAA in total home runs, hitting 54 that season.  After getting big wins over [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball|Texas Tech]] and [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]] during the season, the Trojans won another Sun Belt Conference championship, going 40\u201318 during the regular season.  Troy would be ranked #26 by ''[[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper|Collegiate Baseball]]'' going into the Tallahassee Regional, garnering them the #3-seed.  They would face [[Alabama Crimson Tide baseball|Alabama]] in the first round, defeating the Crimson Tide 5\u20132, only to lose to [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State]] in the next round.  After being put into the elimination bracket, Troy had to once again face the Alabama Crimson Tide.  The Trojans would defeat the Tide yet again, this time in a thriller by a score of 9\u20138.  Troy faced Florida State in the finals of the Regional, but wound up being eliminated by the Seminoles, 4\u201311.\n\nThe Trojans would finish the 2013 season with their first ever Top 25 rankings, being ranked '''#23''' by ''[[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper|Collegiate Baseball]]'' and '''#25''' by ''[[Baseball America]]''.\n\nBobby Pierce finished his career with a 450\u2013313 record at Troy, leading the program to their first Top 25 finish and 4 NCAA Regional appearances.  For his accomplishments, Pierce was inducted into the Alabama Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2010, the Wiregrass Hall of Fame in 2017, and the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\n===Mark Smartt era===\nAfter the 2016 season, long-time assistant coach Mark Smartt was hired as Troy's new head coach.  Smartt is a Troy University alumnus and was a member of the Troy State Trojans baseball teams that was Division II national championships in 1986 and 1987.\n\nIn Smartt's second season at the helm, his team would go 31-25, performing a rare accomplishment by defeating every in-state on the schedule in 2017.  The Trojans would defeat [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]], [[Auburn Tigers|Auburn]], [[UAB Blazers|UAB]], [[South Alabama Jaguars|South Alabama]], [[Alabama State Hornets|Alabama State]], [[Samford Bulldogs|Samford]], and [[Jacksonville State Gamecocks|Jacksonville State]] that season.\n\nIn 2018, in just Smartt's third season as head coach, he led Troy to a 2nd-place finish in the Sun Belt Conference and finished with a 42-21 record that season.  The team would make it all the way to the Sun Belt Conference Tournament finals against #19 [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]], only to lose 6-11 to the Chanticleers.  Troy wound up receiving an at-large bid to the [[2018 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they would face #18 [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] in the first round, defeating the Blue Devils by a score of 6-0.  The Trojans' fortunes would fade from there though, losing to #9 [[Georgia Bulldogs baseball|Georgia]] in the next round, and finally being eliminated in a re-match with Duke.  Troy finished the season with the sixth-most wins in school history, while garnering a few wins over Top 25 ranked teams, including #17 [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]], #18 [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]], and #22 [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]].\n\n==Coaches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Troy Trojans|Years|Coach|Record}}\n|-\n| 1954\u20131960\n| Paul Nix\n| 92\u201345\n|-\n| 1961\u20131964\n| Melvin Lucas\n| 62\u201330\n|-\n| 1965\u20131966\n| Billy Williams\n| 21\u201319\n|-\n| 1967\u20131968\n| Phillip Creel\n| 21\u201327\n|-\n| 1969\u20131970\n| Frank Rosado\n| 22\u201321\n|-\n| 1971\n| Bo Gaylard\n| 7\u201314\n|-\n| 1972\n| Bob Boothe\n| 18\u201324\n|-\n| 1973\u20131974<br>1976\u20131978\n| [[Joe Hollis]]\n| 106\u201375\n|-\n| 1975\n| Larry Maier\n| 14\u201312\n|-\n| 1979\u20131990\n| [[Chase Riddle]]\n| 434\u2013149\u20132\n|-\n| 1991\u20132002\n| John Mayotte\n| 386\u2013273\u20131\n|-\n| 2003\u20132015\n| [[Bobby Pierce]]\n| 450\u2013313\n|-\n| 2016\u2013Present\n| Mark Smartt\n| 105\u201371\n|}\n\n==Riddle-Pace Field==\n[[Image:Riddle Pace Field 7.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Riddle-Pace Field entrance at Troy University.]]\n\n\n\n[[Riddle-Pace Field]], located on the university's campus, is the program's home venue.  It is named for [[Chase Riddle]], former head coach of the program, and Matthew Downer Pace, who served Troy University from 1891 to 1941 as Professor of Mathematics, Dean, and President.\n\nThe stadium features a brick concourse, a three-story press box, restrooms, a concession stand, and a merchandise booth.  The stadium has a capacity of 2,000 spectators, which includes 1,700 bleacher seats and 300 chair-back seats.  More spectator areas are located beyond the left field fence and adjacent to the home plate dugout.  The Lott Baseball Complex was built along the left field fence, which houses coaches offices, player locker rooms and lounge, and an indoor batting cage.\n\nThe field had its grass turf removed and was replaced with artificial grass turf in 2008.  Troy was one of only three college baseball programs at the time to switch from grass fields to artificial turf.  A state-of-the-art drainage system was installed with the new artificial turf, lending the Troy baseball team the ability to play games in a very short amount of time after heavy rains come through.\n\nThe field has become known for its \"Monster\" wall in right field, a 27-foot tall black wall with a built-in scoreboard and video board.  It's currently one of the largest outfield walls in all of college baseball.\n\n==Attendance==\n[[Image:Troy Baseball Player.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Former Troy shortstop Shohei Fujita.]]\nTroy has been ranked in the NCAA's Top 50 for annual average home attendance for multiple seasons since the early 2000s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> Year</span>\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> National Rank</span>\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> Avg.

baseball]] team of [[Troy University]], located in [[Troy, Alabama]], United States. It competes in the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Sun Belt Conference]]. The program began play in 1911.  In 1986 and 1987, Troy won [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] national championships under head coach [[Chase Riddle]]. As a [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] program, the team won 10 conference titles and appeared in 14 NCAA Regionals and 7 College World Series.\n\nAs of the end of the [[2019 NCAA Division I baseball season|2019 season]], the program's overall record is '''1,774\u20131,114\u20133'''.  Troy is the 32nd all-time winningest baseball program among all Division 1 programs.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nFew schools in the South, especially in the state of Alabama, possess as rich a history as that of the Troy baseball program.  In the past 40 years alone, Trojan baseball squads have claimed more than 1,300 victories, 14 conference championships, 7 NCAA Regional crowns, and back-to-back Division II NCAA National Championships in 1986 and 1987.\n\nAs early as the turn of the 20th century, old photographs show evidence that Troy fielded an intercollegiate baseball team in the early 1900's, but school records only date back to 1931.  In the teams early years, they were known as the \"Teachers\" since the college was primarily an educational institution for teachers.  In 1931, the Troy Normal School moved all home games to what is now known as [[Riddle-Pace Field]].  The previous playing field, which was located on the quad in front of Shackelford Hall, was the original playing field.  This relocation occurred because of baseballs breaking the windows of Shackelford Hall.\n\n[[File:1912 Troy Normal School baseball team.png|300px|right|thumb|The 1912 Troy Normal School Teachers baseball team, one of the earliest photos of the Troy baseball program.]]\n\n===Chase Riddle era===\nIn 1979, Troy State hired [[Chase Riddle]], who was a manager and scout for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] major league baseball team.  In his first year as the head coach, he led the Trojans to a then-school-record 33 wins and a second place finish in the [[Gulf South Conference]] Eastern Division.  That same season, Troy performed a two-game sweep of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]]; a big accomplishment for an in-state Division II school.\n\nIn Riddle's second season at the helm, he went on to accomplish even more.  His 1980 team finished the season 30\u201312, garnering a significant win over the then #7-ranked [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State Seminoles]] by a score of 5\u20133.  The Trojans would wind up winning the Gulf South Conference championship and the NCAA Central Regional, and making it all the way to the [[NCAA Division II Baseball Championship|NCAA College World Series]].  They were eliminated with a 1\u20132 record from the World Series, but Troy had established themselves as a new powerhouse baseball program.\n\nThe 1981 and 1982 seasons were also huge successes for Riddle and his program.  The program won another Gulf South Conference championship in 1981 with yet another appearance in the College World Series, finishing the season with a 37\u201310 record.  The 1982 season would be nearly a copy of the previous season, with Troy winning yet another conference championship and making it to the College World Series yet again.  Troy would also garner big wins against [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]] and [[Clemson Tigers baseball|Clemson]] that same year.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, the Trojans would go 105\u201342, making three NCAA Regional appearances and two College World Series appearances.\n\nIn 1986, the Trojans defeated [[Columbus State University|Columbus State]], 5\u20130, to win their first NCAA College World Series (Division II).  They finished the season as the #1-ranked team in the country, with a 46\u20138 overall record, and a 12\u20130 conference record to win another Gulf South Conference title.  In 1987, they followed up with yet another national championship by defeating [[University of Tampa|Tampa]], 7\u20135.<ref name=\"ncaarbii\">{{cite web|title=All-Time Results|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_champs_records/2011/d2/champs.pdf|work=NCAA Division II Baseball Record Book|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>  For his successes, head coach [[Chase Riddle]] was named National Head Coach of the Year by the [[American Baseball Coaches Association]] in 1986 and 1987.\n\nChase Riddle would wind up retiring in 1990, finishing his notable career with a record of 434\u2013149\u20132.  Less than one year after his retirement, Riddle's #25 jersey that he wore was retired.  Riddle was inducted into the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2000, the Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, and later into the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n===John Mayotte era===\nUpon transitioning from Division II to Division I, the Trojans finished their tenure in Division II with a 38\u201325 overall record against competition in NCAA postseason play.\n\nIn the Trojan's last season of play in Division II, coach John Mayotte helped continue the trend of Trojan baseball success, leading the team to another College World Series appearance, only to be eliminated with a 2\u20132 record.  The Trojans finished that season ranked #3 in the nation.\n\nAfter coach Mayotte helped lead Troy into their new era of Division I baseball, he led the team to their first Division I NCAA Regional in 1995, just Troy's second season of being in Division I.  Troy was eliminated in the Regional by Florida State and Ole Miss that season. In 1997, Mayotte once again led Troy to another NCAA Regional, where Troy was again eliminated, this time by Alabama and Southern California.\n\n===Bobby Pierce era===\nIn 2003, Troy hired [[Bobby Pierce]] as head coach.  In his 4th season (2006), he led Troy to their 3rd ever appearance in an NCAA Regional.  In what would become one of Pierce's best seasons, his Trojans went 47\u201316 and won their first [[Sun Belt Conference]] championship.  They entered into the Tuscaloosa Regional as the #2-seed team, while also holding a national ranking of #27 by the [[National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association]].  Troy would face #3-seed [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles baseball|Southern Miss]] in the first matchup, with Troy scoring their first victory in a Regional since joining Division I, beating Southern Miss by a score of 10\u20138.  Troy would fall to #1-seed Alabama in the next round, only to face Southern Miss and beating them yet again.  Troy would finally be eliminated from the Regional by Alabama in the final game.  Three players from the 2006 team were taken that year in the [[Major League Baseball draft|MLB Draft]]:  Tom King, Mike Felix, and Jarred Keel.\n\nThe Trojans went on to have a lot of success over the years since that 2006 season, finding themselves ranked in the Top 25 occasionally almost every season, yet never finishing with a national ranking.  That trend would change in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 season saw Troy have one of its strongest batting lineups in the program's history.  The Trojans were in the Top 10 in the NCAA in total home runs, hitting 54 that season.  After getting big wins over [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball|Texas Tech]] and [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]] during the season, the Trojans won another Sun Belt Conference championship, going 40\u201318 during the regular season.  Troy would be ranked #26 by ''[[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper|Collegiate Baseball]]'' going into the Tallahassee Regional, garnering them the #3-seed.  They would face [[Alabama Crimson Tide baseball|Alabama]] in the first round, defeating the Crimson Tide 5\u20132, only to lose to [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State]] in the next round.  After being put into the elimination bracket, Troy had to once again face the Alabama Crimson Tide.  The Trojans would defeat the Tide yet again, this time in a thriller by a score of 9\u20138.  Troy faced Florida State in the finals of the Regional, but wound up being eliminated by the Seminoles, 4\u201311.\n\nThe Trojans would finish the 2013 season with their first ever Top 25 rankings, being ranked '''#23''' by ''[[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper|Collegiate Baseball]]'' and '''#25''' by ''[[Baseball America]]''.\n\nBobby Pierce finished his career with a 450\u2013313 record at Troy, leading the program to their first Top 25 finish and 4 NCAA Regional appearances.  For his accomplishments, Pierce was inducted into the Alabama Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2010, the Wiregrass Hall of Fame in 2017, and the Troy Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\n===Mark Smartt era===\nAfter the 2016 season, long-time assistant coach Mark Smartt was hired as Troy's new head coach.  Smartt is a Troy University alumnus and was a member of the Troy State Trojans baseball teams that was Division II national championships in 1986 and 1987.\n\nIn Smartt's second season at the helm, his team would go 31-25, performing a rare accomplishment by defeating every in-state on the schedule in 2017.  The Trojans would defeat [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]], [[Auburn Tigers|Auburn]], [[UAB Blazers|UAB]], [[South Alabama Jaguars|South Alabama]], [[Alabama State Hornets|Alabama State]], [[Samford Bulldogs|Samford]], and [[Jacksonville State Gamecocks|Jacksonville State]] that season.\n\nIn 2018, in just Smartt's third season as head coach, he led Troy to a 2nd-place finish in the Sun Belt Conference and finished with a 42-21 record that season.  The team would make it all the way to the Sun Belt Conference Tournament finals against #19 [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]], only to lose 6-11 to the Chanticleers.  Troy wound up receiving an at-large bid to the [[2018 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they would face #18 [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] in the first round, defeating the Blue Devils by a score of 6-0.  The Trojans' fortunes would fade from there though, losing to #9 [[Georgia Bulldogs baseball|Georgia]] in the next round, and finally being eliminated in a re-match with Duke.  Troy finished the season with the sixth-most wins in school history, while garnering a few wins over Top 25 ranked teams, including #17 [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]], #18 [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]], and #22 [[Auburn Tigers baseball|Auburn]].\n\n==Coaches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Troy Trojans|Years|Coach|Record}}\n|-\n| 1954\u20131960\n| Paul Nix\n| 92\u201345\n|-\n| 1961\u20131964\n| Melvin Lucas\n| 62\u201330\n|-\n| 1965\u20131966\n| Billy Williams\n| 21\u201319\n|-\n| 1967\u20131968\n| Phillip Creel\n| 21\u201327\n|-\n| 1969\u20131970\n| Frank Rosado\n| 22\u201321\n|-\n| 1971\n| Bo Gaylard\n| 7\u201314\n|-\n| 1972\n| Bob Boothe\n| 18\u201324\n|-\n| 1973\u20131974<br>1976\u20131978\n| [[Joe Hollis]]\n| 106\u201375\n|-\n| 1975\n| Larry Maier\n| 14\u201312\n|-\n| 1979\u20131990\n| [[Chase Riddle]]\n| 434\u2013149\u20132\n|-\n| 1991\u20132002\n| John Mayotte\n| 386\u2013273\u20131\n|-\n| 2003\u20132015\n| [[Bobby Pierce]]\n| 450\u2013313\n|-\n| 2016\u2013Present\n| Mark Smartt\n| 105\u201371\n|}\n\n==Riddle-Pace Field==\n[[Image:Riddle Pace Field 7.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Riddle-Pace Field entrance at Troy University.]]\n\n\n\n[[Riddle-Pace Field]], located on the university's campus, is the program's home venue.  It is named for [[Chase Riddle]], former head coach of the program, and Matthew Downer Pace, who served Troy University from 1891 to 1941 as Professor of Mathematics, Dean, and President.\n\nThe stadium features a brick concourse, a three-story press box, restrooms, a concession stand, and a merchandise booth.  The stadium has a capacity of 2,000 spectators, which includes 1,700 bleacher seats and 300 chair-back seats.  More spectator areas are located beyond the left field fence and adjacent to the home plate dugout.  The Lott Baseball Complex was built along the left field fence, which houses coaches offices, player locker rooms and lounge, and an indoor batting cage.\n\nThe field had its grass turf removed and was replaced with artificial grass turf in 2008.  Troy was one of only three college baseball programs at the time to switch from grass fields to artificial turf.  A state-of-the-art drainage system was installed with the new artificial turf, lending the Troy baseball team the ability to play games in a very short amount of time after heavy rains come through.\n\nThe field has become known for its \"Monster\" wall in right field, a 27-foot tall black wall with a built-in scoreboard and video board.  It's currently one of the largest outfield walls in all of college baseball.\n\n==Attendance==\n[[Image:Troy Baseball Player.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Former Troy shortstop Shohei Fujita.]]\nTroy has been ranked in the NCAA's Top 50 for annual average home attendance for multiple seasons since the early 2000's.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> Year</span>\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> National Rank</span>\n! style=\"background:#8e0028;\"| <span style=\"color:white;\"> Avg.
