The show diverges from the YouTube series in that the Fruit Gang live on a fruit stand in a supermarket called \"Daneboe's\" (a reference to the creator Dane Boedigheimer) rather than in Dane Boedigheimer's kitchen.\n\nA reoccurring character from the ''Annoying Orange'' YouTube series called Nerville (played by internet personality [[Toby Turner]]) now runs the supermarket (mainly as the janitor), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episodes}}\n{{:List of The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) \u2013 The main protagonist of the series. He is annoying, obnoxious, and partial to terrible puns. But deep down, Orange always means well, even though his boredom often drags his friends into ridiculous adventures. The series shows another side of Orange that differs from his YouTube persona and casts him as a wacky hero.\n* Pear (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 Pear is Orange's best friend, and he often stands as the sole voice of reason in the fruit stand.\n* Passion Fruit (voiced by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]]) \u2013 Often referred to as \"Passion\", she is adorable, pragmatic, and smart. She has a crush on Orange, which is no secret, except to Orange, who sometimes remains completely oblivious.\n* Midget Apple (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 An small apple with a scrappy demeanor. He prefers to be called \"Little Apple\", and a running gag is that he will correct anyone who calls him \"Midget Apple\".\n* Marshmallow (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 Marshmallow is a cute, eternally upbeat, and cheerful marshmallow. \n* Grapefruit (voiced by Robert Jennings) \u2013 Grapefruit is a hulking man-boy who thinks of himself as \"large and in charge\". He believes he is in a rivalry with Orange for Passion Fruit's affection, but she has no interest in him.\n* Apple (voiced by [[Harland Williams]]) \u2013 Apple is an insecure and pessimistic criticizer who rarely joins Orange's adventures for fear he will get bruised, though he usually ends up even worse off just by staying behind. There is a running gag where Apple gets killed in every episode, similar to [[Kenny McCormick]] from [[South Park]].\n* Grandpa Lemon (voiced by Kevin Brueck) \u2013 Grandpa Lemon is the befuddled, elder statesman of the fruit stand. He thinks he is everybody's grandpa and has a habit of falling asleep mid-sentence.\n* Nerville (played by [[Toby Turner]]) \u2013 Nerville is an employee at Daneboes Fruit Store, where he lives, and is the only human who can talk to the fruits (as other humans dismiss it as insanity). He is a close friend to the fruits.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Coconut (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 Good-natured, but dim and hard-headed, Coconut is an occasional member of the Fruit Gang where he serves as the muscle.\n* Peach (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) \u2013 Another member of the Fruit Gang, she is a peach who normally makes cameos. \n* Broccoli Alien Overlord (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 An evil alien broccoli, who speaks with an English accent, and serves as the main antagonist of the series. He is bent on enslaving Earth and becoming superior to fruit, though later his goals seem to be focused solely on destroying the Fruit Cart.\n* Guava (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a member of the Fruit Gang who got women's legs after dreaming about them.\n* Ginger (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) \u2013 An organic ginger root who has a crush on Pear.\n* Elderly Banana (voiced by Tom Sheppard) - A very old and ripe banana that talks about scary stuff when he is with the Fruit Gang.\n* Big Rock Candy Monster (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 A monster made entirely of rock candy and a native of the planet Marshmalia. Upset because marshmallows took their place in desserts, he swore revenge against them. After his initial appearance, he becomes a reoccurring character. He has also appeared in the Annoying Orange YouTube channel in a ''[[Gangnam Style]]'' parody video.\n\n===Special guest stars===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as Cyber-Pear, Jalape\u00f1o\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Pea\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Blinky, Veggie Zombie Leader, Bananadon\n* Ben Giroux as the Ugly Princess of the Realm<ref>http://bengiroux.com/media/the-annoying-orange/</ref>\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as [[According to Jim|Jim Salad]]\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Potato, Veggie Zombies\n* [[Dane Boedigheimer]] as Camping Dude, Kingpin, Security Officers, Neighborhood Watch Posse, Tennis Ball, Fruit, Apple, Orange on tree, Pauly Dingdang, Lettuce, Palace Gourd\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as Joseph Celery\n* Kevin Brueck as Kingpin, Milk Bottle, Baby Kumquat, Neighborhood Watch Posse, Apple Trebek, the Bries Member #1\n* [[Peter Browngardt]] as Cyber-Marshmallow 9000\n* [[Corey Burton]] as Cyber-Apple\n* [[Greg Cipes]] as Joey the Carrot\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Sheriff Cantaloupe\n* Cuddles as Herself\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Arugula, Endive, Professor Plum, Reporter<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.awn.com/interstitial/interstitial.php?referer=http%3A//www.awn.com/news/voice-acting/annoying-orange-slices-prime-time Annoying Orange Slices into Prime Time].

The show diverges from the YouTube series in that the Fruit Gang live on a fruit stand in a supermarket called \"Daneboe's\" (a reference to the creator Dane Boedigheimer) rather than in Dane Boedigheimer's kitchen.\n\nA reoccurring character from the ''Annoying Orange'' YouTube series called Nerville (played by internet personality [[Toby Turner]]) now runs the supermarket (mainly as the janitor), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episodes}}\n{{:List of The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) \u2013 The main protagonist of the series. He is annoying, obnoxious, and partial to terrible puns. But deep down, Orange always means well, even though his boredom often drags his friends into ridiculous adventures. The series shows another side of Orange that differs from his YouTube persona and casts him as a wacky hero.\n* Pear (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 Pear is Orange's best friend, and he often stands as the sole voice of reason in the fruit stand.\n* Passion Fruit (voiced by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]]) \u2013 Often referred to as \"Passion\", she is adorable, pragmatic, and smart. She has a crush on Orange, which is no secret, except to Orange, who sometimes remains completely oblivious.\n* Midget Apple (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 An small apple with a scrappy demeanor. He prefers to be called \"Little Apple\", and a running gag is that he will correct anyone who calls him \"Midget Apple\".\n* Marshmallow (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) \u2013 Marshmallow is a cute, eternally upbeat, and cheerful marshmallow. \n* Grapefruit (voiced by Robert Jennings) \u2013 Grapefruit is a hulking man-boy who thinks of himself as \"large and in charge\". He believes he is in a rivalry with Orange for Passion Fruit's affection, but she has no interest in him.\n* Apple (voiced by [[Harland Williams]]) \u2013 Apple is an insecure and pessimistic criticizer who rarely joins Orange's adventures for fear he will get bruised, though he usually ends up even worse off just by staying behind. There is a running gag where Apple gets killed in every episode, similar to Kenny McCormick from [[South Park]].\n* Grandpa Lemon (voiced by Kevin Brueck) \u2013 Grandpa Lemon is the befuddled, elder statesman of the fruit stand. He thinks he is everybody's grandpa and has a habit of falling asleep mid-sentence.\n* Nerville (played by [[Toby Turner]]) \u2013 Nerville is an employee at Daneboes Fruit Store, where he lives, and is the only human who can talk to the fruits (as other humans dismiss it as insanity). He is a close friend to the fruits.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Coconut (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 Good-natured, but dim and hard-headed, Coconut is an occasional member of the Fruit Gang where he serves as the muscle.\n* Peach (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) \u2013 Another member of the Fruit Gang, she is a peach who normally makes cameos. \n* Broccoli Alien Overlord (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 An evil alien broccoli, who speaks with an English accent, and serves as the main antagonist of the series. He is bent on enslaving Earth and becoming superior to fruit, though later his goals seem to be focused solely on destroying the Fruit Cart.\n* Guava (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a member of the Fruit Gang who got women's legs after dreaming about them.\n* Ginger (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) \u2013 An organic ginger root who has a crush on Pear.\n* Elderly Banana (voiced by Tom Sheppard) - A very old and ripe banana that talks about scary stuff when he is with the Fruit Gang.\n* Big Rock Candy Monster (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 A monster made entirely of rock candy, and a native of the planet Marshmalia. Upset because marshmallows took their place in desserts, he swore revenge against them. After his initial appearance he becomes a reoccurring character. He has also appeared in the Annoying Orange YouTube channel in a ''[[Gangnam Style]]'' parody video.\n\n===Special guest stars===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as Cyber-Pear, Jalape\u00f1o\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Pea\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Blinky, Veggie Zombie Leader, Bananadon\n* Ben Giroux as the Ugly Princess of the Realm<ref>http://bengiroux.com/media/the-annoying-orange/</ref>\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as [[According to Jim|Jim Salad]]\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Potato, Veggie Zombies\n* [[Dane Boedigheimer]] as Camping Dude, Kingpin, Security Officers, Neighborhood Watch Posse, Tennis Ball, Fruit, Apple, Orange on tree, Pauly Dingdang, Lettuce, Palace Gourd\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as Joseph Celery\n* Kevin Brueck as Kingpin, Milk Bottle, Baby Kumquat, Neighborhood Watch Posse, Apple Trebek, the Bries Member #1\n* [[Peter Browngardt]] as Cyber-Marshmallow 9000\n* [[Corey Burton]] as Cyber-Apple\n* [[Greg Cipes]] as Joey the Carrot\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Sheriff Cantaloupe\n* Cuddles as Herself\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Arugula, Endive, Professor Plum, Reporter<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.awn.com/interstitial/interstitial.php?referer=http%3A//www.awn.com/news/voice-acting/annoying-orange-slices-prime-time Annoying Orange Slices into Prime Time].

Nelson further writes about ''Silver Landings'' lyrics, saying that \"Moore\u2019s lyrics speak from a shakier place; she can\u2019t experience the security of the present moment without also seeing it crash into the insecurity of the next.\"<ref name=\"Nelson\"/> On ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', Seth Wilson wrote, \"By drawing on the sounds of \u201870s singer-songwriters, Moore has successfully completed the transition from her teen-pop origins to adult troubadour.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nCredits adapted from [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]] [[metadata]].<ref>{{cite web |title=''Silver Landings'' by Mandy Moore |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/silver-landings/1492747819 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=January 14, 2020 |location=United States}}</ref> All music is produced by [[Mike Viola]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = ''Silver Landings'' track listing\n| total_length = 41:03\n\n| title1       = I'd Rather Lose\n| writer1      = {{hlist|[[Mandy Moore]]|[[Taylor Goldsmith]]|[[Mike Viola]]|[[Sean Douglas (songwriter)|Sean Douglas]]}}\n| length1      = 3:45\n\n| title2       = Save a Little for Yourself\n| writer2      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|Douglas}}\n| length2      = 3:39\n\n| title3       = Fifteen\n| writer3      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|[[Jason Boesel]]}}\n| length3      = 4:09\n\n| title4       = Tryin' My Best, Los Angeles\n| writer4      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|Douglas}}\n| length4      = 4:01\n\n| title5       = Easy Target\n| writer5      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|[[Chris Walla]]}}\n| length5      = 4:38\n\n| title6       = [[When I Wasn't Watching]]\n| writer6      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|Boesel}}\n| length6      = 3:29\n\n| title7       = Forgiveness\n| writer7      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|Boesel}}\n| length7      = 4:36\n\n| title8       = Stories Reminding Myself of Me\n| writer8      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|Douglas}}\n| length8      = 3:57\n\n| title9       = If That's What It Takes\n| writer9      = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|[[Lori McKenna]]}}\n| length9      = 4:06\n\n| title10      = Silver Landings\n| writer10     = {{hlist|Moore|Viola|Goldsmith|[[Natalie Hemby]]}}\n| length10     = 4:43\n}}\n\n== Personnel  ==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/132814716/credits|title=Credits / Silver Landings / Mandy Moore \u2013 TIDAL|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col}}\n* Mandy Moore \u2013 vocals\n* Dave Cerminara  \u2013 mixing\n* David Boucher  \u2013 recording {{small|(tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10)}}\n* Eric Boulanger  \u2013 mastering\n* Mike Viola  \u2013 recording, production, composer\n* Wesley Seidman \u2013 recording {{small|(tracks 1, 4, 8)}}, assistant recording {{small|(tracks 2, 6, 7)}}\n* Alan Hampton  \u2013 bass {{small|(tracks 3, 9,10)}}\n* Tyler Chester  \u2013 bass {{small|(tracks 1, 2, 4, 8)}}, piano {{small|(tracks 3, 9)}}, electric piano {{small|(track 10)}}, keyboards {{small|(track 7)}}\n* Taylor Goldsmith  \u2013 drums {{small|(track 1)}}, electric guitar {{small|(tracks 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10)}}, guitar {{small|(track 3)}}\n* Griffin Goldsmith  \u2013 drums {{small|(tracks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)}}\n* [[Davey Faragher]]  \u2013 electric bass {{small|(tracks 2, 6, 9)}}, bass {{small|(tracks 5, 7)}}\n* Sean Douglas  \u2013 piano {{small|(tracks 2, 4, 8)}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Sales chart performance for ''Silver Landings''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{album chart|Billboard200|134|artist=Mandy Moore|rowheader=true|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{album chart|BillboardAlbumSales|17|artist=Mandy Moore|rowheader=true|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[List of 2020 albums]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Mandy Moore}}\n\n[[Category:2020 albums]]\n[[Category:Mandy Moore albums]]\n[[Category:Verve Forecast Records albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Mike Viola]]\n", "name_user": "VLGEdit", "label": "safe", "comment": "label name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Landings"}

All of a sudden a heavy fog rose up from the sea. The deer ran towards the top of a cliff and Dom Fuas in the midst of the fog was cut off from his companions. When he realised he was on the edge of the cliff he recognised the place. He was next to a small grotto where a statue of Our Lady with the Enfant was venerated. Thus he prayed out loud ''Our Lady, Help Me''. All of a sudden the horse miraculously stopped at the end of a rocky point suspended over the void, the Bico do Milagre (Point of the Miracle), thus saving the rider and his mount from a drop of more than 100 metres, a fall that would certainly have caused their death.\n\nDom Fuas dismounted and went down to the grotto to pray and give thanks for the miracle. Then he ordered his companions to fetch masons in order to build a small chapel over the grotto so that the miraculous image could be easily venerated by all and as a memorial to the miracle that saved him. Then before walling up the grotto the masons destroyed the existing altar were amongst the stones they found an ivory chest containing some reliques and an old parchment describing the story of the little wooden statue, one palm high, of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] seated breastfeeding baby [[Jesus]] seated on her left leg.\n\nAccording to the parchment the statue must have been venerated since the beginning of Christianity in [[Nazareth]], in Palestine. It was rescued from the [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] in the fifth century by the monk Ciriaco. It was he who brought it to [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], to the monastery of Cauliniana, near [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], where it remained until 711, the year of the [[battle of Guadalete]], when the Christian forces were defeated by the Moorish invading army coming from north Africa.\n\nWhen the news of the defeat arrived at M\u00e9rida, the friars of Cauliniana prepared to leave their monastery. Meanwhile, the defeated king, [[Roderic]], who was able to flee the battlefield alone and disguised as a beggar anonymously asked for shelter at the monastery. When he asked one of the friars, Frei Romano, to hear him in [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] he had to tell who he really was. Then the friar suggested they flee together taking with them an old and holy image of Mary with the Enfant venerated at the monastery.\n\nSo the statue of Our Lady of Nazar\u00e9, which received its name from the village in Holy Land where it was first venerated, was brought by friar Romano and by king Roderic to the Atlantic coast. When they reached their destination they settled in an empty hermitage on the top of a rocky hill, the Monte de S. Bartolomeu, and there they stayed for a few days. They then decided to separate and live by themselves as hermits. The friar took the image and settled in a little grotto, on the edge of a cliff above the sea, next to the hill where the king went on living.\n\nA year went by and Roderic decided to leave the region. Friar Romano stayed in his hermitage above the sea until he died. The holy statue, a [[black Madonna]], stayed on the altar where he left it until 1182, when Dom Fuas, after the miracle, moved it to the chapel built over the grotto as a memorial to the event that saved his life.

The Cubs played their first home game at the park on April 20, [[1916 Chicago Cubs season|1916]], defeating the [[1916 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] with a score of 7\u20136 in 11 innings. Chewing gum magnate [[William Wrigley Jr.]] of the [[Wrigley Company]] acquired complete control of the Cubs in [[1921 Chicago Cubs season|1921]].

The two recessed wall areas, or \"''wells''\", located both in left and right field, give those areas a little more length than if the wall were to follow the contour from center field. It is also in those wells, when cross winds are blowing, that balls have a habit of bouncing in all directions. In addition, there is a long chain-link fence strip running the entire length of the outfield wall, the base of which is about two feet down from the top of the wall and the top of which projects out at an angle, primarily used to keep fans from falling out of the bleacher area and onto the field of play, which is about seven to ten feet below the top of the wall.

The rooftops were not seen as \"big business.\" They would later become a popular spectator area during the 1929 World Series. The 1938 World Series brought \"paying\" spectators to the rooftops. Fans sat in lawn chairs and brought their own food and beverages. It was not until the mid 1980s that owners began updating the rooftops with bleacher-style grandstands. The rooftops were also turned into a legitimate business. More businesses began purchasing rooftops around Wrigley Field seeing them as profitable resources. The Sky Box on Sheffield open in 1993. Back then, it catered to corporate groups. Today, it is complete with a two-tier roof deck, indoor clubhouse, fully staffed bars on three levels, and an elevator.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1998, the city required rooftop owners to have a license and began to regulate the venues. In 2003, relations between rooftop owners and the Cubs worsened when the team put up a large screen to block the view of the rooftops. The screens exemplified what is known as a [[spite fence]]. The Cubs then sued most rooftop businesses that year. The Cubs felt that the rooftops were stealing from the team's product and the rooftop owners were \"unjustly enriching themselves.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |title=Wrigley Rooftops' Quirky Past Preceded Big Business, Sour Relationship with Cubs|first=Becky|last=Yerak|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-wrigley-rooftops-history-1028-biz-20161027-story.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 27, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the building owners agreed to share a portion of their proceeds with the Cubs.

The Lakeview Baseball Club, which sits across Sheffield Avenue (right-field) from the stadium displayed a sign that read, \"Eamus Catuli!\" (roughly Latin for \"Let's Go Cubs!\"\u2014''catuli'' translating to \"[[wikt:whelp|whelps]]\", the nearest Latin equivalent), flanked by a counter indicating the Cubs' long legacy of futility. The counter was labeled \"AC\", for \"Anno Catulorum\", or \"In the Year of the Cubs\". Prior to the team's 2016 championship, it read AC0871108, with the first two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs' last division championship as of the end of the previous season ([[2008 Chicago Cubs season|2008]]), the next two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs won the National League Pennant ([[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]]), and the last three digits indicating the number of years since their last [[World Series]] win ({{wsy|1908}}).

In the summer, however, or on any warm and breezy day, the wind often comes from the south and the southwest, which means the wind is \"blowing out\" and has the potential to turn normally harmless fly balls into home runs. A third variety is the cross-wind, which typically runs from the left field corner to the right field corner and causes all sorts of havoc. Depending on the direction of the wind, Wrigley can either be one of the friendliest parks in the major leagues for pitchers or among the worst. This makes Wrigley one of the most unpredictable parks in the Major Leagues.\n\nMany Cubs fans check their nearest flag before heading to the park on game days for an indication of what the game might be like; this is less of a factor for night games, however, because the wind does not blow as hard after the sun goes down.\n\nWith the wind blowing ''in'', pitchers can dominate and [[no-hitter]]s have resulted. The last two by a Cubs pitcher occurred near the beginning and the end of the 1972 season, by [[Burt Hooton]] and [[Milt Pappas]] respectively; not until [[Cole Hamels]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] no-hit the Cubs in 2015 would another no-hitter be pitched at Wrigley. In the seventh inning of [[Ken Holtzman]]'s first no-hitter, on August 19, 1969, [[Hank Aaron]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] hit a ball that looked headed for the bleachers, but the wind caught it just enough for left fielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] to leap up and snare it.\n\nWith the wind blowing ''out'', some true tape-measure home runs have been hit by well-muscled batters.

The scoreboard is made of sheet steel. The numbers that are placed into the inning windows are also steel, painted forest green, and numbered with white numerals. The box for the game playing at Wrigley uses yellow numerals for the current inning. The clock, which sits at the top center of the scoreboard, has never lost time in its 78-year existence.

A [[Budweiser]] Beer slogan was on the lower panel in the early 1980s about the time when the team added the LED signage. Past and present owners of the park have used the marquee in some way as the park's trademark of sorts: the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] Addison street platform that serves Wrigley Field uses an image of the marquee, painted on walls to announce the destination.

This would have allowed the Wrigley Field-hosted (i.e. daytime) games to be held over the weekend. In return, only one [[prime time]] game (Game 3 on Friday) would have been lost. Wrigley Field wouldn't have lights installed until [[1988 Chicago Cubs season|four years later]]. To put things in proper perspective, had the Cubs advanced to the Series instead of the Padres, the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] would have hosted Games 1\u20132, and 6\u20137 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3\u20135 (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time zone|Central Time]]. Since the Padres wound up winning the 1984 NLCS, these plans proved moot. \n\nAfter 5,687 consecutive day games played by the Cubs at Wrigley, the lights were finally lit on August 8, 1988, for a game with the Philadelphia Phillies. That game was rained out after 3\u00bd innings,<ref name=\"lights\" /> and the first official night game took place the following evening against the New York Mets, a game which the Cubs won 6\u20134.<ref name=\"lights\" />\n\nThe [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]'s first All-Star Game during the 1943 midseason, was played under temporary lights at Wrigley Field, between two teams composed of [[South Bend Blue Sox]] and [[Rockford Peaches]] players versus [[Kenosha Comets]] and [[Racine Belles]] players.

The team had transferred from Decatur, and retained the name \"[[Chicago Staleys|Staleys]]\" for the 1921 season. They renamed themselves the \"Bears\" in order to identify with the baseball team, a common practice in the NFL in those days. Wrigley Field once held the record for the most NFL games played in a single stadium with 365 regular season NFL games, but this record was surpassed in September 2003 by [[Giants Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]], thanks to its dual-occupancy by the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]]. The game played between the Jets and [[2003 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] on September 14, 2003 was the 366th regular season NFL game at Giants Stadium breaking Wrigley's regular season record.<ref name=si>{{cite news |title=The Runaround: Sticking With Ground Game Pays off in Week 2|last=Cross|first=B.

Eventually they acquired a large, portable bleacher section that spanned the right and center field areas and covered most of the existing bleacher seating and part of the right field corner seating. This \"East Stand\" raised Wrigley's football capacity to about 47,000, or a net gain of perhaps 9,000 seats over normal capacity. After the Bears left, this structure would live on for several years as the \"North Stand\" at [[Soldier Field]], until it was replaced by permanent seating.\n\nThe football field ran north-to-south, i.e. from left field to the foul side of first base. The remodeling of the bleachers made for a very tight fit for the gridiron. In fact, the corner of the south end zone was literally in the visiting baseball team's dugout, which was filled with pads for safety, and required a special ground rule that sliced off that corner of the end zone. The end zone was also shorter than the north, as the south end zone was eight yards, compared to the regulation 10 yards.<ref>{{cite web|title=1963 Season: Bears Defeat Colts 10-3 at Wrigley|first=Chet|last=Coppock|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/1963-season-Bears-defeat-Colts-10-3-at-Wrigley/205f934a-533c-49c5-87dc-529c24700560|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003623/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/1963-season-Bears-defeat-Colts-10-3-at-Wrigley/205f934a-533c-49c5-87dc-529c24700560|archive-date=October 5, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One corner of the north end line ran just inches short of the left field wall. There is a legend that [[Bronko Nagurski]], the great Bears fullback, steamrolled through the line, head down, and ran all the way through that end zone, smacking his leather-helmeted head on the bricks. He went back to the bench and told Coach \"Papa Bear\" [[George Halas]], \"That last guy gave me quite a lick!\" That kind of incident prompted the Bears to hang some padding in front of the wall.\n\nThe Bears are second only to the Packers in total NFL championships, and all but one of those (their only [[Super Bowl]] championship) came during their tenure at Wrigley. After a half-century, they found themselves compelled to move, because the NFL wanted every one of its stadiums to seat at least 50,000 as a result of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. The Bears had one experimental game at Dyche Stadium (now [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Ryan Field]]) on the [[Northwestern University]] campus in 1970, but otherwise continued at Wrigley until their transfer to the lakefront ended their five-decades run on the north side. One remnant of the Bears' time at Wrigley was uncovered during the off-season 2007\u20132008 rebuilding of the playing field: the foundations for the goal posts. Five NFL championship games were played at Wrigley Field; [[1933 NFL Championship Game|1933]], [[1937 NFL Championship Game|1937]], [[1941 NFL Championship Game|1941]], [[1943 NFL Championship Game|1943]] and [[1963 NFL Championship Game|1963]]. Coupled with the Chicago Bears, the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League called Wrigley Field home from 1931-1938. Born on the South Side of Chicago, the Cardinals also played their home games at Normal Park, Comiskey Park, and Soldier Field.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wrigley Field November 20, 2010.jpg|right|The Northwestern Wildcats vs. Illinois Fighting Illini football game on 20 November, 2010]] -->\nThe [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern Wildcats]] and the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois Fighting Illini]] played a [[college football]] game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010.

In order to keep the playing field at regulation size, the safety clearances for each end zone to the walls in the field were considerably less than normal.  In particular, the east (right field) end zone came under scrutiny as its end zone was wedged extremely close to the right field wall (as close as one foot in some areas), forcing the goal posts to be hung from the right field wall in order to fit.  Despite extra padding provided in these locations, it was decided that all offensive plays for both teams play to the west end zone, where there was more safety clearance. The east end zone could still be used on defensive and special teams touchdowns, as well as defensive safeties; and, in fact, there was one interception run back for an eastbound touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wildcats, Illini to Use One End Zone at Wrigley|first=Adam|last=Rittenberg|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/BigTen/post/_/id/20006/wildcats-illini-to-use-1-end-zone-at-wrigley|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>  Big Ten Commissioner [[Jim Delany]] said that as late as three days before the game, he had only been apprised that the situation wasn't \"anything other than tight.\"  When he had a chance to fully vet the situation, however, he concluded that the space surrounding the east end zone was smaller than the minimum of six feet stipulated in NCAA rules, and it would have been too great of a risk to allow offensive plays to be run toward that end zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=One End Zone on Offense at Wrigley|first1=Scott|last1=Powers|first2=Adam|last2=Rittenberg|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/ncf/news/story?id=5824661|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 20, 2010|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>  The Fighting Illini won the game 48-27 taking home the Land of Lincoln Trophy, which was introduced in 2009.\n\nNorthwestern Football intends to return to Wrigley Field in 2020, 2022, and 2024.

Field shares its name with the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley Company]], as the park was named for its then-owner, [[William Wrigley Jr.]], the CEO of the Wrigley Company. As early as the 1920s, before the park became officially known as Wrigley Field, the scoreboard was topped by the elf-like \"[[Doublemint]] Twins\", posed as a pitcher and a batter. There were also ads painted on the bare right field wall early in the ballpark's history, prior to the 1923 remodeling which put bleachers there. After that, the Doublemint elves were the only visible in-park advertising. The elves were removed permanently in 1937 when the bleachers and scoreboard were rebuilt. It would be about 44 years before in-park advertising would reappear.\n\nIronically given the roots of its name, Wrigley Field had been a notable exception to the trend of selling [[naming rights|corporate naming rights]] to sporting venues. The [[Tribune Company]], owners of the park from 1981 to 2009, chose not to rename the ballpark, utilizing other ways to bring corporate sponsorship into the ballpark. During the mid-1980s, [[Anheuser-Busch]] placed [[Budweiser]] and [[Bud Light]] advertisements beneath the center field scoreboard. Bud Light became the sponsor of the rebuilt bleachers in 2006.\n\nIn the early 2000s, following the trend of many ballparks, a green-screen [[chroma key]] board was installed behind home plate, in the line of sight of the center field TV camera, to allow electronic \"rotating\" advertisements visible only to the TV audiences. By 2006, the board was set up to allow advertisements to be both physical and electronic (thus they can be seen in both live and replay shots).\n\nIn 2007, the first on-field advertising appeared since the park's early days. Sporting goods firm [[Under Armour]] placed its logo on the double-doors between the ivy on the outfield wall, in left-center and right-center fields. Advertisements were also placed in the dugouts, originally for [[Sears]] department stores, then [[Walter E. Smithe]] furniture and now [[State Farm]] insurance.\n\nFor 2008 and 2009, the Cubs worked out an agreement with the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] to allow the CBOE to auction some 70 box seat season tickets and award naming rights to them.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Cubs, Chicago Board Options Exchange Offer Auction of Cubs Season Tickets|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090303&content_id=3912310&vkey=pr_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2009 season, the Cubs announced that the renovated restaurant space in the southeast corner of Wrigley Field, formerly known as the Friendly Confines Cafe, will be renamed the Captain Morgan Club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Captain Morgan Club to Make Wrigley Field Debut on Opening Day|first=Phil|last=Vettel|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2009/04/captain-morgan-club-to-make-wrigley-field-debut-on-opening-day.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2009, [[Thomas S.

Wrigley Field is famous for its view of the neighborhood buildings across Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In addition to spectators standing or sitting on the apartment roofs, corporate sponsors have frequently taken advantage of those locations as well. In the earliest days of Weeghman Park, one building across Sheffield Avenue advertised a local hangout known as Bismarck Gardens (later called the Marigold Gardens after World War I). That same building has since advertised for the Torco Oil Company, [[Southwest Airlines]], the [[Miller Brewing Company]], and Gilbert's Craft Sausages.\n\nA building across from deep right-center field was topped by a neon sign for [[Baby Ruth]] candy beginning in the mid-1930s and running for some 40 years. That placement by the Chicago-based [[Curtiss Candy Company]], coincidentally positioned in the line of sight of \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot#Legacy and cultural references|Babe Ruth's called shot]]\", proved fortuitous when games began to be televised in the 1940s\u2014the sign was also in the line of sight of the ground level camera behind and to the left of home plate. The aging sign was eventually removed in the early 1970s.\n\nAnother long-standing venue for a sign is the sloping roof of a building behind left-center field. Unsuitable for the bleachers that now decorate many of those buildings, that building's angling roof has been painted in the form of a large billboard since at least the 1940s. In recent years it has borne a bright-red Budweiser sign and, beginning in 2009, an advertisement for Horseshoe Casino. Other buildings have carried signs sponsoring beers, such as Old Style (when it was a Cubs broadcasting sponsor) and Miller; and also [[WGN-TV]], which has telecast Cubs games since April 1948.\n\n====Legacy Partners====\nIn January 2013 the Ricketts family launched \"Legacy Partners,\" a marketing effort to sell new kinds of advertising in and around [[Wrigley Field renovations|renovated Wrigley Field]].

Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, a flag with either a \"W\" or an \"L\" has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result. In case of a doubleheader that is split, both flags are flown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wrigley Field|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/stadium/index?venue=mlb_16|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPast Cubs media guides show that the original flags were blue with a white \"W\" and white with a blue \"L\", the latter coincidentally suggesting \"surrender\". In 1978, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, to further denote wins and losses.\n\nThe flags were replaced in the early 1980s, and the color schemes were reversed with the \"win flag\" being white with a blue W, and the \"loss flag\" the opposite. In 1982, the retired number of Ernie Banks was flying on a foul pole, as white with blue numbers, in 1987, the retired number of Billy Williams joined Banks, the two flags were positioned from the foul poles, Banks from left field, and Williams from right field.  Later on, the team retired numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg, Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux, with Jenkins and Maddux both using the same number (31).\n\nKeeping with tradition, fans are known to bring win flags to home and away games, and displaying them after a Cubs win. Flags are also sold at the ballpark. On April 24, 2008, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying \"10,000\" in blue, along with the win flag, as the 10,000th win in team history was achieved on the road the previous night. Alongside the tradition of the \"W\" and \"L\" flags, the song \"[[Go, Cubs, Go]]\" is sung after each home win (it was also sung by visiting Cubs fans in Game 7 of the [[2016 World Series]] at [[Progressive Field]] in [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]], where the Cubs clinched their first championship since 1908).  Also, following the 2015 addition of the park's [[Daktronics]] video screens, the large \"W\" in the \"Wintrust\" logo on the left field video screen is kept on following Cubs' wins.\n\n===Take Me Out to the Ball Game===\nThe tradition of singing \"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\" at Cubs home games began when Hall of Fame announcer [[Harry Caray]] arrived in 1982 (he had sung it the preceding seven years as a broadcaster for the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]), and it has remained a Wrigley Field staple. After Caray's death, the tradition of a guest conductor began, with former baseball players, other sports stars, actors, and other celebrities invited to sing during the Seventh Inning Stretch. Among the best-known guests have been former Bears coach [[Mike Ditka]], former Cubs second baseman [[Ryne Sandberg]], former pitcher [[Mike Krukow]], former longtime Cubs first baseman [[Mark Grace]], former [[Houston Rockets]] star [[Tracy McGrady]], Chicago Blackhawks forwards [[Jonathan Toews]] and [[Patrick Kane]], Chicago Bears quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]], comedian [[Jay Leno]], [[NASCAR]] driver [[Jeff Gordon]], singers [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Eddie Vedder]], boxer and actor [[Mr. T]], actor and lifelong Cub fan [[Gary Sinise]], actors [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[James Belushi]], [[Bill Murray]], [[WWE]] wrestler/Chicago native [[CM Punk]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and Illinois-native country music singer [[Brett Eldredge]].\n\n===Organ Music===\nWrigley Field was the first Major League ballpark to introduce live [[organ (music)|organ]] music on April 26, 1941.<ref name=DNA>{{cite web |title=Wrigley Field Organist, With 2,500 Games And Counting, Living His Dream |newspaper=Lakeview & Wrigleyville |author=Ariel Cheung |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170830/wrigleyville/wrigley-field-organist-gary-pressy-2500-games-31-years/ |access-date=August 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803194234/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170830/wrigleyville/wrigley-field-organist-gary-pressy-2500-games-31-years/ |archive-date=August 3, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The stadium's first organist was Ray Nelson.<ref name=MAINE>{{cite web|title=Gary Pressy hits all the right chords |newspaper=Maine Campus |author=Leela Stockley|url= https://mainecampus.com/2019/04/this-day-in-history-april-26/}}</ref> As of July 2019, organist [[Gary Pressy]], holds the record for 2,653 consecutive games played; never having missed a day's work in 33 years.<ref name=CUBS>{{cite web|title=Wrigley Field organist breaks Cal Ripken Jr.'s record |website=www.cubshq.com|author=Cole Little|url= https://www.cubshq.com/update/WATCH-Wrigley-Field-organist-breaks-Cal-Ripken-Jrs-record-26528}}</ref> Today, most major league ballparks have replaced the traditional live organist with canned music programmed by a [[DJ]].

This started a chain reaction and more fans began to write their own messages on the wall. The messages were anything from words of support expressed towards the team or just a name. Chalk covered a majority of the wall, to point where fans had to bring step ladders in order to reach upper spaces for their message.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writing on the Wrigley Wall: Latest Way to Celebrate Cubs' World Series Title|first=Paul|last=Sullivan|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-sullivan-wrigley-field-wall-spt-1107-20161106-column.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The Cubs themselves encouraged the event by supplying chalk and adding extra security.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writing On Wrigley Field's Walls|first=Roger|last=Wright|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-wright/writing-on-wrigley-fields_b_12776246.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> The event gained both local and national attention, receiving coverage from [[Fox Sports]] and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cubs Fans Write Heartwarming Messages on Wrigley Field's Brick Walls|first=Dieter|last=Kurtenbach|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/cubs-fans-chalk-wrigley-field-photos-write-103116|work=[[Fox Sports]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cubs Fans Write Their Names in Chalk on Brick Wall of Wrigley Field|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2016/11/03/cubs-fans-write-their-names-chalk-brick-wall-wrigley-field/rzG8cwKpGo3Rgciu5mRgsK/story.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Image:Wrigley Scoreboard.jpg|thumb|175px|The north exterior of Wrigley Field, with manual scoreboard visible, as it appears during the offseason. This picture was taken prior to the outfield bleacher expansion, which brought the bleachers over the sidewalk.]]\n[[File:Waveland Avenue 2009.JPG|thumb|Fans on Waveland Avenue during a 2009 game.]]\nWrigley Field had a brief cameo in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', starring [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Jake and Elwood Blues. In the film, Elwood lists 1060 W. Addison as his fake home address on his Illinois driver's license, tricking the police and later the Illinois Nazis listening on police radio into heading for Wrigley Field. The 1984 film ''[[The Natural]]'', starring [[Robert Redford]], had a scene set at Wrigley but was actually filmed at [[All-High Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. All other baseball action scenes in that movie were shot in Buffalo, at the since-demolished [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]].\n\nDuring Cubs games, fans will often stand outside the park on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home run balls hit over the wall and out of the park. However, as a tradition, Cubs fans inside and sometimes even outside the park will promptly throw any home run ball hit by an opposing player back onto the field of play, a ritual depicted in the 1977 stage play ''[[Bleacher Bums]]'' and in the 1993 film ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]''.\n\nThe ballpark was featured in a scene in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', where the outside marquee read \"''Save Ferris''\". The director, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], originally wanted to film at Comiskey Park (he was a White Sox fan) but the team was out of town during filming. The 2006 film ''[[The Break-Up]]'' used Wrigley Field as the setting for its opening scene. An [[The Babe|early 1990s film about Babe Ruth]] had the obligatory scene in Wrigley Field about the \"called shot\" (the ballpark also doubled as [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] for the film). A scoreboard similar to the one existing in [[1932 World Series|1932]] was used, atop an ivy wall (though that did not exist until later in the decade).\n\nThe ballpark was used for the establishing tryouts scene in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992). This film was a Hollywood account of the 1940s women's baseball league which Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley championed during World War II. [[Garry Marshall]] (older brother of the film's director [[Penny Marshall]]) has a cameo as \"Walter Harvey\", Wrigley's fictional alter ego. The sign behind the scoreboard was temporarily redone to read \"Harvey Field\", and filming was split between Wrigley and Cantigny Park near [[Wheaton, Illinois]].\n\nMany television series have made featured scenes set in Wrigley Field, including ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[Perfect Strangers (sitcom)|Perfect Strangers]]'', ''[[My Boys]]'', and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. Also, the animated comedy ''[[Family Guy]]'' featured a scene at Wrigley Field that parodied the [[Steve Bartman incident]]. In an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled \"[[He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs]]\", upon arriving in Chicago, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] walks past a number of famous Chicago landmarks, including Wrigley Field, followed by a generic-looking stadium bearing the name \"Wherever the White Sox play\". In 2007, the band [[Nine Inch Nails]] created a promotional audio skit, which involved Wrigley Field being the target of disgruntled war veteran's [[terrorist]] attack.<ref>{{cite web |title=Year Zero Research/Proven Leads|url=http://www.ninwiki.com/Year_Zero_Research/Proven_Leads|publisher=NinWiki|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe late-1970s comedy stage play ''[[Bleacher Bums]]'' was set in the right field bleachers at Wrigley. The video of the play was also set on a stage, with bleachers suggesting Wrigley's layout, rather than in the actual ballpark's bleachers. The tradition of throwing opposition home run balls back was explained by [[Dennis Franz]]'s character: \"If someone hands you some garbage, you have to throw it back at them!\"\n\nIn the cartoon series [[Biker Mice From Mars]], the eponymous main characters hide out in the scoreboard of the stadium, which is named Quigley Field.\n\nA dog park in the Wrightwood Neighbors section of [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] is named [[Wiggly Field]] (1997).\n\nThe stadium was also featured on the popular [[Travel Channel]] television show ''[[Great Hotels]]'', starring [[Samantha Brown]]. She attended a game during a visit to Chicago.\n\nChicago folk singer [[Steve Goodman]] featured Wrigley Field as the setting for his popular Cubs lament \"A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request\", extolling both the trials of the Cubs and the place Wrigley Field holds in Cub fans' hearts.  After his untimely death from leukemia, Goodman's ashes were in fact scattered at Wrigley Field as described in the lyrics.\n\nThe [[Statler Brothers]]' 1981 song \"Don't Wait On Me\" referred to a then-implausible situation: \"When the lights go on at Wrigley Field\". However, after [[Wrigley Field#Baseball|lights]] were installed, the line was changed to \"When they put a dome on Wrigley Field\" for their 1989 ''Live-Sold Out'' album.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Chicago First \u2013 Statlers Revise a Hit Tune to Reflect Wrigley Field Reality|first=Jack|last=Hurst|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-08-31/features/8901090203_1_statler-brothers-album-wrigley-field|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=August 31, 1989|accessdate=March 26, 2015|page=14}}</ref>\n\nA few brief shots of Wrigley Field appear in the 1949 movie ''[[It Happens Every Spring]]''. It is also seen on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s show ''[[Life After People]].''\n\nThe stadium made a brief appearance in the open for the first episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', with Conan rushing through the turnstiles while running from New York (where his previous show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', was taped) to Los Angeles (where his new show was taped, until his role as host ended on January 22, 2010) and then running onto the field while being chased by Cubs security. The route O'Brien takes is somewhat misleading, as he is shown running south on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] past the [[Tribune Tower]] before arriving at Wrigley Field, which is well north of the Tribune Tower.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Category 6: Day of Destruction]]'', a terrorist turns off all the electricity at the stadium for a few minutes to demonstrate how hackers could penetrate city electrical systems.\n\nAn overgrown Wrigley Field is shown in the new television series ''Revolution'' (2012).\n\nIn episode 9 of season 3 of ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'' (2015), Wrigley Field makes a short appearance as the home of a fictional soccer team called the ''Chicago Norsemen'' who, according to a banner, were \"1963 Annual Soccer Champions\".\n\nWrigley Field was the site of the final task of ''[[The Amazing Race 29]]'' finale, where one team member was guided by their partner communicating to them from the press box via a one-way radio to place numbers on the hand-turned scoreboard that corresponded to their team's final placement at the end of each of the previous eleven episodes, before searching the stadium's seats for their final clue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/recap/the-amazing-race-season-29-finale/|title=The Amazing Race finale recap: 'We're Going to Victory Lane'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Ray|first=Lincee|date=June 1, 2017|accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the [[Sonic Youth]] live album ''Smart Bar Chicago 85'' the band introduce the final song, 'Making The Nature Scene', as being about 'Tripping on Acid at Wrigley Field'.\n\nThere is a sociologist and demographer called Elizabeth Wrigley-Field who is currently teaching at Columbia University, N.Y.<ref>{{cite web |title=See Her|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~efield|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref> She has her name from her parents (her mother was a Wrigley, her father a Field) but they called her simply Field, so she had to take legal steps to change her name to Wrigley-Field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Baseball Blog|first=Ted|last=Berg|url=http://tedquarters.net/2010/01/07/interview-elizabeth-wrigley-field|work=TedQuarters|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Wrigley Field - panorama - upper deck - 2009-07-29.jpg|900px|align-cap=center| A panoramic view of Wrigley Field from the upper deck prior to 2015 outfield bleacher expansion.}}\n\n==Accessibility and transportation==\n[[Image:Gerald Farinas Addison CTA.jpg|thumb|right|{{cta|Addison|Red}} at Wrigley Field is served by [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]] trains.

As Addison is frequently crowded after games, many fans use {{cta|Sheridan}}, the next station to the north, and still less than a mile from the stadium. \n\nAdditionally, [[Purple Line (CTA)|Purple Line Express]] trains stop at Sheridan before weekday night games in order to provide an additional connection for passengers traveling from [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]] and northern Chicago. After weekday night games, northbound Purple Line passengers are told to board at Sheridan, while southbound passengers are told to board at Addison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/cubs/ballpark/transportation/public-transportation|title=CTA Service to Wrigley Field|publisher=[[Chicago Cubs]]|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of games, the scoreboard operator raises to the top of the center field scoreboard either a white flag with a blue \"W\" to signify a Cubs victory or a blue flag with a white \"L\" for a loss. This is done to show the outcome of the game to passengers on passing \"L\" trains, and also to anyone passing by the park. The basic flag color was once the exact opposite of the colors used today (the rationale being that white is the traditional color for [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]). In addition to rail service, the CTA provides several bus routes which service Wrigley. [[List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes|CTA bus routes]] <code>22 Clark</code>, <code>152 Addison</code> and <code>154 Wrigley Field Express</code> all provide access to the ballpark. Pace also operates the <code>282 Schaumburg-Wrigley Field Express</code> from Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the <code>779 Yorktown-Wrigley Field Express</code> from Yorktown Shopping Center in Lombard. Biking to the field is also a popular alternative. As Halsted, Addison, and Clark streets all have designated biking lanes, getting to the field via bicycle is a widely used way to avoid hectic pre- and postgame traffic; Wrigley Field offers a complimentary bike check program to accommodate for them. Cyclists may check their bikes up to 2 hours before games at the bike racks off of Waveland Ave, and may pick up their bikes up to one hour after games end.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bike Program|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark/bike_program.jsp|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nParking in the area remains scarce, but that does not seem to bother fans who want to come to this baseball mecca, which has drawn more than 3 million fans every year from 2004 until 2011 averaging to a near-sellout every day of the season, even with many weekday afternoon games. The little parking that ''is'' available around the park can go for as much as $100 per space.  To partially alleviate this problem, the Cubs sponsor a parking shuttle service from the nearby DeVry University campus at Belmont and Western as part of their agreement with local neighborhood groups. This was not available during the last World Series prior to 2016, in 1945 against the Detroit Tigers, so<ref>personal knowledge</ref> cars parked as much as a mile away on residential streets and fans walked to Wrigley Field.\n\n==Commemorative stamps==\n[[Image:Wrigley1950composite.JPG|right|thumb|400px]]\nIn 2001, a series of commemorative postage stamps on the subject of baseball parks was issued by the U.S. Postal Service. Most of them were engravings taken from old colorized postcards, including the illustration of Wrigley Field. In the case of Wrigley, the famous scoreboard was sliced off, presumably to hide the original postcard's banner containing the park's name. It may also be observed that the original black-and-white aerial photo, from the 1945 World Series, was taken from nearly the identical spot as the photo of the 1935 Series, allowing a comparison before and after the 1937 alterations to the bleachers. The stamp and its sources also provide a rare look at the center field bleachers filled with spectators, a practice which was later discontinued due to the risk to batters, who might lose the flight of a pitch amidst the white shirts.  This led to the development of [[Batter's eye|darker backgrounds]] to the pitcher's mounds.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball|American football|Chicago}}\n*[[History of Wrigley Field]]\n*[[List of events at Wrigley Field]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*''A Day at the Park'', by William Hartel\n*''Ballparks of North America'', by Michael Benson\n*''Cubs Journal'', by John Snyder\n*''Green Cathedrals'', by Philip J.

It is the home of the [[Chicago Cubs]], one of the city's two [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchises. It first opened in 1914 as '''Weeghman Park''' for [[Charles Weeghman]]'s [[Chicago Whales]] of the [[Federal League]], which folded after the [[1915 in baseball|1915 baseball season]]. The Cubs played their first home game at the park on April 20, [[1916 Chicago Cubs season|1916]], defeating the [[1916 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] with a score of 7\u20136 in 11 innings. Chewing gum magnate [[William Wrigley Jr.]] of the [[Wrigley Company]] acquired complete control of the Cubs in [[1921 Chicago Cubs season|1921]]. It was named '''Cubs Park''' from [[1920 Chicago Cubs season|1920]] to [[1926 Chicago Cubs season|1926]], before being renamed Wrigley Field in [[1927 Chicago Cubs season|1927]].\n\nIn the North Side community area of [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] in the [[Lakeview, Chicago#Wrigleyville|Wrigleyville]] neighborhood, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark]] (west) and [[Addison Street|Addison]] (south) streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed \"The Friendly Confines\", a phrase popularized by \"Mr. Cub\", [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] shortstop and first baseman [[Ernie Banks]]. The oldest park in the [[National League]], the current [[seating capacity]] is 42,495;<ref name=\"2017cap\"/> it is the second-oldest in the majors after [[Fenway Park]] (1912), and the only remaining Federal League park.<ref>[http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_16-fn10p0x66b Focus; Wrigley Field: the Unauthorized Biography], Interview with Stuart Shea, March 9, 2005, [[WILL]] Illinois Public Media, [[American Archive of Public Broadcasting]] (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, D.C., accessed October 3, 2016.</ref>\n\nWrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off [[Lake Michigan]], the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, its location in a primarily residential neighborhood with no parking lots and views from the rooftops behind the outfield, and for being the last Major League park to have lights installed for play after dark, in [[1988 Chicago Cubs season|1988]]. Between [[1921 Chicago Bears season|1921]] and [[1970 Chicago Bears season|1970]], it was the home of the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]], and was also the home of the Chicago Cardinals (now [[Arizona Cardinals]]) of the National Football League from 1931 to 1938.

It is also in those wells, when cross winds are blowing, that balls have a habit of bouncing in all directions. In addition, there is a long chain-link fence strip running the entire length of the outfield wall, the base of which is about two feet down from the top of the wall and the top of which projects out at an angle, primarily used to keep fans from falling out of the bleacher area and onto the field of play, which is about seven to ten feet below the top of the wall.

The rooftops were not seen as \"big business.\" They would later become a popular spectator area during the 1929 World Series. The 1938 World Series brought \"paying\" spectators to the rooftops. Fans sat in lawn chairs and brought their own food and beverages. It was not until the mid 1980s that owners began updating the rooftops with bleacher-style grandstands. The rooftops were also turned into a legitimate business. More businesses began purchasing rooftops around Wrigley Field seeing them as profitable resources. The Sky Box on Sheffield open in 1993. Back then, it catered to corporate groups. Today, it is complete with a two-tier roof deck, indoor clubhouse, fully staffed bars on three levels, and an elevator.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1998, the city required rooftop owners to have a license and began to regulate the venues. In 2003, relations between rooftop owners and the Cubs worsened when the team put up a large screen to block the view of the rooftops. The screens exemplified what is known as a [[spite fence]]. The Cubs then sued most rooftop businesses that year.

The counter was labeled \"AC\", for \"Anno Catulorum\", or \"In the Year of the Cubs\". Prior to the team's 2016 championship, it read AC0871108, with the first two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs' last division championship as of the end of the previous season ([[2008 Chicago Cubs season|2008]]), the next two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs won the National League Pennant ([[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]]), and the last three digits indicating the number of years since their last [[World Series]] win ({{wsy|1908}}).

In the summer, however, or on any warm and breezy day, the wind often comes from the south and the southwest, which means the wind is \"blowing out\" and has the potential to turn normally harmless fly balls into home runs. A third variety is the cross-wind, which typically runs from the left field corner to the right field corner and causes all sorts of havoc. Depending on the direction of the wind, Wrigley can either be one of the friendliest parks in the major leagues for pitchers or among the worst. This makes Wrigley one of the most unpredictable parks in the Major Leagues.\n\nMany Cubs fans check their nearest flag before heading to the park on game days for an indication of what the game might be like; this is less of a factor for night games, however, because the wind does not blow as hard after the sun goes down.\n\nWith the wind blowing ''in'', pitchers can dominate and [[no-hitter]]s have resulted. The last two by a Cubs pitcher occurred near the beginning and the end of the 1972 season, by [[Burt Hooton]] and [[Milt Pappas]] respectively; not until [[Cole Hamels]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] no-hit the Cubs in 2015 would another no-hitter be pitched at Wrigley. In the seventh inning of [[Ken Holtzman]]'s first no-hitter, on August 19, 1969, [[Hank Aaron]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] hit a ball that looked headed for the bleachers, but the wind caught it just enough for left fielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] to leap up and snare it.\n\nWith the wind blowing ''out'', some true tape-measure home runs have been hit by well-muscled batters. [[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Dave Kingman|Dave \"Kong\" Kingman]] broke windows in the apartment buildings across Waveland Avenue several times. [[Glenallen Hill]] put one on a rooftop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Highlight Homers|url=http://www.hittrackeronline.com/historic.php?id=2000_1|publisher=Hittracker Online|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref> Batters have occasionally slugged it into, or to the side of, the first row or two of the \"upper deck\" of the center field bleachers. Sosa hit the roof of the center field camera booth on the fly during the [[2003 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] against the Florida Marlins, some {{convert|450|ft}} away.<ref>{{cite web |title=30 Incredibly Clutch MLB Playoff Moments No One Will Ever Care About|first=Jeffrey|last=Beckmann|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/884658-30-incredibly-clutch-mlb-playoff-moments-no-one-will-ever-care-about#/articles/884658-30-incredibly-clutch-mlb-playoff-moments-no-one-will-ever-care-about/page/18|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=October 14, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBut the longest blast was probably hit by Dave Kingman on a very windy day in 1976 while with the Mets. According to local legend, that day, Kingman launched a bomb that landed on the third porch roof on the east (center field) side of Kenmore Avenue, some 550 feet away.\n\nNo batter has ever hit the center field scoreboard. However, it has been hit by a golf ball hit by [[Sam Snead]] using a two iron.<ref name=\"ballparksmswf\">{{cite web|title=Wrigley Field|url=http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/national/wrigle.htm|publisher=Ballparks.com|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nNo matter the weather, many fans congregate during batting practice and games on Waveland Avenue, behind left field, and Sheffield Avenue, behind right field, for a chance to catch a home run ball.\n\n===Hand-turned scoreboard===\n[[File:Wrigley Field Scoreboard operation.jpg|thumb|right|The scoreboard at Wrigley Field is operated by hand.]]\nAlong with [[Fenway Park]]'s scoreboard and [[Minute Maid Park]] & [[Oracle Park]]'s out of town scoreboards, Wrigley is one of the last parks to maintain a hand-turned scoreboard. Unlike the home of the Red Sox, the scoreboard at Wrigley is mounted above the centerfield bleachers, rather than at ground level, making it harder to hit during play. No players have hit the current scoreboard, although at least three have come close: [[Roberto Clemente]] to the left side, on May 17, 1959;<ref>Pathy, Sam (2017).

A set of light stands facing onto the scoreboard was added in 1988 with the introduction of night games. \nThe centerfield bleacher scoreboard is still manually operated,<ref name=\"75 years\"/> with scores coming in through a computer (a [[ticker tape]] machine was used in the past); a number turner watches the score changes closely and updates scores by manually replacing the numbers from within the scoreboard. The scoreboard is made of sheet steel. The numbers that are placed into the inning windows are also steel, painted forest green, and numbered with white numerals. The box for the game playing at Wrigley uses yellow numerals for the current inning. The clock, which sits at the top center of the scoreboard, has never lost time in its 78-year existence. Standing over the clock are three flagpoles, one for each division in the [[National League]]. There are 15 flags, one for each National League team, and their order on the flagpoles reflects the current standings. The entrance to the scoreboard is a trap-door on the bottom. On the reverse of the scoreboard, visible from the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] elevated trains, is a blue pennant, with the words \"''Chicago Cubs''\", in white outlined in red neon. The scoreboard was extensively rehabilitated for the 2010 season.\n\nIn 2010, the Cubs toyed with the idea of adding a video screen to the stadium, but the hand-turned scoreboard cannot be moved due to the park's landmark status. The landmark status also prohibits even simple facelifts such as adding two more games on either side (there are 15 teams in both the National and American leagues) of the 12-game, 24-team scoreboard (reflecting MLB from 1969 to 1976), so up to three games (1 NL, 1 AL, and the interleague) each day cannot be posted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wrigley Field Getting a Jumbotron?|first=Tab|last=Bamford|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/364514-wrigley-field-getting-a-jumbotron|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=March 15, 2011|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref> Those games may eventually be part of the auxiliary video board currently on the right field that may also be added in left field.

A [[Budweiser]] Beer slogan was on the lower panel in the early 1980s about the time when the team added the LED signage. Past and present owners of the park have used the marquee in some way as the park's trademark of sorts: the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] Addison street platform that serves Wrigley Field uses an image of the marquee, painted on walls to announce the destination.

This would have allowed the Wrigley Field-hosted (i.e. daytime) games to be held over the weekend. In return, only one [[prime time]] game (Game 3 on Friday) would have been lost. Wrigley Field wouldn't have lights installed until [[1988 Chicago Cubs season|four years later]]. To put things in proper perspective, had the Cubs advanced to the Series instead of the Padres, the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] would have hosted Games 1\u20132, and 6\u20137 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3\u20135 (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time zone|Central Time]]. Since the Padres wound up winning the 1984 NLCS, these plans proved moot. \n\nAfter 5,687 consecutive day games played by the Cubs at Wrigley, the lights were finally lit on August 8, 1988, for a game with the Philadelphia Phillies. That game was rained out after 3\u00bd innings,<ref name=\"lights\" /> and the first official night game took place the following evening against the New York Mets, a game which the Cubs won 6\u20134.<ref name=\"lights\" />\n\nThe [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]'s first All-Star Game during the 1943 midseason, was played under temporary lights at Wrigley Field, between two teams composed of [[South Bend Blue Sox]] and [[Rockford Peaches]] players versus [[Kenosha Comets]] and [[Racine Belles]] players.

Wrigley Field once held the record for the most NFL games played in a single stadium with 365 regular season NFL games, but this record was surpassed in September 2003 by [[Giants Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]], thanks to its dual-occupancy by the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]]. The game played between the Jets and [[2003 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] on September 14, 2003 was the 366th regular season NFL game at Giants Stadium breaking Wrigley's regular season record.<ref name=si>{{cite news |title=The Runaround: Sticking With Ground Game Pays off in Week 2|last=Cross|first=B.

Eventually they acquired a large, portable bleacher section that spanned the right and center field areas and covered most of the existing bleacher seating and part of the right field corner seating. This \"East Stand\" raised Wrigley's football capacity to about 47,000, or a net gain of perhaps 9,000 seats over normal capacity. After the Bears left, this structure would live on for several years as the \"North Stand\" at [[Soldier Field]], until it was replaced by permanent seating.\n\nThe football field ran north-to-south, i.e. from left field to the foul side of first base. The remodeling of the bleachers made for a very tight fit for the gridiron. In fact, the corner of the south end zone was literally in the visiting baseball team's dugout, which was filled with pads for safety, and required a special ground rule that sliced off that corner of the end zone. The end zone was also shorter than the north, as the south end zone was eight yards, compared to the regulation 10 yards.<ref>{{cite web|title=1963 Season: Bears Defeat Colts 10-3 at Wrigley|first=Chet|last=Coppock|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/1963-season-Bears-defeat-Colts-10-3-at-Wrigley/205f934a-533c-49c5-87dc-529c24700560|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003623/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/1963-season-Bears-defeat-Colts-10-3-at-Wrigley/205f934a-533c-49c5-87dc-529c24700560|archive-date=October 5, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One corner of the north end line ran just inches short of the left field wall. There is a legend that [[Bronko Nagurski]], the great Bears fullback, steamrolled through the line, head down, and ran all the way through that end zone, smacking his leather-helmeted head on the bricks. He went back to the bench and told Coach \"Papa Bear\" [[George Halas]], \"That last guy gave me quite a lick!\" That kind of incident prompted the Bears to hang some padding in front of the wall.\n\nThe Bears are second only to the Packers in total NFL championships, and all but one of those (their only [[Super Bowl]] championship) came during their tenure at Wrigley. After a half-century, they found themselves compelled to move, because the NFL wanted every one of its stadiums to seat at least 50,000 as a result of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. The Bears had one experimental game at Dyche Stadium (now [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Ryan Field]]) on the [[Northwestern University]] campus in 1970, but otherwise continued at Wrigley until their transfer to the lakefront ended their five-decades run on the north side. One remnant of the Bears' time at Wrigley was uncovered during the off-season 2007\u20132008 rebuilding of the playing field: the foundations for the goal posts. Five NFL championship games were played at Wrigley Field; [[1933 NFL Championship Game|1933]], [[1937 NFL Championship Game|1937]], [[1941 NFL Championship Game|1941]], [[1943 NFL Championship Game|1943]] and [[1963 NFL Championship Game|1963]]. Coupled with the Chicago Bears, the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League called Wrigley Field home from 1931-1938. Born on the South Side of Chicago, the Cardinals also played their home games at Normal Park, Comiskey Park, and Soldier Field.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wrigley Field November 20, 2010.jpg|right|The Northwestern Wildcats vs. Illinois Fighting Illini football game on 20 November, 2010]] -->\nThe [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern Wildcats]] and the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois Fighting Illini]] played a [[college football]] game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010.

In order to keep the playing field at regulation size, the safety clearances for each end zone to the walls in the field were considerably less than normal.  In particular, the east (right field) end zone came under scrutiny as its end zone was wedged extremely close to the right field wall (as close as one foot in some areas), forcing the goal posts to be hung from the right field wall in order to fit.  Despite extra padding provided in these locations, it was decided that all offensive plays for both teams play to the west end zone, where there was more safety clearance. The east end zone could still be used on defensive and special teams touchdowns, as well as defensive safeties; and, in fact, there was one interception run back for an eastbound touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wildcats, Illini to Use One End Zone at Wrigley|first=Adam|last=Rittenberg|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/BigTen/post/_/id/20006/wildcats-illini-to-use-1-end-zone-at-wrigley|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>  Big Ten Commissioner [[Jim Delany]] said that as late as three days before the game, he had only been apprised that the situation wasn't \"anything other than tight.\"  When he had a chance to fully vet the situation, however, he concluded that the space surrounding the east end zone was smaller than the minimum of six feet stipulated in NCAA rules, and it would have been too great of a risk to allow offensive plays to be run toward that end zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=One End Zone on Offense at Wrigley|first1=Scott|last1=Powers|first2=Adam|last2=Rittenberg|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/ncf/news/story?id=5824661|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 20, 2010|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>  The Fighting Illini won the game 48-27 taking home the Land of Lincoln Trophy, which was introduced in 2009.\n\nNorthwestern Football intends to return to Wrigley Field in 2020, 2022, and 2024.

Field shares its name with the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley Company]], as the park was named for its then-owner, [[William Wrigley Jr.]], the CEO of the Wrigley Company. As early as the 1920s, before the park became officially known as Wrigley Field, the scoreboard was topped by the elf-like \"[[Doublemint]] Twins\", posed as a pitcher and a batter. There were also ads painted on the bare right field wall early in the ballpark's history, prior to the 1923 remodeling which put bleachers there. After that, the Doublemint elves were the only visible in-park advertising. The elves were removed permanently in 1937 when the bleachers and scoreboard were rebuilt. It would be about 44 years before in-park advertising would reappear.\n\nIronically given the roots of its name, Wrigley Field had been a notable exception to the trend of selling [[naming rights|corporate naming rights]] to sporting venues. The [[Tribune Company]], owners of the park from 1981 to 2009, chose not to rename the ballpark, utilizing other ways to bring corporate sponsorship into the ballpark. During the mid-1980s, [[Anheuser-Busch]] placed [[Budweiser]] and [[Bud Light]] advertisements beneath the center field scoreboard. Bud Light became the sponsor of the rebuilt bleachers in 2006.\n\nIn the early 2000s, following the trend of many ballparks, a green-screen [[chroma key]] board was installed behind home plate, in the line of sight of the center field TV camera, to allow electronic \"rotating\" advertisements visible only to the TV audiences. By 2006, the board was set up to allow advertisements to be both physical and electronic (thus they can be seen in both live and replay shots).\n\nIn 2007, the first on-field advertising appeared since the park's early days. Sporting goods firm [[Under Armour]] placed its logo on the double-doors between the ivy on the outfield wall, in left-center and right-center fields. Advertisements were also placed in the dugouts, originally for [[Sears]] department stores, then [[Walter E. Smithe]] furniture and now [[State Farm]] insurance.\n\nFor 2008 and 2009, the Cubs worked out an agreement with the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] to allow the CBOE to auction some 70 box seat season tickets and award naming rights to them.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Cubs, Chicago Board Options Exchange Offer Auction of Cubs Season Tickets|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090303&content_id=3912310&vkey=pr_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2009 season, the Cubs announced that the renovated restaurant space in the southeast corner of Wrigley Field, formerly known as the Friendly Confines Cafe, will be renamed the Captain Morgan Club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Captain Morgan Club to Make Wrigley Field Debut on Opening Day|first=Phil|last=Vettel|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2009/04/captain-morgan-club-to-make-wrigley-field-debut-on-opening-day.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2009, [[Thomas S. Ricketts]] officially took over 95% ownership of the [[Chicago Cubs]], Wrigley Field and 20% ownership of [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]]. The Tribune will retain 5% ownership.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cubs Sale to Ricketts Is Complete|url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2009/10/cubs-sale-to-ricketts-is-complete.html|work=Chicago Breaking Sports|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref> Ricketts, however, has expressed no interest in selling the naming rights to Wrigley Field, preferring that it retain the name it has used since 1926.\n\n====Outside venues====\nCorporate sponsorship has not been limited to the park itself. Wrigley Field is famous for its view of the neighborhood buildings across Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In addition to spectators standing or sitting on the apartment roofs, corporate sponsors have frequently taken advantage of those locations as well. In the earliest days of Weeghman Park, one building across Sheffield Avenue advertised a local hangout known as Bismarck Gardens (later called the Marigold Gardens after World War I). That same building has since advertised for the Torco Oil Company, [[Southwest Airlines]], the [[Miller Brewing Company]], and Gilbert's Craft Sausages.\n\nA building across from deep right-center field was topped by a neon sign for [[Baby Ruth]] candy beginning in the mid-1930s and running for some 40 years. That placement by the Chicago-based [[Curtiss Candy Company]], coincidentally positioned in the line of sight of \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot#Legacy and cultural references|Babe Ruth's called shot]]\", proved fortuitous when games began to be televised in the 1940s\u2014the sign was also in the line of sight of the ground level camera behind and to the left of home plate. The aging sign was eventually removed in the early 1970s.\n\nAnother long-standing venue for a sign is the sloping roof of a building behind left-center field. Unsuitable for the bleachers that now decorate many of those buildings, that building's angling roof has been painted in the form of a large billboard since at least the 1940s. In recent years it has borne a bright-red Budweiser sign and, beginning in 2009, an advertisement for Horseshoe Casino. Other buildings have carried signs sponsoring beers, such as Old Style (when it was a Cubs broadcasting sponsor) and Miller; and also [[WGN-TV]], which has telecast Cubs games since April 1948.\n\n====Legacy Partners====\nIn January 2013 the Ricketts family launched \"Legacy Partners,\" a marketing effort to sell new kinds of advertising in and around [[Wrigley Field renovations|renovated Wrigley Field]]. In conjunction with the new W Partners,<ref>{{cite news |title=Hayward leaving Cubs for joint venture with Ricketts family|first=Phil|last=Rogers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-31/sports/chi-cubs-marketing-chief-hayward-20130131_1_hayward-cubs-chairman-tom-ricketts-joint-venture|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref> the Cubs entered into 10-year agreements with its largest advertisers.\n# \u2013 [[Anheuser-Busch]]\n# \u2013 [[Starwood Hotels]], \"Official Hotel of the Chicago Cubs\" and a new hotel to be developed across the street from Wrigley Field.\n# \u2013 [[Under Armour]]<ref>{{cite press release |title=Performance Brand Elevates Partnership to Become Legacy Partner of Cubs Organization|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20140226&content_id=68359682&vkey=pr_chc&c_id=chc|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=February 26, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref>\n# \u2013 [[ATI Physical Therapy]], a national Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation organization<ref>{{cite web |title=Cubs Add 4th Top-Tier Sponsor in ATI Physical Therapy|first=Danny|last=Ecker|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20141010/BLOGS04/141019985/cubs-add-4th-top-tier-sponsor-in-ati-physical-therapy|work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref>\n# \u2013 [[CIVC Partners|Wintrust Financial Corporation]], a Chicago-based regional bank holding company<ref>{{cite web |title=Wintrust Financial Corp.

Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, a flag with either a \"W\" or an \"L\" has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result. In case of a doubleheader that is split, both flags are flown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wrigley Field|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/stadium/index?venue=mlb_16|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPast Cubs media guides show that the original flags were blue with a white \"W\" and white with a blue \"L\", the latter coincidentally suggesting \"surrender\". In 1978, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, to further denote wins and losses.\n\nThe flags were replaced in the early 1980s, and the color schemes were reversed with the \"win flag\" being white with a blue W, and the \"loss flag\" the opposite. In 1982, the retired number of Ernie Banks was flying on a foul pole, as white with blue numbers, in 1987, the retired number of Billy Williams joined Banks, the two flags were positioned from the foul poles, Banks from left field, and Williams from right field.  Later on, the team retired numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg, Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux, with Jenkins and Maddux both using the same number (31).\n\nKeeping with tradition, fans are known to bring win flags to home and away games, and displaying them after a Cubs win. Flags are also sold at the ballpark. On April 24, 2008, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying \"10,000\" in blue, along with the win flag, as the 10,000th win in team history was achieved on the road the previous night. Alongside the tradition of the \"W\" and \"L\" flags, the song \"[[Go, Cubs, Go]]\" is sung after each home win (it was also sung by visiting Cubs fans in Game 7 of the [[2016 World Series]] at [[Progressive Field]] in [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]], where the Cubs clinched their first championship since 1908).  Also, following the 2015 addition of the park's [[Daktronics]] video screens, the large \"W\" in the \"Wintrust\" logo on the left field video screen is kept on following Cubs' wins.\n\n===Take Me Out to the Ball Game===\nThe tradition of singing \"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\" at Cubs home games began when Hall of Fame announcer [[Harry Caray]] arrived in 1982 (he had sung it the preceding seven years as a broadcaster for the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]), and it has remained a Wrigley Field staple. After Caray's death, the tradition of a guest conductor began, with former baseball players, other sports stars, actors, and other celebrities invited to sing during the Seventh Inning Stretch. Among the best-known guests have been former Bears coach [[Mike Ditka]], former Cubs second baseman [[Ryne Sandberg]], former pitcher [[Mike Krukow]], former longtime Cubs first baseman [[Mark Grace]], former [[Houston Rockets]] star [[Tracy McGrady]], Chicago Blackhawks forwards [[Jonathan Toews]] and [[Patrick Kane]], Chicago Bears quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]], comedian [[Jay Leno]], [[NASCAR]] driver [[Jeff Gordon]], singers [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Eddie Vedder]], boxer and actor [[Mr. T]], actor and lifelong Cub fan [[Gary Sinise]], actors [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[James Belushi]], [[Bill Murray]], [[WWE]] wrestler/Chicago native [[CM Punk]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and Illinois-native country music singer [[Brett Eldredge]].\n\n===Organ Music===\nWrigley Field was the first Major League ballpark to introduce live [[organ (music)|organ]] music on April 26, 1941.<ref name=DNA>{{cite web |title=Wrigley Field Organist, With 2,500 Games And Counting, Living His Dream |newspaper=Lakeview & Wrigleyville |author=Ariel Cheung |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170830/wrigleyville/wrigley-field-organist-gary-pressy-2500-games-31-years/ |access-date=August 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803194234/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170830/wrigleyville/wrigley-field-organist-gary-pressy-2500-games-31-years/ |archive-date=August 3, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The stadium's first organist was Ray Nelson.<ref name=MAINE>{{cite web|title=Gary Pressy hits all the right chords |newspaper=Maine Campus |author=Leela Stockley|url= https://mainecampus.com/2019/04/this-day-in-history-april-26/}}</ref> As of July 2019, organist [[Gary Pressy]], holds the record for 2,653 consecutive games played; never having missed a day's work in 33 years.<ref name=CUBS>{{cite web|title=Wrigley Field organist breaks Cal Ripken Jr.'s record |website=www.cubshq.com|author=Cole Little|url= https://www.cubshq.com/update/WATCH-Wrigley-Field-organist-breaks-Cal-Ripken-Jrs-record-26528}}</ref> Today, most major league ballparks have replaced the traditional live organist with canned music programmed by a [[DJ]].

This started a chain reaction and more fans began to write their own messages on the wall. The messages were anything from words of support expressed towards the team or just a name. Chalk covered a majority of the wall, to point where fans had to bring step ladders in order to reach upper spaces for their message.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writing on the Wrigley Wall: Latest Way to Celebrate Cubs' World Series Title|first=Paul|last=Sullivan|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-sullivan-wrigley-field-wall-spt-1107-20161106-column.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The Cubs themselves encouraged the event by supplying chalk and adding extra security.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writing On Wrigley Field's Walls|first=Roger|last=Wright|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-wright/writing-on-wrigley-fields_b_12776246.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> The event gained both local and national attention, receiving coverage from [[Fox Sports]] and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cubs Fans Write Heartwarming Messages on Wrigley Field's Brick Walls|first=Dieter|last=Kurtenbach|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/cubs-fans-chalk-wrigley-field-photos-write-103116|work=[[Fox Sports]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cubs Fans Write Their Names in Chalk on Brick Wall of Wrigley Field|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2016/11/03/cubs-fans-write-their-names-chalk-brick-wall-wrigley-field/rzG8cwKpGo3Rgciu5mRgsK/story.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Image:Wrigley Scoreboard.jpg|thumb|175px|The north exterior of Wrigley Field, with manual scoreboard visible, as it appears during the offseason. This picture was taken prior to the outfield bleacher expansion, which brought the bleachers over the sidewalk.]]\n[[File:Waveland Avenue 2009.JPG|thumb|Fans on Waveland Avenue during a 2009 game.]]\nWrigley Field had a brief cameo in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', starring [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Jake and Elwood Blues. In the film, Elwood lists 1060 W. Addison as his fake home address on his Illinois driver's license, tricking the police and later the Illinois Nazis listening on police radio into heading for Wrigley Field. The 1984 film ''[[The Natural]]'', starring [[Robert Redford]], had a scene set at Wrigley but was actually filmed at [[All-High Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. All other baseball action scenes in that movie were shot in Buffalo, at the since-demolished [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]].\n\nDuring Cubs games, fans will often stand outside the park on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home run balls hit over the wall and out of the park. However, as a tradition, Cubs fans inside and sometimes even outside the park will promptly throw any home run ball hit by an opposing player back onto the field of play, a ritual depicted in the 1977 stage play ''[[Bleacher Bums]]'' and in the 1993 film ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]''.\n\nThe ballpark was featured in a scene in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', where the outside marquee read \"''Save Ferris''\". The director, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], originally wanted to film at Comiskey Park (he was a White Sox fan) but the team was out of town during filming. The 2006 film ''[[The Break-Up]]'' used Wrigley Field as the setting for its opening scene. An [[The Babe|early 1990s film about Babe Ruth]] had the obligatory scene in Wrigley Field about the \"called shot\" (the ballpark also doubled as [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] for the film). A scoreboard similar to the one existing in [[1932 World Series|1932]] was used, atop an ivy wall (though that did not exist until later in the decade).\n\nThe ballpark was used for the establishing tryouts scene in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992). This film was a Hollywood account of the 1940s women's baseball league which Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley championed during World War II. [[Garry Marshall]] (older brother of the film's director [[Penny Marshall]]) has a cameo as \"Walter Harvey\", Wrigley's fictional alter ego. The sign behind the scoreboard was temporarily redone to read \"Harvey Field\", and filming was split between Wrigley and Cantigny Park near [[Wheaton, Illinois]].\n\nMany television series have made featured scenes set in Wrigley Field, including ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[Perfect Strangers (sitcom)|Perfect Strangers]]'', ''[[My Boys]]'', and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. Also, the animated comedy ''[[Family Guy]]'' featured a scene at Wrigley Field that parodied the [[Steve Bartman incident]]. In an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled \"[[He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs]]\", upon arriving in Chicago, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] walks past a number of famous Chicago landmarks, including Wrigley Field, followed by a generic-looking stadium bearing the name \"Wherever the White Sox play\". In 2007, the band [[Nine Inch Nails]] created a promotional audio skit, which involved Wrigley Field being the target of disgruntled war veteran's [[terrorist]] attack.<ref>{{cite web |title=Year Zero Research/Proven Leads|url=http://www.ninwiki.com/Year_Zero_Research/Proven_Leads|publisher=NinWiki|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe late-1970s comedy stage play ''[[Bleacher Bums]]'' was set in the right field bleachers at Wrigley. The video of the play was also set on a stage, with bleachers suggesting Wrigley's layout, rather than in the actual ballpark's bleachers. The tradition of throwing opposition home run balls back was explained by [[Dennis Franz]]'s character: \"If someone hands you some garbage, you have to throw it back at them!\"\n\nIn the cartoon series [[Biker Mice From Mars]], the eponymous main characters hide out in the scoreboard of the stadium, which is named Quigley Field.\n\nA dog park in the Wrightwood Neighbors section of [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] is named [[Wiggly Field]] (1997).\n\nThe stadium was also featured on the popular [[Travel Channel]] television show ''[[Great Hotels]]'', starring [[Samantha Brown]]. She attended a game during a visit to Chicago.\n\nChicago folk singer [[Steve Goodman]] featured Wrigley Field as the setting for his popular Cubs lament \"A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request\", extolling both the trials of the Cubs and the place Wrigley Field holds in Cub fans' hearts.  After his untimely death from leukemia, Goodman's ashes were in fact scattered at Wrigley Field as described in the lyrics.\n\nThe [[Statler Brothers]]' 1981 song \"Don't Wait On Me\" referred to a then-implausible situation: \"When the lights go on at Wrigley Field\". However, after [[Wrigley Field#Baseball|lights]] were installed, the line was changed to \"When they put a dome on Wrigley Field\" for their 1989 ''Live-Sold Out'' album.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Chicago First \u2013 Statlers Revise a Hit Tune to Reflect Wrigley Field Reality|first=Jack|last=Hurst|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-08-31/features/8901090203_1_statler-brothers-album-wrigley-field|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=August 31, 1989|accessdate=March 26, 2015|page=14}}</ref>\n\nA few brief shots of Wrigley Field appear in the 1949 movie ''[[It Happens Every Spring]]''. It is also seen on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s show ''[[Life After People]].''\n\nThe stadium made a brief appearance in the open for the first episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', with Conan rushing through the turnstiles while running from New York (where his previous show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', was taped) to Los Angeles (where his new show was taped, until his role as host ended on January 22, 2010) and then running onto the field while being chased by Cubs security. The route O'Brien takes is somewhat misleading, as he is shown running south on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] past the [[Tribune Tower]] before arriving at Wrigley Field, which is well north of the Tribune Tower.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Category 6: Day of Destruction]]'', a terrorist turns off all the electricity at the stadium for a few minutes to demonstrate how hackers could penetrate city electrical systems.\n\nAn overgrown Wrigley Field is shown in the new television series ''Revolution'' (2012).\n\nIn episode 9 of season 3 of ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'' (2015), Wrigley Field makes a short appearance as the home of a fictional soccer team called the ''Chicago Norsemen'' who, according to a banner, were \"1963 Annual Soccer Champions\".\n\nWrigley Field was the site of the final task of ''[[The Amazing Race 29]]'' finale, where one team member was guided by their partner communicating to them from the press box via a one-way radio to place numbers on the hand-turned scoreboard that corresponded to their team's final placement at the end of each of the previous eleven episodes, before searching the stadium's seats for their final clue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/recap/the-amazing-race-season-29-finale/|title=The Amazing Race finale recap: 'We're Going to Victory Lane'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Ray|first=Lincee|date=June 1, 2017|accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the [[Sonic Youth]] live album ''Smart Bar Chicago 85'' the band introduce the final song, 'Making The Nature Scene', as being about 'Tripping on Acid at Wrigley Field'.\n\nThere is a sociologist and demographer called Elizabeth Wrigley-Field who is currently teaching at Columbia University, N.Y.<ref>{{cite web |title=See Her|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~efield|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref> She has her name from her parents (her mother was a Wrigley, her father a Field) but they called her simply Field, so she had to take legal steps to change her name to Wrigley-Field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Baseball Blog|first=Ted|last=Berg|url=http://tedquarters.net/2010/01/07/interview-elizabeth-wrigley-field|work=TedQuarters|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Wrigley Field - panorama - upper deck - 2009-07-29.jpg|900px|align-cap=center| A panoramic view of Wrigley Field from the upper deck prior to 2015 outfield bleacher expansion.}}\n\n==Accessibility and transportation==\n[[Image:Gerald Farinas Addison CTA.jpg|thumb|right|{{cta|Addison|Red}} at Wrigley Field is served by [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]] trains. This view is now blocked by buildings constructed in 2007.]]\nThe [[Chicago \"L\"]] [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]] stop at {{cta|Addison|Red}} is less than one block east of Wrigley Field; the stadium was originally built for proximity to the \"L\" tracks. As Addison is frequently crowded after games, many fans use {{cta|Sheridan}}, the next station to the north, and still less than a mile from the stadium. \n\nAdditionally, [[Purple Line (CTA)|Purple Line Express]] trains stop at Sheridan before weekday night games in order to provide an additional connection for passengers traveling from [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]] and northern Chicago. After weekday night games, northbound Purple Line passengers are told to board at Sheridan, while southbound passengers are told to board at Addison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/cubs/ballpark/transportation/public-transportation|title=CTA Service to Wrigley Field|publisher=[[Chicago Cubs]]|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of games, the scoreboard operator raises to the top of the center field scoreboard either a white flag with a blue \"W\" to signify a Cubs victory or a blue flag with a white \"L\" for a loss. This is done to show the outcome of the game to passengers on passing \"L\" trains, and also to anyone passing by the park. The basic flag color was once the exact opposite of the colors used today (the rationale being that white is the traditional color for [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]). In addition to rail service, the CTA provides several bus routes which service Wrigley. [[List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes|CTA bus routes]] <code>22 Clark</code>, <code>152 Addison</code> and <code>154 Wrigley Field Express</code> all provide access to the ballpark. Pace also operates the <code>282 Schaumburg-Wrigley Field Express</code> from Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the <code>779 Yorktown-Wrigley Field Express</code> from Yorktown Shopping Center in Lombard. Biking to the field is also a popular alternative. As Halsted, Addison, and Clark streets all have designated biking lanes, getting to the field via bicycle is a widely used way to avoid hectic pre- and postgame traffic; Wrigley Field offers a complimentary bike check program to accommodate for them. Cyclists may check their bikes up to 2 hours before games at the bike racks off of Waveland Ave, and may pick up their bikes up to one hour after games end.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bike Program|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark/bike_program.jsp|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nParking in the area remains scarce, but that does not seem to bother fans who want to come to this baseball mecca, which has drawn more than 3 million fans every year from 2004 until 2011 averaging to a near-sellout every day of the season, even with many weekday afternoon games. The little parking that ''is'' available around the park can go for as much as $100 per space.  To partially alleviate this problem, the Cubs sponsor a parking shuttle service from the nearby DeVry University campus at Belmont and Western as part of their agreement with local neighborhood groups. This was not available during the last World Series prior to 2016, in 1945 against the Detroit Tigers, so<ref>personal knowledge</ref> cars parked as much as a mile away on residential streets and fans walked to Wrigley Field.\n\n==Commemorative stamps==\n[[Image:Wrigley1950composite.JPG|right|thumb|400px]]\nIn 2001, a series of commemorative postage stamps on the subject of baseball parks was issued by the U.S. Postal Service. Most of them were engravings taken from old colorized postcards, including the illustration of Wrigley Field. In the case of Wrigley, the famous scoreboard was sliced off, presumably to hide the original postcard's banner containing the park's name. It may also be observed that the original black-and-white aerial photo, from the 1945 World Series, was taken from nearly the identical spot as the photo of the 1935 Series, allowing a comparison before and after the 1937 alterations to the bleachers. The stamp and its sources also provide a rare look at the center field bleachers filled with spectators, a practice which was later discontinued due to the risk to batters, who might lose the flight of a pitch amidst the white shirts.  This led to the development of [[Batter's eye|darker backgrounds]] to the pitcher's mounds.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball|American football|Chicago}}\n*[[History of Wrigley Field]]\n*[[List of events at Wrigley Field]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*''A Day at the Park'', by William Hartel\n*''Ballparks of North America'', by Michael Benson\n*''Cubs Journal'', by John Snyder\n*''Green Cathedrals'', by Philip J.
