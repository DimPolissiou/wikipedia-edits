It is analogous to the German ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (literally, theory of science) which was introduced by philosophers [[Johann Fichte]] and [[Bernard Bolzano]] in the late 18th century. The word first appeared in English in 1847 as a translation of the German in New York's ''Eclectic Magazine'' review of a philosophical novel by German author [[Jean Paul]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |chapter=Epistemology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = anonymous| title=Jean-Paul Frederich Richter |journal=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science and Art |date=Nov 1847 |volume=12 |page=317 | hdl=2027/iau.31858055206621 }}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The title of one of the principal works of Fichte is \u2032Wissenschaftslehre,\u2032 which, after the analogy of ''technology'' ... we render ''epistemology''.}}\n\nIt was properly introduced in the philosophical literature by Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in his ''Institutes of Metaphysics'' (1854):<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferrier |first1=James Frederick |title=Institutes of metaphysic : the theory of knowing and being |date=1854 |publisher=W.

E.g., [[\u00c9mile Meyerson]] opened his ''Identity and Reality'', written in 1908, with the remark that the word 'is becoming current' as equivalent to 'the philosophy of the sciences.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyerson |first1=\u00c9mile |title=Identit\u00e9 et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 |date=1908 |publisher=F.

[[John Locke]] describes his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) as an inquiry \"into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223061 |date=1689 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> According to Brett Warren, the character ''Epistemon'' in [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]]'s ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1591) \"was meant to be a personification of a philosophical concept currently known as 'epistemology': the investigation into the differences of a justified belief versus its opinion.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=King James|first2=Brett|last2=Warren|title=The Annotated Daemonologie.

Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between [[Propositional knowledge|\"knowing that\"]] (know a concept), [[Know-how|\"knowing how\"]] (understand an operation), and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|\"acquaintance-knowledge\"]] (know by relation), with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these.<ref>John Bengson (Editor), Marc A. Moffett (Editor): Essays on Knowledge, Mind, and Action. New York: Oxford University Press. 2011</ref>\n\nWhile these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are defined explicitly in other languages (N.B. some languages related to English have been said to retain these verbs, e.g. [[Scots language|Scots]]: {{lang|sco|wit}} and {{lang|sco|[[wikt:ken#Scots|ken]]}}). In French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch 'to know (a person)' is translated using {{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, {{lang|pt|conhecer}}, {{lang|es|conocer}} and {{lang|de|kennen}} (both German and Dutch) respectively, whereas 'to know (how to do something)' is translated using {{lang|fr|savoir}}, {{lang|es|saber}} (both Portuguese and Spanish), {{lang|de|wissen}}, and {{lang|nl|weten}}. Modern Greek has the verbs {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|gnor\u00edzo}}) and {{lang|el|\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ks\u00e9ro}}). Italian has the verbs {{lang|it|conoscere}} and {{lang|it|sapere}} and the nouns for 'knowledge' are {{lang|it|conoscenza}} and {{lang|it|sapienza}}. German has the verbs {{lang|de|wissen}} and {{lang|de|kennen}}; the former implies knowing a fact, the latter knowing in the sense of being acquainted with and having a working knowledge of; there is also a noun derived from {{lang|de|kennen}}, namely {{lang|de|Erkennen}}, which has been said to imply knowledge in the form of recognition or acknowledgment.<ref>For related linguistic data, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Epistemology Personalized |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2017 |volume=67 |issue=269 |pages=813\u2013834 |doi=10.1093/pq/pqx020 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BENEP-3 }}, esp. Section 1.</ref> The verb itself implies a process: you have to go from one state to another, from a state of \"not-{{lang|de|erkennen}}\" to a state of true {{lang|de|erkennen}}. This verb seems the most appropriate in terms of describing the \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence the German name \"{{lang|de|[[:de:Erkenntnistheorie|Erkenntnistheorie]]}}\". The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.\n\nIn his paper ''On Denoting'' and his later book ''Problems of Philosophy'' [[Bertrand Russell]] stressed the distinction between \"[[knowledge by description]]\" and \"[[knowledge by acquaintance]].\" [[Gilbert Ryle]] is also credited with stressing the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in ''[[The Concept of Mind]].'' In ''Personal Knowledge,'' [[Michael Polanyi]] argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a [[bicycle]], he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the [[physics]] involved in maintaining a state of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Balance|balance]] cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to [[infinite regress]].\n\nIn recent times, epistemologists including [[Ernest Sosa|Sosa]], [[John Greco (philosopher)|Greco]], [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kvanvig |first1=Jonathan L. |title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139442282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILTIEjvbeLoC |language=en}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski]] and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate people's \"properties\" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Belief===\n{{Main|Belief}}\nIn common speech, a \"statement of belief\" is typically an expression of faith or trust in a person, power, or other entity. While it includes such traditional views, epistemology is also concerned with what we believe. This includes 'the truth' and everything else we accept as 'true' for ourselves from a cognitive point of view.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Truth===\n{{Main|Truth}}\n{{See also|Criteria of truth}}\nWhether someone's belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the other hand, if something is actually ''known'', then it categorically cannot be false.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support her and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under her weight, it could be said that she ''believed'' that the bridge was safe but that her belief was mistaken. It would ''not'' be accurate to say that she ''knew'' that the bridge was safe, because it was not. By contrast, if the bridge supported her weight, then the person might say that she had believed the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to herself (by crossing it), she ''knows'' it was safe.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nEpistemologists argue over whether a belief is the proper [[truth-bearer]]. Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true [[propositions]], and others as a system of justified true sentences. Plato, in his [[Gorgias_(dialogue)|Gorgias]], argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm |title=Gorgias |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 October 2008 |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher= |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Justification===\nIn the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Socrates]] considers several theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief \"with an account\" (meaning explained or defined in some way). According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition but also have a good reason for doing so.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.169}}</ref> One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.175}}</ref> For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have ''known'' that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe definition of knowledge as the justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} At this time, a paper written by the American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]] provoked significant widespread discussion. (See [[theory of justification|theories of justification]] for other views on the idea.)\n\n===Gettier problem===\n{{Main|Gettier problem}}\n[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] representing a definition of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}]]\n[[Edmund Gettier]] is best known for his 1963 paper entitled ''Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?'', which called into question the concept of knowledge as justified true belief.<ref name=gettier>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Gettier, Edmund\n|year= 1963\n|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\n|jstor=3326922\n|journal = Analysis\n|volume = 23\n|issue=6\n|pages=121\u2013123\n|doi = 10.2307/3326922\n|url= https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf\n}}</ref> In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which one's belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge. That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the \"knowledge\" category (yellow region).\n\nAccording to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have the knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two [[thought experiment]]s, which have become known as ''Gettier cases'', as [[counterexample]]s to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this, Smith infers, \"The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\" However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not ''know'' that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket, because Smith's belief is \"...true by the number of coins in ''Jones's'' pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.\" (see<ref name = gettier/> p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified but only happens to be true by luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (believing that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth\u2014wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without the actual knowledge to base it on.\n\n====Responses to Gettier====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to define knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition or proposing a completely new set of conditions disregarding the classical ones entirely.\n\n=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility=====\nIn one response to Gettier, the American philosopher [[Richard Kirkham]] has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the [[infallibilism|infallibilist]] one.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? | author=Richard L. Kirkham | journal=Mind | year=1984 | volume=93 | issue=372 | pages=501\u2013513 | doi=10.1093/mind/XCIII.372.501 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529101713/http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | archivedate=29 May 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> To qualify as an item of knowledge, goes the theory, a belief must not only be true and justified, the justification of the belief must ''necessitate'' its truth. In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.\n\nYet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is ''indefeasibility.'' [[Defeasibility]] theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person ''S'' believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to substantiate the claim that Tom Grabit took a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, \"Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.\" When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.\n\nThe Indian philosopher [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B.K. Matilal]] has drawn on the [[Navya-Ny\u0101ya]] [[fallibilism]] tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between ''know p,'' and ''know that one knows p''\u2014these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge ''simpliciter''). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus, a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level when one considers the knowledge-hood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is a lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of ''knowing whether he knows p'', doubts may arise. \"If, in\nsome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledge-hood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence). I am mistaken about the truth of my belief\u2014and this is by Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be sustained.\"<ref name=Matilal>\n{{cite book\n| author =      Bimal Krishna Matilal\n| title =       Perception: An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge\n| publisher =   Oxford India 2002\n| year =        1986\n| ISBN =      978-0-19-824625-1\n| author-link = Bimal Krishna Matilal\n}} The Gettier problem is dealt with in Chapter 4, ''Knowledge as a mental episode''. The thread continues in the next chapter, ''Knowing that one knows''. It is also discussed in Matilal's ''Word and the World'' p. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\n=====Reliabilism=====\n{{Main|Reliabilism}}\nReliabilism has been a significant line of response to the Gettier problem among philosophers, originating with work by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the 1960s. According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if a reliable belief-forming process produces it. Examples of reliable processes include standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | editor1-first=G.S.| editor1-last=Pappas |title=Justification and Knowledge | publisher=Reidel | location=Dordrecht, Holland | date=1979 | page=11 |chapter=Reliabilism: What Is Justified Belief? | isbn=978-90-277-1024-6}}</ref>\n\nGettier cases have challenged reliabilism. {{anchor|Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades}}Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees several buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns.

His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocence, based on faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.\n\nThe British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs which, while they \"track the truth\" (as Nozick's account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons. He says that \"we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.\"<ref name=\"Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Blackburn|first=Simon|title=Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/thinkcompellingi00bla_kzi|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976984-1}}</ref> In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozick's, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.\n\n[[Timothy Williamson]] has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some other condition(s), but primary. In his book ''[[Knowledge and its Limits]],'' Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be broken down into a set of other ideas through analysis. Instead, it is ''[[sui generis]].'' Thus, according to Williamson, justification, truth, and belief are [[Necessary and sufficient|necessary but not sufficient]] for knowledge.\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]] writes in his \"[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|Causal Theory of Knowing]]\" that knowledge requires a [[Causal chain|causal link]] between the truth of a proposition and the belief in that proposition.\n\n===Externalism and internalism===\n{{Main|Internalism, and externalism}}\nA central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other.\n\nExternalists hold that factors deemed \"external,\" meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of justification. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that for a justified true belief to count as knowledge; there must be a link or dependency between the belief and the state of the external world. Usually, this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is \"outside\" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, on the other hand, assert that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.\n\nThough unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] as an early example of the internalist path to justification. He wrote that because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as \"indubitably true,\" he advocates, would be to see things \"clearly and distinctly.\" <ref name=Regulae>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. I|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref> He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then it's reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that man's ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know but not with omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.<ref name=\"Meditations on First Philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. II|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\nThe dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (I think; therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes' theory. In his methodological doubt\u2014doubting everything he previously knew so he could start from a blank slate\u2014the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his existence: \"I do not exist\" would be a contradiction in terms. The act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Descartes could doubt his senses, his body, and the world around him\u2014but he could not deny his existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist to manifest that doubt. Even if some \"evil genius\" were deceiving him, he would have to exist to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he called his Archimedean point, to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes' epistemological justification depended on his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.<ref name=Refutations>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\n===Value problem===\nWe generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in [[Plato]]'s Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Plato | title=Five Dialogues | date=2002 | publisher=Hackett Pub.

Zagzebski analogizes the value of knowledge to the value of espresso produced by an espresso maker: \"The liquid in this cup is not improved by the fact that it comes from a reliable espresso maker. If the espresso tastes good, it makes no difference if it comes from an unreliable machine.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zagzebski|first1=Linda|title=The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=34|issue=1/2|page=13|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ZAGTFE.pdf}}</ref> For Zagzebski, the value of knowledge deflates to the value of mere true belief. She assumes that reliability in itself has no value or disvalue, but Goldman and Olsson disagree. They point out that Zagzebski's conclusion rests on the assumption of veritism: all that matters is the acquisition of true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | last2=Olsson| first2=E.J. | editor1-first=A. | editor1-last=Haddock | editor2-first=A. | editor2-last=Millar | editor3-first=D.| editor3-last=Pritchard |title=Epistemic Value | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | page=24 |chapter=Reliabilism and the Value of Knowledge |isbn=978-0-19-923118-8 | lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> To the contrary, they argue that a careful process for acquiring a true belief adds value to the mere true belief by making it more likely that future beliefs of a similar kind will be true. By analogy, having a reliable espresso maker that produced a good cup of espresso would be more valuable than having an unreliable one that luckily produced a good cup because the reliable one would more likely produce good future cups compared to the unreliable one.\n\nThe value problem is important for assessing the adequacy of theories of knowledge that conceive of knowledge as consisting of true belief and other components. According to [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], an adequate account of knowledge should resist counterexamples and allow an explanation of the value of knowledge over mere true belief. Should a theory of knowledge fail to do so, it would prove inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York | isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 | page=5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York| isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 }}</ref> Advocates of virtue epistemology have argued that the value of knowledge comes from an internal relationship between the knower and the mental state of believing.<ref name=\"SEPValue\" />\n\n==Acquiring knowledge==\n===''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge===\n{{Main|A priori and a posteriori}}\nVarious philosophers have disputed the nature of this distinction; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows:\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything independent from experience.\n* ''[[Empirical evidence|A posteriori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).\nA priori knowledge is a way of gaining knowledge without the need for experience.  In Bruce Russell's article \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\"<ref>Russell, Bruce, \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge,\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/apriori/>.</ref> he says that it is \"knowledge based on a priori justification,\" (1) which relies on intuition and the nature of these intuitions.  A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience.  A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more.  Option A: All crows are birds.  Option B: All crows are black.  If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird.  If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows, therefore, knowing they are black.  He goes on to say that it doesn't matter if the statement is true or not, only that if you believe in one or the other that matters.\n\nThe idea of a priori knowledge is that it is based on intuition or rational insights.  Laurence BonJour says in his article \"The Structure of Empirical Knowledge,\" <ref>BonJour, Laurence, 1985, The Structure of Empirical Knowledge, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> that a \"rational insight is an immediate, non-inferential grasp, apprehension or 'seeing' that some proposition is necessarily true.\" (3) Going back to the crow example, by Laurence BonJour's definition, the reason you would believe in option A is that you have a direct knowledge that a crow is a bird, without ever experiencing one.\n\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. \"Only small parts of the brain resemble a [[tabula rasa]]; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid\".<ref>Wilson, E.O., [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1975</ref>\n\n===Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction===\n{{Main|Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction}}\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', drew a distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" propositions. He contended that some propositions are such that we can know they are true just by understanding their meaning. For example, consider, \"My father's brother is my uncle.\" We can know it is true solely by our understanding of what its terms mean. Philosophers call such propositions ''analytic\"''. Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, have distinct subjects and predicates. An example would be, \"My father's brother has black hair.\" Kant stated that all mathematical and scientific statements are analytic priori propositions because they are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.\n\nThe American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in his ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]'', famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction.<ref>Russell, G.: Truth in Virtue of Meaning: A Defence of the Analytic/Synthetic Distinction. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2008</ref>\n\n=== Science as knowledge acquisition ===\n{{Main|Philosophy of Science}}\n\nScience is viewed as a refined, formalized, systematic, or institutionalized form of the pursuit and acquisition of empirical knowledge. As such, the [[philosophy of science]] may be viewed variously as an application or foundation of the philosophy of knowledge acquisition.\n\n==Regress problem==\n{{Main|Regress argument}}\n\nThe regress problem is the problem of providing a complete logical foundation for human knowledge. The traditional way of supporting a rational argument is to appeal to other rational arguments, typically using chains of reason and rules of logic. A classic example that goes back to Aristotle is deducing that ''Socrates is mortal.'' We have a logical rule that says, ''All humans are mortal'' and an assertion that ''Socrates is human'' and we deduce that ''Socrates is mortal''. In this example, how do we know that Socrates is human? Presumably, we apply other rules such as:  ''All born from human females are human.'' Which then leaves open the question of how do we know that all born from humans are human? This is the regress problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified? As John Pollock stated:\n\n<blockquote>... to justify a belief, one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them based on any other belief, or else for each justified belief, there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification [the nebula theory]. In this theory, there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere.<ref name=Pollock>\n{{cite book\n| author =      John L. Pollock\n| title =      Knowledge, and Justification\n| publisher =      Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey\n| year =      1975\n| ISBN =      978-0-691-07203-6\n| url =      https://archive.org/details/knowledgejustifi0000poll\n}} p. 26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe apparent impossibility of completing an infinite chain of reasoning is thought by some to support [[skepticism]]. It is also the impetus for Descartes' famous dictum: ''[[I think; therefore I am]]''. Descartes was looking for some logical statements that could be true without appeal to other explanations.\n\n===Response to the regress problem===\n\nMany epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.\n* Foundationalism\n[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] respond to the regress problem by asserting that certain \"foundations\" or \"basic beliefs\" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from different views. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered possible examples of fundamental beliefs.\n\nThe chief criticism of foundationalism is that if other beliefs do not support a belief, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational |title=Foundational Theories of Epistemic Justification}}</ref>\n* Coherentism\nAnother response to the regress problem is [[coherentism]], which is the rejection of the assumption that the regress proceeds according to a pattern of linear justification. To avoid the charge of circularity, [[coherentism|coherentists]] hold that an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system of which it is a part. This theory has the advantage of avoiding the infinite regress without claiming special, possibly arbitrary status for some particular class of beliefs. Yet, since a system can be coherent while also being wrong, coherentists face the difficulty of ensuring that the whole system [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any circular argument is, at best, only trivially valid. That is, to be illuminating, arguments must operate with information from multiple premises, not simply conclude by reiterating a premise.\n\nWarburton writes in ''Thinking from A to Z'', \"Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative.\" (Warburton 1996)\n* Foundherentism\nA position is known as ''[[foundherentism]]'', advanced by [[Susan Haack]], is meant to unify foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the \"analogy of the crossword puzzle.\" Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as \"shaped\" like a single line, [[Susan Haack]] has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence, and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology |first=Susan|last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1993 | isbn=978-0-631-19679-2}}</ref>\n* Infinitism\nAn alternative resolution to the regress problem is known as \"[[infinitism]].\" Infinitists take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to them, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism, and coherentism.\n\n==Branches or schools of thought==\n\n===Historical===\n\nThe historical study of philosophical epistemology is the historical study of efforts to gain philosophical understanding or knowledge of the nature and scope of human knowledge.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\">{{cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Barry|title=The History of Epistemology|journal=Erkenntnis|year=2011|volume=75|issue=3|pages=495\u2013503|doi=10.1007/s10670-011-9337-4}}</ref> Since efforts to get that kind of understanding have a history, the questions philosophical epistemology asks today about human knowledge are not necessarily the same as they once were.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/> But that does not mean that philosophical epistemology is itself a historical subject, or that it pursues only or even primarily historical understanding.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/>\n\n===Empiricism===\n{{Main|Empiricism}}\n\nIn philosophy, [[empiricism]] is generally a theory of knowledge focusing on the role of experience, especially experience based on [[perception|perceptual observations]] by the [[sense]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-54613-3|pages=129\u2013138|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}</ref> Certain forms exempt disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] from these requirements.<ref name=\"Uebel2015\">{{cite book|last=Uebel|first=Thomas|title=Empiricism at the Crossroads: The Vienna Circle's Protocol-Sentence Debate Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq-6CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2015|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9929-6|page=14}}</ref>\n\nThere are many variants of empiricism: [[positivism]], [[philosophical realism|realism]], and [[common sense]] being among the most commonly expounded.

Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.'<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html | title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}</ref> This suggests that we are to analyze ideas and objects in the world for their practical value.

Pramana can be translated as an \"instrument of knowledge\" and refers to various means or sources of knowledge that Indian philosophers held to be reliable. Each school of Indian philosophy had their theories about which pramanas were valid means to knowledge and which were unreliable (and why).<ref>James Lochtefeld, \"Pramana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N\u2013Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp. 520\u2013521</ref> A [[Vedas|Vedic]] text, [[Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka]] (c. 9th\u20136th centuries BCE), lists \"four means of attaining correct knowledge\": ''sm\u1e5bti'' (\"tradition\" or \"scripture\"), ''pratyak\u1e63a'' (\"perception\"), ''aitihya'' (\"communication by one who is expert\", or \"tradition), and ''anum\u0101na'' (\"reasoning\" or \"inference\").<ref>A.B.

Skepticism does not refer to anyone specific school of philosophy, and rather it is a thread that runs through many philosophical discussions of epistemology. [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|Ancient Greek skepticism]] begins with [[Pyrrho]] and the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]] of [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Academic Skepticism]]. In Indian philosophy, [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] was a famous skeptic, and the Buddhist [[Madhyamika]] school has been seen as taking up a form of skepticism. [[Descartes]]' most famous inquiry into mind and body also began as an exercise in skepticism. Descartes began by questioning the validity of all knowledge and looking for some fact that was irrefutable. In so doing, he came to his famous dictum: [[I think; therefore, I am]].\n\n[[Foundationalism]] and the other responses to the regress problem are essentially defenses against skepticism. Similarly, the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] can be viewed as a [[coherentist]] defense against skepticism. James discarded conventional philosophical views of truth and defined truth as based on how well a concept works in a specific context, rather than objective, rational criteria. The philosophy of [[Logical Positivism]] and the work of philosophers such as [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] can be viewed as skepticism applied to what can truly be considered scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Popkin|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volume 7|date=1972|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-864651-0|pages=449\u2013461|chapter=Skepticism}}</ref>\n\n==The problem of skepticism==\n[[Skepticism]] questions whether knowledge is possible at all. Skeptics argue that [[belief]] in something does not justify whether or not it is necessarily true.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\">{{cite journal|title=Skepticism|journal=Encyclopedia of Empiricism|year=1997}}</ref> Characterizing knowledge as strong or weak is dependent on a person's viewpoint and their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/> Much of our knowledge of epistemology is derived from, in particular, rational and philosophical skepticism.<ref>{{Citation|last=Klein|first=Peter|title=Skepticism|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/skepticism/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nAmong other arguments, skeptics use [[Agrippa's trilemma]] (named after the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Agrippa the Skeptic]]) to demonstrate that certain belief could not be achieved. [[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] have used the same ''trilemma'' argument as justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs. Skeptics oppose what they sometimes call \"[[dogma]]tic foundationalism,\" which states that there must be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches, including, claiming that \"basic positions\" ''must'' exist, amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nThe [[evil demon]] skepticism described by [[Descartes]] (first described in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]''; with an updated version from sci-fi literature describing it as the [[brain in a vat]]) supposes that our sensory impressions may be under the control of some external power. As such, everything we see is fake, and we can never know anything about the 'real' world.  Even if these foreign powers do not exist, we still must depend on only the information provided by our senses and can, therefore, make no definite statement about anything beyond that information.\n\nThere are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as \"mitigated\" and \"unmitigated\" skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still valid forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept \"strong\" or \"strict\" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These more ineffective claims can be assigned the title of \"virtual knowledge,\" but only to justified beliefs.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>   Characterizing knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>Several modifications of skepticism have arisen over the years, including the following: <ref> [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism Peter Suber, \"Classical Skepticism\"]</ref>\n\n[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to know but adheres to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually \"true.\"\n\nPhilosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions but does so without asserting certainty.\n\nSome forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{outline}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Andragogy]]\n* [[Epistemological rupture]]\n* [[Epistemic democracy]]\n* [[Feminist epistemology]]\n* [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n* [[Gnosiology]]\n* [[Knowledge]]\n* [[Metascience]]\n* [[Methodology]]\n* [[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n* [[Monopolies of knowledge]]\n* [[Noology|No\u00f6logy]]\n* [[Ontology]]\n* [[Participatory epistemology]]\n* [[Pedagogy]]\n* [[Philosophy of space and time]]\n* [[Reformed epistemology]]\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Self-evidence]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Sociology of knowledge]]\n* [[Uncertainty principle]]\n* [[Virtue epistemology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Works cited\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n<!-- Please order books alphabetically by the author's last name -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Annis | first = David | year = 1978 | title = A Contextualist Theory of Epistemic Justification | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013219 }}\n* [[Alfred Jules Ayer|Ayer, Alfred Jules]]. 1936.

The word first appeared in English in 1847 as a translation of the German in New York's ''Eclectic Magazine'' review of a philosophical novel by German author [[Jean Paul]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |chapter=Epistemology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = anonymous| title=Jean-Paul Frederich Richter |journal=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science and Art |date=Nov 1847 |volume=12 |page=317 | hdl=2027/iau.31858055206621 }}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The title of one of the principal works of Fichte is \u2032Wissenschaftslehre,\u2032 which, after the analogy of ''technology'' ... we render ''epistemology''.}}\n\nIt was properly introduced in the philosophical literature by Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in his ''Institutes of Metaphysics'' (1854):<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferrier |first1=James Frederick |title=Institutes of metaphysic : the theory of knowing and being |date=1854 |publisher=W.

[[John Locke]] describes his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) as an inquiry \"into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223061 |date=1689 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> According to Brett Warren, the character ''Epistemon'' in [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]]'s ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1591) \"was meant to be a personification of a philosophical concept currently known as 'epistemology': the investigation into the differences of a justified belief versus its opinion.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=King James|first2=Brett|last2=Warren|title=The Annotated Daemonologie.

Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between [[Propositional knowledge|\"knowing that\"]] (know a concept), [[Know-how|\"knowing how\"]] (understand an operation), and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|\"acquaintance-knowledge\"]] (know by relation), with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these.<ref>John Bengson (Editor), Marc A. Moffett (Editor): Essays on Knowledge, Mind, and Action. New York: Oxford University Press. 2011</ref>\n\nWhile these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are defined explicitly in other languages (N.B. some languages related to English have been said to retain these verbs, e.g. [[Scots language|Scots]]: {{lang|sco|wit}} and {{lang|sco|[[wikt:ken#Scots|ken]]}}). In French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch 'to know (a person)' is translated using {{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, {{lang|pt|conhecer}}, {{lang|es|conocer}} and {{lang|de|kennen}} (both German and Dutch) respectively, whereas 'to know (how to do something)' is translated using {{lang|fr|savoir}}, {{lang|es|saber}} (both Portuguese and Spanish), {{lang|de|wissen}}, and {{lang|nl|weten}}. Modern Greek has the verbs {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|gnor\u00edzo}}) and {{lang|el|\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ks\u00e9ro}}).

This verb seems the most appropriate in terms of describing the \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence the German name \"{{lang|de|[[:de:Erkenntnistheorie|Erkenntnistheorie]]}}\". The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.\n\nIn his paper ''On Denoting'' and his later book ''Problems of Philosophy'' [[Bertrand Russell]] stressed the distinction between \"[[knowledge by description]]\" and \"[[knowledge by acquaintance]].\" [[Gilbert Ryle]] is also credited with stressing the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in ''[[The Concept of Mind]].'' In ''Personal Knowledge,'' [[Michael Polanyi]] argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a [[bicycle]], he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the [[physics]] involved in maintaining a state of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Balance|balance]] cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to [[infinite regress]].\n\nIn recent times, epistemologists including [[Ernest Sosa|Sosa]], [[John Greco (philosopher)|Greco]], [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kvanvig |first1=Jonathan L. |title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139442282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILTIEjvbeLoC |language=en}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski]] and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate people's \"properties\" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Belief===\n{{Main|Belief}}\nIn common speech, a \"statement of belief\" is typically an expression of faith or trust in a person, power, or other entity. While it includes such traditional views, epistemology is also concerned with what we believe. This includes 'the truth' and everything else we accept as 'true' for ourselves from a cognitive point of view.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Truth===\n{{Main|Truth}}\n{{See also|Criteria of truth}}\nWhether someone's belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the other hand, if something is actually ''known'', then it categorically cannot be false.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support her and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under her weight, it could be said that she ''believed'' that the bridge was safe but that her belief was mistaken. It would ''not'' be accurate to say that she ''knew'' that the bridge was safe, because it was not. By contrast, if the bridge supported her weight, then the person might say that she had believed the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to herself (by crossing it), she ''knows'' it was safe.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nEpistemologists argue over whether a belief is the proper [[truth-bearer]]. Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true [[propositions]], and others as a system of justified true sentences. Plato, in his [[Gorgias_(dialogue)|Gorgias]], argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm |title=Gorgias |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 October 2008 |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher= |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Justification===\nIn the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Socrates]] considers several theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief \"with an account\" (meaning explained or defined in some way). According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition but also have a good reason for doing so.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.169}}</ref> One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.175}}</ref> For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have ''known'' that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe definition of knowledge as the justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} At this time, a paper written by the American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]] provoked significant widespread discussion. (See [[theory of justification|theories of justification]] for other views on the idea.)\n\n===Gettier problem===\n{{Main|Gettier problem}}\n[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] representing a definition of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}]]\n[[Edmund Gettier]] is best known for his 1963 paper entitled ''Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?'', which called into question the concept of knowledge as justified true belief.<ref name=gettier>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Gettier, Edmund\n|year= 1963\n|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\n|jstor=3326922\n|journal = Analysis\n|volume = 23\n|issue=6\n|pages=121\u2013123\n|doi = 10.2307/3326922\n|url= https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf\n}}</ref> In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which one's belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge. That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the \"knowledge\" category (yellow region).\n\nAccording to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have the knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two [[thought experiment]]s, which have become known as ''Gettier cases'', as [[counterexample]]s to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this, Smith infers, \"The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\" However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not ''know'' that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket, because Smith's belief is \"...true by the number of coins in ''Jones's'' pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.\" (see<ref name = gettier/> p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified but only happens to be true by luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (believing that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth\u2014wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without the actual knowledge to base it on.\n\n====Responses to Gettier====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to define knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition or proposing a completely new set of conditions disregarding the classical ones entirely.\n\n=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility=====\nIn one response to Gettier, the American philosopher [[Richard Kirkham]] has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the [[infallibilism|infallibilist]] one.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? | author=Richard L.

In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.\n\nYet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is ''indefeasibility.'' [[Defeasibility]] theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person ''S'' believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to substantiate the claim that Tom Grabit took a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, \"Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.\" When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.\n\nThe Indian philosopher [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B.K. Matilal]] has drawn on the [[Navya-Ny\u0101ya]] [[fallibilism]] tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between ''know p,'' and ''know that one knows p''\u2014these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge ''simpliciter''). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus, a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level when one considers the knowledge-hood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is a lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of ''knowing whether he knows p'', doubts may arise. \"If, in\nsome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledge-hood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence). I am mistaken about the truth of my belief\u2014and this is by Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be sustained.\"<ref name=Matilal>\n{{cite book\n| author =      Bimal Krishna Matilal\n| title =       Perception: An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge\n| publisher =   Oxford India 2002\n| year =        1986\n| ISBN =      978-0-19-824625-1\n| author-link = Bimal Krishna Matilal\n}} The Gettier problem is dealt with in Chapter 4, ''Knowledge as a mental episode''. The thread continues in the next chapter, ''Knowing that one knows''. It is also discussed in Matilal's ''Word and the World'' p. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\n=====Reliabilism=====\n{{Main|Reliabilism}}\nReliabilism has been a significant line of response to the Gettier problem among philosophers, originating with work by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the 1960s. According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if a reliable belief-forming process produces it. Examples of reliable processes include standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | editor1-first=G.S.| editor1-last=Pappas |title=Justification and Knowledge | publisher=Reidel | location=Dordrecht, Holland | date=1979 | page=11 |chapter=Reliabilism: What Is Justified Belief? | isbn=978-90-277-1024-6}}</ref>\n\nGettier cases have challenged reliabilism. {{anchor|Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades}}Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees several buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other [[barn]]-like buildings he saw were fa\u00e7ades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e., his vision) since he only acquired his true belief by accident.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Appearing as Irreducible in Perception |first=Alan H. |last=Goldman |author-link= Alan H.

His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocence, based on faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.\n\nThe British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs which, while they \"track the truth\" (as Nozick's account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons. He says that \"we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.\"<ref name=\"Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Blackburn|first=Simon|title=Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/thinkcompellingi00bla_kzi|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976984-1}}</ref> In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozick's, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.\n\n[[Timothy Williamson]] has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some other condition(s), but primary. In his book ''[[Knowledge and its Limits]],'' Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be broken down into a set of other ideas through analysis. Instead, it is ''[[sui generis]].'' Thus, according to Williamson, justification, truth, and belief are [[Necessary and sufficient|necessary but not sufficient]] for knowledge.\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]] writes in his \"[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|Causal Theory of Knowing]]\" that knowledge requires a [[Causal chain|causal link]] between the truth of a proposition and the belief in that proposition.\n\n===Externalism and internalism===\n{{Main|Internalism, and externalism}}\nA central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other.\n\nExternalists hold that factors deemed \"external,\" meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of justification. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that for a justified true belief to count as knowledge; there must be a link or dependency between the belief and the state of the external world. Usually, this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is \"outside\" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, on the other hand, assert that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.\n\nThough unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] as an early example of the internalist path to justification. He wrote that because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as \"indubitably true,\" he advocates, would be to see things \"clearly and distinctly.\" <ref name=Regulae>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. I|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref> He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then it's reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that man's ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know but not with omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.<ref name=\"Meditations on First Philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. II|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\nThe dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (I think; therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes' theory. In his methodological doubt\u2014doubting everything he previously knew so he could start from a blank slate\u2014the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his existence: \"I do not exist\" would be a contradiction in terms. The act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Descartes could doubt his senses, his body, and the world around him\u2014but he could not deny his existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist to manifest that doubt. Even if some \"evil genius\" were deceiving him, he would have to exist to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he called his Archimedean point, to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes' epistemological justification depended on his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.<ref name=Refutations>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\n===Value problem===\nWe generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in [[Plato]]'s Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Plato | title=Five Dialogues | date=2002 | publisher=Hackett Pub.

Zagzebski analogizes the value of knowledge to the value of espresso produced by an espresso maker: \"The liquid in this cup is not improved by the fact that it comes from a reliable espresso maker. If the espresso tastes good, it makes no difference if it comes from an unreliable machine.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zagzebski|first1=Linda|title=The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=34|issue=1/2|page=13|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ZAGTFE.pdf}}</ref> For Zagzebski, the value of knowledge deflates to the value of mere true belief. She assumes that reliability in itself has no value or disvalue, but Goldman and Olsson disagree. They point out that Zagzebski's conclusion rests on the assumption of veritism: all that matters is the acquisition of true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | last2=Olsson| first2=E.J. | editor1-first=A. | editor1-last=Haddock | editor2-first=A. | editor2-last=Millar | editor3-first=D.| editor3-last=Pritchard |title=Epistemic Value | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | page=24 |chapter=Reliabilism and the Value of Knowledge |isbn=978-0-19-923118-8 | lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> To the contrary, they argue that a careful process for acquiring a true belief adds value to the mere true belief by making it more likely that future beliefs of a similar kind will be true. By analogy, having a reliable espresso maker that produced a good cup of espresso would be more valuable than having an unreliable one that luckily produced a good cup because the reliable one would more likely produce good future cups compared to the unreliable one.\n\nThe value problem is important for assessing the adequacy of theories of knowledge that conceive of knowledge as consisting of true belief and other components. According to [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], an adequate account of knowledge should resist counterexamples and allow an explanation of the value of knowledge over mere true belief. Should a theory of knowledge fail to do so, it would prove inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York | isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 | page=5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York| isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 }}</ref> Advocates of virtue epistemology have argued that the value of knowledge comes from an internal relationship between the knower and the mental state of believing.<ref name=\"SEPValue\" />\n\n==Acquiring knowledge==\n===''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge===\n{{Main|A priori and a posteriori}}\nVarious philosophers have disputed the nature of this distinction; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows:\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything independent from experience.\n* ''[[Empirical evidence|A posteriori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).\nA priori knowledge is a way of gaining knowledge without the need for experience.  In Bruce Russell's article \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\"<ref>Russell, Bruce, \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge,\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/apriori/>.</ref> he says that it is \"knowledge based on a priori justification,\" (1) which relies on intuition and the nature of these intuitions.  A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience.  A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more.  Option A: All crows are birds.  Option B: All crows are black.  If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird.  If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows, therefore, knowing they are black.  He goes on to say that it doesn't matter if the statement is true or not, only that if you believe in one or the other that matters.\n\nThe idea of a priori knowledge is that it is based on intuition or rational insights.  Laurence BonJour says in his article \"The Structure of Empirical Knowledge,\" <ref>BonJour, Laurence, 1985, The Structure of Empirical Knowledge, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> that a \"rational insight is an immediate, non-inferential grasp, apprehension or 'seeing' that some proposition is necessarily true.\" (3) Going back to the crow example, by Laurence BonJour's definition, the reason you would believe in option A is that you have a direct knowledge that a crow is a bird, without ever experiencing one.\n\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. \"Only small parts of the brain resemble a [[tabula rasa]]; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid\".<ref>Wilson, E.O., [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1975</ref>\n\n===Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction===\n{{Main|Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction}}\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', drew a distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" propositions. He contended that some propositions are such that we can know they are true just by understanding their meaning. For example, consider, \"My father's brother is my uncle.\" We can know it is true solely by our understanding of what its terms mean. Philosophers call such propositions ''analytic\"''. Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, have distinct subjects and predicates. An example would be, \"My father's brother has black hair.\" Kant stated that all mathematical and scientific statements are analytic priori propositions because they are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.\n\nThe American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in his ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]'', famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction.<ref>Russell, G.: Truth in Virtue of Meaning: A Defence of the Analytic/Synthetic Distinction. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2008</ref>\n\n=== Science as knowledge acquisition ===\n{{Main|Philosophy of Science}}\n\nScience is viewed as a refined, formalized, systematic, or institutionalized form of the pursuit and acquisition of empirical knowledge. As such, the [[philosophy of science]] may be viewed variously as an application or foundation of the philosophy of knowledge acquisition.\n\n==Regress problem==\n{{Main|Regress argument}}\n\nThe regress problem is the problem of providing a complete logical foundation for human knowledge. The traditional way of supporting a rational argument is to appeal to other rational arguments, typically using chains of reason and rules of logic. A classic example that goes back to Aristotle is deducing that ''Socrates is mortal.'' We have a logical rule that says, ''All humans are mortal'' and an assertion that ''Socrates is human'' and we deduce that ''Socrates is mortal''. In this example, how do we know that Socrates is human? Presumably, we apply other rules such as:  ''All born from human females are human.'' Which then leaves open the question of how do we know that all born from humans are human? This is the regress problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified? As John Pollock stated:\n\n<blockquote>... to justify a belief, one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them based on any other belief, or else for each justified belief, there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification [the nebula theory]. In this theory, there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere.<ref name=Pollock>\n{{cite book\n| author =      John L. Pollock\n| title =      Knowledge, and Justification\n| publisher =      Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey\n| year =      1975\n| ISBN =      978-0-691-07203-6\n| Url =      https://archive.org/details/knowledgejustifi0000poll\n}} p. 26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe apparent impossibility of completing an infinite chain of reasoning is thought by some to support [[skepticism]]. It is also the impetus for Descartes' famous dictum: ''[[I think; therefore I am]]''. Descartes was looking for some logical statements that could be true without appeal to other explanations.\n\n===Response to the regress problem===\n\nMany epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.\n* Foundationalism\n[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] respond to the regress problem by asserting that certain \"foundations\" or \"basic beliefs\" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from different views. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered possible examples of fundamental beliefs.\n\nThe chief criticism of foundationalism is that if other beliefs do not support a belief, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational |title=Foundational Theories of Epistemic Justification}}</ref>\n* Coherentism\nAnother response to the regress problem is [[coherentism]], which is the rejection of the assumption that the regress proceeds according to a pattern of linear justification. To avoid the charge of circularity, [[coherentism|coherentists]] hold that an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system of which it is a part. This theory has the advantage of avoiding the infinite regress without claiming special, possibly arbitrary status for some particular class of beliefs. Yet, since a system can be coherent while also being wrong, coherentists face the difficulty of ensuring that the whole system [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any circular argument is, at best, only trivially valid. That is, to be illuminating, arguments must operate with information from multiple premises, not simply conclude by reiterating a premise.\n\nWarburton writes in ''Thinking from A to Z'', \"Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative.\" (Warburton 1996)\n* Foundherentism\nA position is known as ''[[foundherentism]]'', advanced by [[Susan Haack]], is meant to unify foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the \"analogy of the crossword puzzle.\" Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as \"shaped\" like a single line, [[Susan Haack]] has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence, and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology |first=Susan|last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1993 | isbn=978-0-631-19679-2}}</ref>\n* Infinitism\nAn alternative resolution to the regress problem is known as \"[[infinitism]].\" Infinitists take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to them, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism, and coherentism.\n\n==Branches or schools of thought==\n\n===Historical===\n\nThe historical study of philosophical epistemology is the historical study of efforts to gain philosophical understanding or knowledge of the nature and scope of human knowledge.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\">{{cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Barry|title=The History of Epistemology|journal=Erkenntnis|year=2011|volume=75|issue=3|pages=495\u2013503|doi=10.1007/s10670-011-9337-4}}</ref> Since efforts to get that kind of understanding have a history, the questions philosophical epistemology asks today about human knowledge are not necessarily the same as they once were.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/> But that does not mean that philosophical epistemology is itself a historical subject, or that it pursues only or even primarily historical understanding.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/>\n\n===Empiricism===\n{{Main|Empiricism}}\n\nIn philosophy, [[empiricism]] is generally a theory of knowledge focusing on the role of experience, especially experience based on [[perception|perceptual observations]] by the [[sense]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-54613-3|pages=129\u2013138|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}</ref> Certain forms exempt disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] from these requirements.<ref name=\"Uebel2015\">{{cite book|last=Uebel|first=Thomas|title=Empiricism at the Crossroads: The Vienna Circle's Protocol-Sentence Debate Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq-6CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2015|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9929-6|page=14}}</ref>\n\nThere are many variants of empiricism: [[positivism]], [[philosophical realism|realism]], and [[common sense]] being among the most commonly expounded.

Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.'<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html | title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}</ref> This suggests that we are to analyze ideas and objects in the world for their practical value.

Skepticism does not refer to anyone specific school of philosophy, and rather it is a thread that runs through many philosophical discussions of epistemology. [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|Ancient Greek skepticism]] begins with [[Pyrrho]] and the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]] of [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Academic Skepticism]]. In Indian philosophy, [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] was a famous skeptic, and the Buddhist [[Madhyamika]] school has been seen as taking up a form of skepticism. [[Descartes]]' most famous inquiry into mind and body also began as an exercise in skepticism. Descartes began by questioning the validity of all knowledge and looking for some fact that was irrefutable. In so doing, he came to his famous dictum: [[I think; therefore, I am]].\n\n[[Foundationalism]] and the other responses to the regress problem are essentially defenses against skepticism. Similarly, the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] can be viewed as a [[coherentist]] defense against skepticism. James discarded conventional philosophical views of truth and defined truth as based on how well a concept works in a specific context, rather than objective, rational criteria. The philosophy of [[Logical Positivism]] and the work of philosophers such as [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] can be viewed as skepticism applied to what can truly be considered scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Popkin|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volume 7|date=1972|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-864651-0|pages=449\u2013461|chapter=Skepticism}}</ref>\n\n==The problem of skepticism==\n[[Skepticism]] questions whether knowledge is possible at all.

[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] have used the same ''trilemma'' argument as justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs. Skeptics oppose what they sometimes call \"[[dogma]]tic foundationalism,\" which states that there must be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches, including, claiming that \"basic positions\" ''must'' exist, amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nThe [[evil demon]] skepticism described by [[Descartes]] (first described in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]''; with an updated version from sci-fi literature describing it as the [[brain in a vat]]) supposes that our sensory impressions may be under the control of some external power. As such, everything we see is fake, and we can never know anything about the 'real' world.  Even if these foreign powers do not exist, we still must depend on only the information provided by our senses and can, therefore, make no definite statement about anything beyond that information.\n\nThere are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as \"mitigated\" and \"unmitigated\" skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still valid forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept \"strong\" or \"strict\" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These more ineffective claims can be assigned the title of \"virtual knowledge,\" but only to justified beliefs.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>   Characterizing knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>Several modifications of skepticism have arisen over the years, including the following: <ref> [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism Peter Suber, \"Classical Skepticism\"]</ref>\n\n[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to know but adheres to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually \"true.\"\n\nPhilosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions but does so without asserting certainty.\n\nSome forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{outline}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Andragogy]]\n* [[Epistemological rupture]]\n* [[Epistemic democracy]]\n* [[Feminist epistemology]]\n* [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n* [[Gnosiology]]\n* [[Knowledge]]\n* [[Metascience]]\n* [[Methodology]]\n* [[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n* [[Monopolies of knowledge]]\n* [[Noology|No\u00f6logy]]\n* [[Ontology]]\n* [[Participatory epistemology]]\n* [[Pedagogy]]\n* [[Philosophy of space and time]]\n* [[Reformed epistemology]]\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Self-evidence]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Sociology of knowledge]]\n* [[Uncertainty principle]]\n* [[Virtue epistemology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Works cited\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n<!-- Please order books alphabetically by the author's last name -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Annis | first = David | year = 1978 | title = A Contextualist Theory of Epistemic Justification | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013219 }}\n* [[Alfred Jules Ayer|Ayer, Alfred Jules]]. 1936.
