Amaterasu birthed three female deities from Susanoo's sword while he birthed five male deities from her necklace. Claiming the gods were hers because they were born of her necklace, and the goddesses were his, she decided that she had won the challenge, as his item produced women. After Susanoo's defeat he went on a rampage destroying much of the heavenly and earthly realm, including Amaterasu's rice fields; he also hurled a [[flayed]] pony at her loom, and killed one of her beloved attendants in a fit of rage. Amaterasu, who was in fury and grief, hid inside the [[Ama-no-Iwato]] (\"heavenly rock cave\"),  plunging the earth into darkness and chaos. Eventually, she was persuaded to leave the cave.

Formerly a practicing [[Homeopathy|homeopath]], she became known throughout Germany as a [[whistleblower]] for her 2015 debut book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'' in which she criticized homeopathy. In 2016 she joined the Science Council of the [[Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften|Society for the Scientific Investigation of Parasciences (GWUP - the German Sceptics Association)]]. and in January 2017 she became Communications Manager for the GWUP.<ref name=\"Wissenschaftsrat\"/> She also serves on the advisory board of the [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Giordano Bruno Foundation]] since May 2017,<ref name=\"BeiratGiordanoBruno\"/> and as vice president of the Humanist Press Foundation in Germany since October 2017.<ref name=\"Tr\u00e4gervereinHPD\"/> In October 2017 her second book, ''Gesundheit \u2014 A Book Not Without Side Effects'', was published.\n\n==Biography==\nGrams grew up in [[Bavaria]], where she graduated high school in 1997. She studied medicine at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], [[Technical University of Munich]], and [[Heidelberg University]], where in 2005 she gained licensure as a physician in Germany.<ref name=\"Zeit_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/><ref name=\"BrandEins_Ketzerin\"/> In 2007 she received her doctorate as a medical faculty member at the [[University of Zurich]]. Until 2009 she was an intern at a private religiously-affiliated hospital in [[Heidelberg]], where she specialized in [[Geriatrics|geriatric]]  and [[Palliative care|palliative]] medicine.<ref name=\"Lebenslauf\"/>\n\nIn 2004, in parallel with her medical education, Grams began pursuing education in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[homeopathy]]. She completed her homeopathic education with an additional professional designation in that area,<ref name=\"GWUP_WhoIsWho\"/> and was active exclusively in private homeopathic practice from 2009 through 2015.<ref name=\"Lebenslauf\"/>\n\nIn May 2015 her first book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'' was published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]] in German (German title ''Hom\u00f6opathie neu gedacht \u2013 Was Patienten wirklich hilft''). She abandoned her homeopathic activity the same year.<ref name=\"RNZ_\u00c4rztinDenkt\"/> Grams is currently active as a [[Scientific communication|science communicator]].<ref name=\"GWUP_Nachrichten12012017\"/>\n\n==Criticism of homeopathy and alternative medicine==\nGrams is an authority, and a leading participant in public debate on the subject of homeopathy.<ref name=\"DasErste_Geldverschwendung\"/><ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/> As a practicing homeopathic doctor she was interviewed by journalists Christian Weymayr and Nicole Hei\u00dfmann for their book ''The Homeopathy Lie'' (German title: ''Die Hom\u00f6opathie-L\u00fcge'').<ref name=\"HNG_MeineStory\"/> Upon reading that book's criticism of homeopathy, Grams wanted to write a rebuttal in defense of homeopathy.<ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/>\n\nInstead, her research in preparation for this rebuttal caused her to reconsider the scientific evidence <ref name=\"NHRMC_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"DAZ_ImmerNoch\"/> on the subject of homeopathy. This in turn led Grams to revise her own views on the topic. Rather than the planned defense of homeopathy, her first book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'', published in May 2015, turned out to be a critical examination of the discipline. The book is especially critical of claims that homeopathy constitutes a specific [[Pharmacotherapy|drug therapy]].<ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/> Grams says she tried to be empathetic in her writing style, intending for the reader to \"feel [her] agony, discovering these facts about homeopathy.\"<ref name=\"TheESP_042\"/> As a practicing homeopath, Grams had experienced individual successes in treating patients, but her search for scientific arguments to justify these successes led her to realize that little evidence existed.<ref name=\"QQ_Merkur_\u00dcbrig\"/> She described the beginning of her doubts about homeopathy as coming \"\u2026when [she] learned that, in evaluating the efficacy of a therapy, the decisive thing is not one's experience but rather the results of clinical studies.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Spektrum_Doubt_Trial\"/> She has said that letting go of her perception of homeopathy as \"some sort of 'parallel knowledge' \u2026 just as admissible and legitimate as scientific knowledge\" required a realization that she had deeply deceived herself.<ref name=\"QQ_Motherboard_Irrsinn\"/><ref name=\"QQ_HPD_Parallelwissen\"/>\n\nAt the end of this learning process, Grams decided to abandon her own private homeopathic practice, and livelihood, because she no longer wanted to offer therapies that she could not fully stand behind.<ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/> In explaining this decision, she draws a contrast between the lack of scientific support<ref name=\"NHRMC_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"RAS_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"NetzHom\u00f6_Pseudo\"/> for homeopathy and the positive secondary effects of the homeopathic setting, including the approachable and attentive [[Alternative medicine#A failure of mainstream medicine|style of patient care]] sometimes termed ''talking medicine''.<ref name=\"INH_Rechte\"/> Grams describes [[Samuel Hahnemann]], the German originator of homeopathy, as a clever person who rebelled against a superstitious, prescientific medical establishment which promoted therapies that imperiled the lives of patients; as she put it, \"[h]omeopathy was, at the time, the lesser evil.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Stern_Hahnemann\"/> She says that Hahnemann's own theories amounted to self-deception, with efficacy no greater than a placebo, \"[w]hich is not surprising, since [homeopathic] medicines contain nothing.\"<ref name=\"QQ_AA_Hahnemann\"/><ref name=\"QQ_BK_Placebo\"/> Grams credits a book by [[Daniel Kahneman]] with helping her understand that homeopathy had appealed to her fast, intuitive thought processes, bypassing her slow, analytical faculties, and that she had \"avoided [[cognitive dissonance]] by rationally questioning homeopathy at a very late stage.\"<ref name=\"QQ_HPD_Kahneman\"/>\n\nAlthough Grams fundamentally opposes homeopathy as a discipline, she wishes to see mainstream health systems embrace the idea of ''better medicine'' \u2014 an effort to enable intensive attention to the patient in daily medical practice.<ref name=\"Brightsblog_Schlagwort\"/> In interviews with German daily newspapers ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Die Welt]]'', Grams stated that \"[h]omeopathy works because we homeopaths and our patients have the idea that it works\",<ref name=\"QQ_Sueddeutsche_Wirkt\"/> and characterized homeopathy itself as a patient which \"lacks data and facts, it hallucinates, it does not want to admit its illness. But insight into illness can be a first step to recovery.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Welt_SelbstPatient\"/> She perceives a distorted picture among homeopaths of scientific work, in which science is thought to be not a method but a worldview; this misunderstanding leads to a lack of clarity about the ardour and rigor science requires in order to produce a result. She nonetheless considers the practical element of homeopathy \u2014 attentiveness to the patient \u2014 valuable, opining that physicians \"must carry this over into everyday medical and clinical life \u2014 but without the magic part involving succussion and potentization.\"<ref name=\"LaborJournal_Methode\"/> In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Grams said that given the lack of evidence for homeopathic medicines' efficacy exceeding the [[placebo effect]], \"[i]f a group of doctors staunchly asserts that homeopathy works, one must \u2014 for the sake of patients \u2014 object.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Spiegel_FaktIst\"/>\n\nThe impact of Grams' position in print media,<ref name=\"Welt_AlsW\u00e4reIch\"/><ref name=\"Spiegel_AusMeiner\"/><ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/><ref name=\"Zeit_DieNestbeschmutzerin\"/><ref name=\"BrandEins_DieKetzerin\"/><ref name=\"Stern_Warum\"/><ref name=\"LaborJournal_Methode\"/> radio, and television<ref name=\"GWUP_100Fragen\"/><ref name=\"FB_Eine\u00c4rztin\"/><ref name=\"WDR_\u00c4rztin\"/><ref name=\"ZDF_Jahrelang\"/> was an essential factor in the intensified German public discourse surrounding homeopathy since 2015.<ref name=\"DRadio_EineFrage\"/><ref name=\"SWR_Geldverswhwendung\"/><ref name=\"TAZ_Gesch\u00e4ft\"/><ref name=\"Motherboard_Warum\"/> She delivered a talk at SkepKon 2017 titled ''Enlightenment about pseudomedicine: What have skeptics achieved?''<ref name=\"SkepKon_2017\"/>\n\nAlong with author and homeopathy critic Norbert Aust, Grams co-founded the Information Network on Homeopathy (''Informationsnetzwerk Hom\u00f6opathie'' \u2014 INH) in 2016.<ref name=\"FAZ_Globull\"/><ref name=\"DAZ_INH\"/><ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/><ref name=\"INH_Home\"/>\n\nShe lent her expertise as a member of the \"M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis\", a free association of scientists on the subject of \"Pseudomedicine in Public Health\",.as an author in support of the ''M\u00fcnster Memorandum on Practitioners of Alternative Medicine'', which aims to mitigate the potential for patient harm from therapists who lack academic medical education (''Heilpraktiker'' \u2014  literally ''healing practitioners'') by proposing a German regulatory framework to balance the concerns of patient autonomy and freedom of therapy against fairness to health insurance providers and insurees.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnsterMemo\"/><ref name=\"PN_M\u00fcnsterMemo\"/> She also co-authored the second publication of the M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis, the \"''M\u00fcnster Memorandum on Homeopathy''\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.muensteraner-kreis.de/homoeopathie.html|title=Memorandum Hom\u00f6opathie|last=M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis (M\u00fcnster Circle)|date=1 February 2018|website=www.muensteraner-kreis.de|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref> which appeared in 2018.\n\n==Reaction==\nGrams took up the publication of her 2015 book with the intention of stimulating self-reflection among those in the homeopathic orbit. She has expressed regret that this introspection had not yet happened until today.  Homeopaths who reviewed her first book didn't go to a factual discourse but have questioned the motivation behind her conversion (i.e., her change of mind based on rational arguments), mostly in a defamatory way.<ref name=\"Hom\u00f6Online_Falsch\"/><ref name=\"VKHD_Stellungnahme\"/> Grams reported that she had received a lot of rejection since becoming a public critic of homeopathy, often in the form of personal attacks, defamations, even death threats. She had even had to take advantage of police protection at events.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Merkelbach |first1=Annika |title=Natalie Grams:  Professional Homeopath to Professional Skeptic |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/natalie_grams_professional_homeopath_to_professional_skeptic |website=CSCIP |publisher=CFI |accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nTemporarily she held in mind writing a book collecting and discussing the many angry e-mails and comments she has received in response to her writing and activism. She hopes to reach people who share the false popular perception of homeopathic therapy as \"gentle\", \"empathetic\" and basically the \"better medicine\" and prompt them to re-examine that opinion on a factual basis.<ref name=\"TheESP_100\" />\n\n==Writings==\n\n* ''Hom\u00f6opathie neu gedacht \u2013 Was Patienten wirklich hilft'' (''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'').

Formerly a practicing [[Homeopathy|homeopath]], she became known throughout Germany as a [[whistleblower]] for her 2015 debut book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'' in which she criticized homeopathy. In 2016 she joined the Science Council of the [[Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften|Society for the Scientific Investigation of Parasciences (GWUP - the German Sceptics Association)]]. and in January 2017 she became Communications Manager for the GWUP.<ref name=\"Wissenschaftsrat\"/> She also serves on the advisory board of the [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Giordano Bruno Foundation]] since May 2017,<ref name=\"BeiratGiordanoBruno\"/> and as vice president of the Humanist Press Foundation in Germany since October 2017.<ref name=\"Tr\u00e4gervereinHPD\"/> In October 2017 her second book, ''Gesundheit \u2014 A Book Not Without Side Effects'', was published.\n\n==Biography==\nGrams grew up in [[Bavaria]], where she graduated high school in 1997. She studied medicine at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], [[Technical University of Munich]], and [[Heidelberg University]], where in 2005 she gained licensure as a physician in Germany.<ref name=\"Zeit_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/><ref name=\"BrandEins_Ketzerin\"/> In 2007 she received her doctorate as a medical faculty member at the [[University of Zurich]]. Until 2009 she was an intern at a private religiously-affiliated hospital in [[Heidelberg]], where she specialized in [[Geriatrics|geriatric]]  and [[Palliative care|palliative]] medicine.<ref name=\"Lebenslauf\"/>\n\nIn 2004, in parallel with her medical education, Grams began pursuing education in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[homeopathy]]. She completed her homeopathic education with an additional professional designation in that area,<ref name=\"GWUP_WhoIsWho\"/> and was active exclusively in private homeopathic practice from 2009 through 2015.<ref name=\"Lebenslauf\"/>\n\nIn May 2015 her first book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'' was published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]] in German (German title ''Hom\u00f6opathie neu gedacht \u2013 Was Patienten wirklich hilft''). She abandoned her homeopathic activity the same year.<ref name=\"RNZ_\u00c4rztinDenkt\"/> Grams is currently active as a [[Scientific communication|science communicator]].<ref name=\"GWUP_Nachrichten12012017\"/>\n\n==Criticism of homeopathy and alternative medicine==\nGrams is an authority, and a leading participant in public debate on the subject of homeopathy.<ref name=\"DasErste_Geldverschwendung\"/><ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/> As a practicing homeopathic doctor she was interviewed by journalists Christian Weymayr and Nicole Hei\u00dfmann for their book ''The Homeopathy Lie'' (German title: ''Die Hom\u00f6opathie-L\u00fcge'').<ref name=\"HNG_MeineStory\"/> Upon reading that book's criticism of homeopathy, Grams wanted to write a rebuttal in defense of homeopathy.<ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/>\n\nInstead, her research in preparation for this rebuttal caused her to reconsider the scientific evidence <ref name=\"NHRMC_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"DAZ_ImmerNoch\"/> on the subject of homeopathy. This in turn led Grams to revise her own views on the topic. Rather than the planned defense of homeopathy, her first book ''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'', published in May 2015, turned out to be a critical examination of the discipline. The book is especially critical of claims that homeopathy constitutes a specific [[Pharmacotherapy|drug therapy]].<ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/> Grams says she tried to be empathetic in her writing style, intending for the reader to \"feel [her] agony, discovering these facts about homeopathy.\"<ref name=\"TheESP_042\"/> As a practicing homeopath, Grams had experienced individual successes in treating patients, but her search for scientific arguments to justify these successes led her to realize that little evidence existed.<ref name=\"QQ_Merkur_\u00dcbrig\"/> She described the beginning of her doubts about homeopathy as coming \"\u2026when [she] learned that, in evaluating the efficacy of a therapy, the decisive thing is not one's experience but rather the results of clinical studies.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Spektrum_Doubt_Trial\"/> She has said that letting go of her perception of homeopathy as \"some sort of 'parallel knowledge' \u2026 just as admissible and legitimate as scientific knowledge\" required a realization that she had deeply deceived herself.<ref name=\"QQ_Motherboard_Irrsinn\"/><ref name=\"QQ_HPD_Parallelwissen\"/>\n\nAt the end of this learning process, Grams decided to abandon her own private homeopathic practice, and livelihood, because she no longer wanted to offer therapies that she could not fully stand behind.<ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/> In explaining this decision, she draws a contrast between the lack of scientific support<ref name=\"NHRMC_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"RAS_Homeopathy\"/><ref name=\"NetzHom\u00f6_Pseudo\"/> for homeopathy and the positive secondary effects of the homeopathic setting, including the approachable and attentive [[Alternative medicine#A failure of mainstream medicine|style of patient care]] sometimes termed ''talking medicine''.<ref name=\"INH_Rechte\"/> Grams describes [[Samuel Hahnemann]], the German originator of homeopathy, as a clever person who rebelled against a superstitious, prescientific medical establishment which promoted therapies that imperiled the lives of patients; as she put it, \"[h]omeopathy was, at the time, the lesser evil.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Stern_Hahnemann\"/> She says that Hahnemann's own theories amounted to self-deception, with efficacy no greater than a placebo, \"[w]hich is not surprising, since [homeopathic] medicines contain nothing.\"<ref name=\"QQ_AA_Hahnemann\"/><ref name=\"QQ_BK_Placebo\"/> Grams credits a book by [[Daniel Kahneman]] with helping her understand that homeopathy had appealed to her fast, intuitive thought processes, bypassing her slow, analytical faculties, and that she had \"avoided [[cognitive dissonance]] by rationally questioning homeopathy at a very late stage.\"<ref name=\"QQ_HPD_Kahneman\"/>\n\nAlthough Grams fundamentally opposes homeopathy as a discipline, she wishes to see mainstream health systems embrace the idea of ''better medicine'' \u2014 an effort to enable intensive attention to the patient in daily medical practice.<ref name=\"Brightsblog_Schlagwort\"/> In interviews with German daily newspapers ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Die Welt]]'', Grams stated that \"[h]omeopathy works because we homeopaths and our patients have the idea that it works\",<ref name=\"QQ_Sueddeutsche_Wirkt\"/> and characterized homeopathy itself as a patient which \"lacks data and facts, it hallucinates, it does not want to admit its illness. But insight into illness can be a first step to recovery.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Welt_SelbstPatient\"/> She perceives a distorted picture among homeopaths of scientific work, in which science is thought to be not a method but a worldview; this misunderstanding leads to a lack of clarity about the ardour and rigor science requires in order to produce a result. She nonetheless considers the practical element of homeopathy \u2014 attentiveness to the patient \u2014 valuable, opining that physicians \"must carry this over into everyday medical and clinical life \u2014 but without the magic part involving succussion and potentization.\"<ref name=\"LaborJournal_Methode\"/> In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Grams said that given the lack of evidence for homeopathic medicines' efficacy exceeding the [[placebo effect]], \"[i]f a group of doctors staunchly asserts that homeopathy works, one must \u2014 for the sake of patients \u2014 object.\"<ref name=\"QQ_Spiegel_FaktIst\"/>\n\nThe impact of Grams' position in print media,<ref name=\"Welt_AlsW\u00e4reIch\"/><ref name=\"Spiegel_AusMeiner\"/><ref name=\"TAZ_Lebenstraum\"/><ref name=\"Zeit_DieNestbeschmutzerin\"/><ref name=\"BrandEins_DieKetzerin\"/><ref name=\"Stern_Warum\"/><ref name=\"LaborJournal_Methode\"/> radio, and television<ref name=\"GWUP_100Fragen\"/><ref name=\"FB_Eine\u00c4rztin\"/><ref name=\"WDR_\u00c4rztin\"/><ref name=\"ZDF_Jahrelang\"/> was an essential factor in the intensified German public discourse surrounding homeopathy since 2015.<ref name=\"DRadio_EineFrage\"/><ref name=\"SWR_Geldverswhwendung\"/><ref name=\"TAZ_Gesch\u00e4ft\"/><ref name=\"Motherboard_Warum\"/> She delivered a talk at SkepKon 2017 titled ''Enlightenment about pseudomedicine: What have skeptics achieved?''<ref name=\"SkepKon_2017\"/>\n\nAlong with author and homeopathy critic Norbert Aust, Grams co-founded the Information Network on Homeopathy (''Informationsnetzwerk Hom\u00f6opathie'' \u2014 INH) in 2016.<ref name=\"FAZ_Globull\"/><ref name=\"DAZ_INH\"/><ref name=\"Heilpraxisnet_Hom\u00f6opathie\"/><ref name=\"INH_Home\"/>\n\nShe lent her expertise as a member of the \"M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis\", a free association of scientists on the subject of \"Pseudomedicine in Public Health\",.as an author in support of the ''M\u00fcnster Memorandum on Practitioners of Alternative Medicine'', which aims to mitigate the potential for patient harm from therapists who lack academic medical education (''Heilpraktiker'' \u2014  literally ''healing practitioners'') by proposing a German regulatory framework to balance the concerns of patient autonomy and freedom of therapy against fairness to health insurance providers and insurees.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnsterMemo\"/><ref name=\"PN_M\u00fcnsterMemo\"/> She also co-authored the second publication of the M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis, the \"''M\u00fcnster Memorandum on Homeopathy''\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.muensteraner-kreis.de/homoeopathie.html|title=Memorandum Hom\u00f6opathie|last=M\u00fcnsteraner Kreis (M\u00fcnster Circle)|date=1 February 2018|website=www.muensteraner-kreis.de|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref> which appeared in 2018.\n\n==Reaction==\nGrams took up the publication of her 2015 book with the intention of stimulating self-reflection among those in the homeopathic orbit. She has expressed regret that this introspection had not yet happened until today.  Homeopaths who reviewed her first book didn't go to a factual discourse but have questioned the motivation behind her conversion (i.e., her change of mind based on rational arguments), mostly in a defamatory way.<ref name=\"Hom\u00f6Online_Falsch\"/><ref name=\"VKHD_Stellungnahme\"/> Grams reported that she had received a lot of rejection since becoming a public critic of homeopathy, often in the form of personal attacks, defamations, even death threats. She had even had to take advantage of police protection at events.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Merkelbach |first1=Annika |title=Natalie Grams:  Professional Homeopath to Professional Skeptic |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/natalie_grams_professional_homeopath_to_professional_skeptic |website=CSCIP |publisher=CFI |accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nTemporarily she held in mind writing a book collecting and discussing the many angry e-mails and comments she has received in response to her writing and activism. She hopes to reach people who share the false popular perception of homeopathic therapy as \"gentle\", \"empathetic\" and basically the \"better medicine\" and prompt them to re-examine that opinion on a factual basis.<ref name=\"TheESP_100\" />\n\n==Writings==\n\n* ''Hom\u00f6opathie neu gedacht \u2013 Was Patienten wirklich hilft'' (''Homeopathy Reconsidered \u2014 What Really Helps Patients'').

It is believed by many historians that the name 'Esan' (originally, 'E san fia') owes its origin to Bini (meaning, 'they have fled' or 'they jumped away'). 'Ishan' is an Anglicized form of 'Esan', the result of colonial Britain's inability to properly pronounce the name of this ethnic group. It is believed that similar corruption has affected such Esan names as ubh\u1eb9kh\u1eb9 (now 'obeche' tree), uloko (now 'iroko' tree), Abhuluim\u1eb9n (now 'Aburime'), etc. Efforts have however been made to return to status quo ante.\n\nFor academic purpose, Esan refers to\n# the ethnic group that occupies central Edo State;\n# (''plural'' unchanged) a person or the people collectively from this ethnic group;\n# the language of these people which, linguistically, is of the Kwa subdivision of the Niger-Congo language family;\n# something of, related to, or having Esan origin e.g. uro Esan (=Esan language), ot\u1ecd Esan (=Esan land), \u1ecdgh\u1eb9d\u1eb9 Esan (=Esan banana).\nIn the pre-colonial era, Esans carried a crow's foot tribal scar below their eyes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/anthropologicalr00thom |last=Thomas |first=Northcote Whitridge|location=London |publisher=Harrison |title= Anthropological Report on the Edo-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria (1910) |access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Esanland}}\n{{Further|Esanland#History}}\n\n===Pre-historical/classical period===\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0 |url-access=registration |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalarchae0000unse_g7b0/page/178 178]\u2013180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015|title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |year=1998 }}</ref> These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests.

In 1460, [[Oba Ewuare]] passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking.

The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nEsanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin\u2019s sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or ''ekhen.'' ''Ekhen'' procured cloth, ivory, peppers, and slaves for European merchants in [[Yorubaland]], Esanland, and [[Afenmai]]. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or ''ukpon ododo'' from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through ''ekhen''.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4852/5de30ab1be92ffa6f60947c0d6419899bfd4.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Nupe people]] in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the [[Kukuruku people]]s\u2019 lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans\u2019 favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. \nThe nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Esan warfare and colonization ===\n[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland proved to be harder to conquer than the [[Benin Kingdom]] because of its strong autonomy: Kingdoms chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued guerilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain\u2019s part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Modern-Agogo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The logo of the Esan Voice Association.|The traditional [[Agog\u00f4|agogo]] bell.

The Esan have prominent traditional rulers who keep order in a society where beauty and manners are intertwined. Despite the long-term impact of Christianity, the Esan are largely traditional and a large number practice traditional beliefs in the form of worship of ancestral spirits and other gods. A large percentage of Esan are Christians, mostly Catholic and recently of other denominations. Esan has various dialects all of which stem from [[Bini people|Bini]] and there is still close affinity between the Esan and the [[Bini people|Bini]], which leads to the common saying \"Esan ii gbi \u1eb8do\" meaning, Esan does not harm the \u1eb8do (i.e. Bini). There have been other translation of that saying, Esan gbe Edo which means Esan have conquered Bini.\n\nTraditional Esan religion has many similarities to traditional Edo religion, due to the Esan migration to the northeast during the 15th century from the [[Benin Empire]]. There are many deities of the Esan religion:\n* [[Osanobua]], the main Edo-Esan god. This name for God was brought over to Christianity and its missionaries, and thus the translation for God in Esanland is [[Osanobua]].\n* [[Olokun]]\n* [[Eshu|Esu]], the Esan trickster god. This god is shared with Yoruba and Edo myth. The name Esu was used as a translation for [[Satan]] by Christian missionaries.\n* [[Osun]], the Esan god of medicine.

'Ishan' is an Anglicized form of 'Esan', the result of colonial Britain's inability to properly pronounce the name of this ethnic group.

The battles came into the Esans\u2019 favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. \nThe nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Esan warfare and colonization ===\n[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland proved to be harder to conquer than the [[Benin Kingdom]] because of its strong autonomy: Kingdoms chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued geurilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain\u2019s part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Modern-Agogo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The logo of the Esan Voice Association.|The traditional [[Agog\u00f4|agogo]] bell.

The Esan have prominent traditional rulers who keep order in a society where beauty and manners are intertwined. Despite the long-term impact of Christianity, the Esan are largely traditional and a large number practice traditional beliefs in the form of worship of ancestral spirits and other gods. A large percentage of Esan are Christians, mostly Catholic and recently of other denominations. Esan has various dialects all of which stem from [[Bini people|Bini]] and there is still close affinity between the Esan and the [[Bini people|Bini]], which leads to the common saying \"Esan ii gbi \u1eb8do\" meaning, Esan does not harm the \u1eb8do (i.e. Bini). There have been other translation of that saying, Esan gbe Edo which means Esan have conquered Bini.\n\nTraditional Esan religion has many similarities to traditional Edo religion, due to the Esan migration to the northeast during the 15th century from the [[Benin Empire]]. There are many deities of the Esan religion:\n* [[Osanobua]], the main Edo-Esan god. This name for God was brought over to Christianity and its missionaries, and thus the translation for God in Esanland is [[Osanobua]].\n* [[Olokun]]\n* [[Eshu|Esu]], the Esan trickster god. This god is shared with Yoruba and Edo myth. The name Esu was used as a translation for [[Satan]] by Christian missionaries.\n* [[Osun]], the Esan god of medicine. This is where the surname Okosun, or son of medicine, originated from.\n\n== Esan Local Government Areas in Edo State ==\nThe autonomous clans/kingdoms in Esan land are currently administratively arranged as follows under the current five local government areas:\n# [[Esan-North-East]] LGA, Uromi: Uromi and Uzea\n# Esan Central LGA, Irrua: Irrua, Ugbegun, Opoji, Ewu, Ebudin\n# Esan West LGA, [[Ekpoma]]: Ekpoma, Iruekpen, Idoa, Ogwa, Urohi, Ukhun, Egoro and Ujiogba\n# Esan South East LGA, Ubiaja: Ubiaja, Ewohimi, Emu, Ohordua, \u1eb8watto, Okhuesan, Orowa, Ugboha, Oria, lllushi, Onogholo, Inyenlen\n# [[Igueben]] LGA, Igueben: Igueben, [[Ebelle]], Amaho, \u1eb8wossa, Udo, Ekpon, Ugun, Okalo,\n\n==See also==\n* [[Esan language]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T%20&%20T/T%20&%20T-04-0-000-000-2006-Web/T%20&%20T-04-1-001-076-2006-Abst-PDF/T%20&%20T-04-1-047-051-2006-077-Okoduwa-A-I/T%20&%20T-04-1-047-051-2006-077-Okoduwa-A-I-text.pdf Gerontocracy of Esan people]\n* {{cite journal |last=Okosun |first=Anthony |date= 11 July 2013 |title= Edo Civilization, Esan War Machine and the Founding of Lagos(Expanded and Revised)|url=http://www.nigeriavillagesquare.com/articles/edo-civilization-esan-war-machine-and-the-founding-of-lagos-expanded-and-revised5.html |journal= Nigeria Village Square |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=22 November 2014}}\n* {{cite journal |date= 10 July 2018 |title= Esan TV |url=http://www.esan.tv/ }}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n'''General'''\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Esan_Native_Laws_and_Customs.html?id=VHactgAACAAJ|title=Esan Native Laws and Customs: With Ethnological Studies of the Esan People\n|last=Okojie |first=Christopher Gbelokoto |author2=Arhuidese, J.

{"title_page": "List of TaleSpin episodes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe following is an episode list for the [[Disney]] animated television series ''[[TaleSpin]]''. The majority of the series and storylines are stand-alones and bear little significance in the order they are aired. The only recurrent themes are Baloo's drive to save money in order to repurchase his plane (the ''Sea Duck'') and Rebecca's desire to make a profitable living. As with many animated series of the time, there was no formal conclusion to the series. A comic ran for a short period and was then discontinued as well.\n\nSelect episodes were first aired on [[The Disney Channel]] in the spring of 1990, as a preview for the series; these episodes' Disney Channel airdates are given separately.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#FF6131\n|overall= \n|title=\n|aux1=\n|aux1T=Animation Director(S)\n|writer=\n|aux2=\n|aux2T=Storyboard\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list  | LineColor = FF6131\n |EpisodeNumber=01-02-03-04\n |Title=[[Plunder & Lightning]]: Episodes 1 through 4\n |DirectedBy=[[Robert Taylor (animator)|Robert Taylor]], [[John Kimball]], Richard Trueblood and [[Bob Zamboni]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Alan Burnett]], [[Len Uhley]] and [[Mark Zaslove]]\n |Aux2=Viki Anderson, Larry Eikleberry, Sharon Forward, Warren Greenwood, [[Bob Kline]], John Norton, Frank Paur, David Schwartz, Lonnie Thompson, Hank Tucker, Wendell Washer and Roy Wilson\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1990|09|7}}<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web|title=Special two-hour television feature 'Tale Spin: Plunder and Lightning' set to launch Disney's new animated series.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8739952.html|work=press release|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=August 14, 1990}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304784/|title=\"TaleSpin\" Plunder & Lightning (TV episode 1990) - IMDb|publisher= IMDb.com |date=|accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=In the [[series premiere]], Baloo, an air cargo pilot, meets Kit Cloudkicker, a 12-year-old [[orphan]], and takes him on as his navigator.

A comic ran for a short period and was then discontinued as well.\n\nSelect episodes were first aired on [[The Disney Channel]] in the spring of 1990, as a preview for the series; these episodes' Disney Channel airdates are given separately.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#FF6131\n|overall= \n|title=\n|aux1=\n|aux1T=Animation Director(S)\n|writer=\n|aux2=\n|aux2T=Storyboard\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list  | LineColor = FF6131\n |EpisodeNumber=01-02-03-04\n |Title=[[Plunder & Lightning]]: Episodes 1 through 4\n |DirectedBy=[[Robert Taylor]], [[John Kimball]], Richard Trueblood and [[Bob Zamboni]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Alan Burnett]], [[Len Uhley]] and [[Mark Zaslove]]\n |Aux2=Viki Anderson, Larry Eikleberry, Sharon Forward, Warren Greenwood, [[Bob Kline]], John Norton, Frank Paur, David Schwartz, Lonnie Thompson, Hank Tucker, Wendell Washer and Roy Wilson\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1990|09|7}}<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web|title=Special two-hour television feature 'Tale Spin: Plunder and Lightning' set to launch Disney's new animated series.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8739952.html|work=press release|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=August 14, 1990}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304784/|title=\"TaleSpin\" Plunder & Lightning (TV episode 1990) - IMDb|publisher= IMDb.com |date=|accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=In the [[series premiere]], Baloo, an air cargo pilot, meets Kit Cloudkicker, a 12-year-old [[orphan]], and takes him on as his navigator.

It is composed of five [[Local Government Areas]] in [[Edo State]]. Esanland lies west of the banks of the [[Niger River]]. It is bordered by [[Kogi State]], [[Delta State]], Edo South Senatorial District, and Edo North Senatorial District. Esanland covers about 2,800 square kilometers and is home to over half a million people. The  [[Esan people]] and culture of Esanland are generally homogenous.\n\nEsanland has been inhabited since the late [[Iron Age]], by hunter-gatherers from the [[Nok culture]]{{cn|date=December 2019}}. The hunter gatherers formed a society in northern Esanland until the 12th century. In the 15th century, indigenes from the Great Benin Empire moved to Esanland and renewed Edo-Esan cultural bonds as the Benin were the Royal blood and Emperor controlling the Southern Hemisphere.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Esan nations often worked either in tandem or subordination towards the Benin Empire, sending soldiers to the Benin army and treating their rulers as dukes to the Oba of Benin.\n\nTrade  with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] brought modern innovations such as [[Dane gun]]s and [[Spoon|spoons]], and new crops.\n\nIndependent rule in Esanland continued into the 1800s, until [[United Kingdom|the British]] claimed the entire region for the [[Royal Niger Company]] as part of the colony [[Nigeria]]. Local opposition to the conquest was vocal, and ''enijie'' such as King [[Ogbidi Okojie]] of Uromi banded together their soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to fight British rule. After the British takeover, independence movements sprung up. Leaders in Esanland such as [[Anthony Enahoro]] successfully campaigned for independence, which was granted to the whole of Nigeria. Since independence, Esanland has suffered from poor infrastructure and an attempted takeover in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] by [[Biafra]].\n\n==Etymology==\nEsanland originates from the term ''E san fia'' or ''they have fled'' in Edo language, referring to the flight of refugees from the [[Benin Empire]] to the surrounding forest that make up the original Esans.\n\n==History==\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years.<ref name=HAIN>{{cite book |title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Historical_Archaeology_in_Nigeria.html?id=yYGmzjnR3vsC |editor=Wesler, Kit W. |date=1998 |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=178\u2013180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref> These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as [[Etsako language|Etsako]] and [[Emai language|Owan]] than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with [[Edo language|Edo]]. These \"proto-Edoid\" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered.\n\nStarting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire.<ref name=HAIN /> They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties.

In 1460, [[Oba Ewuare]] passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking.

The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.\n\nEsanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin's sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or ''ekhen.'' ''Ekhen'' procured cloth, ivory, peppers and resources. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or ''ukpon ododo'' from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through ''ekhen''.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom.  The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Nupe people]] in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the [[Kukuruku people]]s\u2019 lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans\u2019 favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. The nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.\n\n=== Esan warfare and colonization  ===\n[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued guerilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain's part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.\n\n==Politics and government==\n\nEsan kingdoms were structured in a way that ''eguares'', or cities, were headed by ''enijies'', singular ''onojie''. ''Eguares'' were subdivided into villages, which were subdivided into ''idumu'' or quarters. Villages and ''idumu'' are headed by the oldest man in said village/''idumu'', the ''edionwele'' (plural ''odionwere'').\n\n==Geography==\nEsanland has an area of {{convert|2814.347|km2}}. It is dominated by the Ishan-Asaba Plateau in Midwestern Nigeria. This plateau is the source of many streams in the region.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Esan people}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n{{coord missing|Nigeria}}\n\n[[Category:Edo State]]\n[[Category:Cultural regions]]\n[[Category:Senatorial districts in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Regions of West Africa]]\n[[Category:Separatism in Nigeria]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = Esanland\n| native_name            = ''Ot\u1ecdesan''\n| native_name_lang       = \n| settlement_type        = Senatorial District\n| image_skyline          = \n| image_caption          = \n| image_flag             = \n| image_seal             = \n| image_shield           = \n| motto                  = ''\"Ma khato, ma khale, ise\"''<br>{{small|\"We shall live long, we shall reign, [[amen]]\"}}<br><ref name=EWC>{{cite web |url=http://www.esancongress.org/enc.html/|title=Welcome /Obo\u2019khian to the Esan World Congress|publisher=Esan World Congress|website=Esan World Congress |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n| image_map              = Esanland in Nigeria.png\n| map_caption            = Esanland (green) depicted in [[Nigeria]] (grey).\n<!-- | coordinates_display    = inline,title -->\n| coordinates_region     = \n| subdivision_type       = Country\n| subdivision_name       = {{NGR}}\n| subdivision_type1      = \n| subdivision_name1      = \n| subdivision_type2      = \n| subdivision_name2      = \n| established_title      = Foundation\n| established_date       = either 500 A.D. or the 15th century\n<!-- ALL fields with measurements have automatic unit conversion -->\n<!-- square kilometers -->\n| area_total_km2         = 2814.347\n| area_land_km2          = \n| area_water_km2         = \n| elevation_footnotes    = \n| elevation_m            = \n| population_footnotes   = \n| population_total       = 1.5 million \n| population_as_of       = 2006\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| population_demonym     = Esan\n| timezone1              = [[West Africa Time|WAT]]\n| utc_offset1            = +1\n| timezone1_DST          = \n| utc_offset1_DST        = \n| postal_code_type       = \n| postal_code            = \n| area_code_type         = \n| area_code              = \n}}\n'''Esanland''' ([[Esan language|Esan:]] ''Ot\u1ecdesan''), or the '''Edo Central Senatorial District''' is a [[cultural region]] and [[Government of Nigeria|senatorial district]] located in south-south Nigeria. It is composed of five [[Local Government Areas]] in [[Edo State]]. Esanland lies west of the banks of the [[Niger River]]. It is bordered by [[Kogi State]], [[Delta State]], Edo South Senatorial District, and Edo North Senatorial District. Esanland covers about 2,800 square kilometers and is home to over half a million people. The  [[Esan people]] and culture of Esanland are generally homogenous.\n\nEsanland has been inhabited since the late [[Iron Age]], by hunter-gatherers from the [[Nok culture]]{{cn|date=December 2019}}. The hunter gatherers formed a society in northern Esanland until the 12th century. In the 15th century, indigenes from the Great Benin Empire moved to Esanland and renewed Edo-Esan cultural bonds as the Benin were the Royal blood and Emperor controlling the Southern Hemisphere.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Esan nations often worked either in tandem or subordination towards the Benin Empire, sending soldiers to the Benin army and treating their rulers as dukes to the Oba of Benin.\n\nTrade  with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] brought modern innovations such as [[Dane gun]]s and [[Spoon|spoons]], and new crops.\n\nIndependent rule in Esanland continued into the 1800s, until [[United Kingdom|the British]] claimed the entire region for the [[Royal Niger Company]] as part of the colony [[Nigeria]]. Local opposition to the conquest was vocal, and ''enijie'' such as King [[Ogbidi Okojie]] of Uromi banded together their soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to fight British rule. After the British takeover, independence movements sprung up. Leaders in Esanland such as [[Anthony Enahoro]] successfully campaigned for independence, which was granted to the whole of Nigeria. Since independence, Esanland has suffered from poor infrastructure and an attempted takeover in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] by [[Biafra]].\n\n==Etymology==\nEsanland originates from the term ''E san fia'' or ''they have fled'' in Edo language, referring to the flight of refugees from the [[Benin Empire]] to the surrounding forest that make up the original Esans.\n\n==History==\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years.<ref name=HAIN>{{cite book |title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Historical_Archaeology_in_Nigeria.html?id=yYGmzjnR3vsC |editor=Wesler, Kit W. |date=1998 |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=178\u2013180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref> These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as [[Etsako language|Etsako]] and [[Emai language|Owan]] than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with [[Edo language|Edo]]. These \"proto-Edoid\" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered.\n\nStarting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire.<ref name=HAIN /> They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties. These enclosures were, at maximum, three to five kilometers in diameter, and demarcated residential and agricultural property.

Although they bear a striking resemblance to ex-[[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Kola class frigate]]s, they are unrelated to any Russian or Chinese design.<ref name=\"Institute\" /> The class was originally fitted with a trainable triple 21 inch torpedo launcher, which was replaced in the mid-1980s with fixed [[Styx missile]] launchers taken from [[Osa class missile boat]]s. The design is inherently dangerous, and even a minor missile failure would result in significant damage to the ship.<ref name=\"Institute\">{{cite book | title=Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World: Their Ships, Aircraft and Systems | publisher=Naval Institute Press | author=Wertheim, Eric | year=2007 | location=Annapolis | pages=424 | isbn=978-1-59114-955-2}}</ref>\n\n==Upgrades==\nAt least one Najin-class ship appears to upgraded with much more modern weaponry in 2014.
