After her marriage, Mary misrepresented her year of birth, declaring it as 1907 when it was actually 1906, hence conflicting birth dates in various sources. Her ''New York Times'' obituary makes the same error, along with numerous reference works.</ref>  was an American [[journalist]], [[playwright]] and children's novelist, known primarily for writing the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] play ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', later adapted for film starring [[James Stewart]].\n\nShe wrote fourteen plays, two children's novels, and one screenplay, and worked seven years at the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' as a journalist. Three of her plays were made into Hollywood films: ''[[Sorority House (film)|Sorority House]]'' (1939), ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'' (1950), and ''[[Bernardine (film)|Bernardine]]'' (1957).\n\n==Early years==\nBorn '''Mary Agnes McDonough Coyle''' in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1906, Chase remained in Denver her entire life. She grew up Irish Catholic and poor in the [[working class]] Baker neighborhood of Denver, not far from the railroad tracks.<ref>Wallis Reef, \"She Didn't Write It For Money---She Says\", ''The Saturday Evening Post'', Sept 1, 1945, p. 109</ref>\n\nShe was greatly influenced by the Irish myths related to her by her mother, Mary Coyle, and her four uncles, Timothy, James, John, and Peter. Charlie Coyle, her older brother, had a strong impact on her sense of comedy, as she imitated his natural gifts at mimicry, one-liners, and comic routines.<ref>Mary Coyle Chase, personal letter to Helen Cotton, Nov 9, 1971</ref>  He went on to become a circus clown.\n\nIn 1921, she graduated from [[West High School (Denver)|West High School]] in Denver and spent two years studying at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and the [[University of Denver]] without getting a degree.<ref>Frances Melrose, \"Mary Chase: Reporter to Playwright\", ''Rocky Mountain News'', Feb 27, 1977, p. 8</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1924, she began her career as a journalist on the ''Denver Times'' and ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', leaving the ''News'' (which the ''Denver Times'' was folded into in 1926) in 1931 to write plays, do freelance reporting work, and raise a family. At the ''News'', she started writing on the society pages, but soon became a feature writer, reporting the news from a sob sister, emotional angle, becoming part of the news itself as a comic figure, \"our Lil' Mary\", or writing funny, flapper era pieces as part of a series of \"Charlie & Mary\" stories (Charlie Wunder drew the cartoons and Mary wrote the text).\n\nIn the 1920s, reporters typically worked in ''[[The Front Page]]'' tradition: putting in long hours, drinking hard, and stopping at nothing to beat the competition to a story. Running around Denver with photographer Harry Rhoads in a [[Model T Ford]], she recalled, \"In the course of a day, Harry and I might begin at the Police Court, go to a murder trial at the West Side Court, cover a party in the evening at Mrs. Crawford Hill's mansion, and rush to a shooting at 11pm.\"<ref>Frances Melrose, ''Rocky Mountain News'', Sept 27, 1998, p. 23D</ref> She ended her journalistic career writing in the society pages where she had begun, perhaps as punishment for a practical joke that she played upon an unsuspecting editor.<ref>Mary Coyle, ''Rocky Mountain News'', Oct. 25, 1925, Society Section, p. 1 and Mary Coyle, ''Rocky Mountain News'', Sept. 30, 1928, Section Two, p. 1</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the ''News'', in the 1930s Mary worked as a freelance correspondent for the United Press and the International News Service.<ref>Kathleen Gough, ''Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 228'': 'Twentieth Century American Dramatists', p. 40</ref> But her true love had always been the theater, so she began to write plays.\n\nIn 1936, her first play, ''Me Third'', was produced at the Baker Federal Theater in Denver as a part of the Roosevelt-era Works Progress Administration (WPA). In the spring of 1937, the play opened on Broadway, renamed as ''Now You've Done It'', but it failed to attract positive reviews and closed down after three weeks.<ref>John Mason Brown, ''New York Post'', March 6, 1937; Eleanor Harris, ''Cosmopolitan'', February 1954, p. 101</ref> In 1938, Mary wrote ''Chi House'', which was made into a Hollywood film by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] called ''[[Sorority House (film)|Sorority House]]'' (1939), starring [[Anne Shirley (actress)|Anne Shirley]] of ''Anne of Green Gables'' fame.<ref>Frank Nugent, New York Times website, http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E0DA113CE73ABC4052DFB3668382629EDE</ref>\n\nIn the early 1940s, she had a series of government, volunteer, and union jobs, serving as the Information Director for the National Youth Administration in Denver, doing volunteer work for the Colorado Foundation for the Advancement of Spanish Speaking Peoples, and working as the publicity director for the Denver branch of the [[Teamsters Union]].<ref>Frances Melrose, Rocky Mountain News, Feb. 27, 1977, p. 50</ref>\n\n==''Harvey''==\nDuring this time, she was working on the play ''Harvey'', which was very difficult for her to write and which went through numerous revisions, taking her two years to finish.<ref>Eleanor Harris, Cosmopolitan, Feb. 1954, p. 101</ref> On November 1, 1944, it opened on Broadway and was a smash hit, running for four and a half years, 1,775 performances, from Nov. 1, 1944 to Jan. 15, 1949.\n\nIn the history of Broadway productions (which stretches back to 1750), ''Harvey'' became the 35th longest-running show (musicals and plays) and, if only plays are counted, the 6th longest-running play on Broadway, after ''[[Life With Father]]'', ''[[Tobacco Road (play)|Tobacco Road]]'', ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]'', ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]'', and ''[[Gemini (play)|Gemini]]''. [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]] and [[James Stewart]] were the most famous actors to portray Elwood P. Dowd. [[Josephine Hull]] portrayed his increasingly concerned (and socially obsessed) sister on Broadway originally, and won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in the film. [[Ruth McDevitt]], [[Marion Lorne]], [[Helen Hayes]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]], among other actresses, also portrayed Veta either onstage or on television. James Stewart was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for the film version, but lost out to [[Jose Ferrer]] in the 1950 film version of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\".\n\nIn 1945, she won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Drama for ''Harvey''.<ref>New York Times, May 8, 1945, p. 1</ref> She is the only Coloradan to have won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama, and, in a field dominated by men, was the 4th woman to win the award, after [[Zona Gale]] (1921), [[Susan Glaspell]] (1931), and [[Zoe Akins]] (1935). From 1917-2013, only 14 women have won the Pulitzer in Drama.<ref>http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama</ref>\n\nImmediately after ''Harvey'', Mary tried to repeat her success on Broadway with the ''Next Half Hour'', a play based on an autobiographical novel she had written called ''The Banshee''. It failed after a three-week run.\n\nIn 1950, ''Harvey'' was made into a [[Universal Studios]] film, starring James Stewart, with Mary collaborating with [[Oscar Brodney]] in writing the screenplay.<ref>IMDb website, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042546/fullcredits#writers</ref> In 1952 and 1953, she launched ''[[Bernardine (play)|Bernardine]]'' and ''Mrs McThing'' on Broadway. Both plays were moderately successful. ''[[Bernardine (film)|Bernardine]]'' was made into a film, starring [[Pat Boone]] and [[Janet Gaynor]] (in Gaynor's last film role). In 1958 and 1968, she wrote two children's stories, ''Loretta Mason Potts'' and ''The Wicked, Wicked Ladies in the Haunted House''. A 1961 production of her play, ''Midgie Purvis'', starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]], flopped.  A 1970 ''Harvey'' revival, starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Helen Hayes]], was successful and ran for 79 performances while a 1981 musical adaptation of ''Harvey'', entitled ''Say Hello to Harvey'', failed after a six-week run amid negative reviews in Toronto.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1928, Mary married Robert L. Chase, a fellow reporter at the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''.<ref>''Rocky Mountain News'', June 8, 1928, p. 7</ref> Bob was a seasoned, \"hard news\" reporter, having worked at the ''Denver Express'' since 1922, covering the robbery of the US Mint and fighting against the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Colorado state and local politics. The ''Express'' eventually merged with the ''Rocky Mountain News'' and Bob went on to a 47-year newspaper career at the paper, becoming managing editor and then associate editor. He was a founding member in 1936 (and named vice-president) of the Denver chapter of the American Newspaper Guild,  a national labor union representing editors and reporters.<ref>Bill Hosokawa, ''Thunder in the Rockies'', William Morrow & Co, 1976, p. 200-201</ref>\n\nIn 1932, their first son, Michael, was born, followed by [[Colin Robert Chase|Colin]] in 1935, and then Barry Jerome (Jerry) in 1937. Michael became the director of public television in New York, Colin was a professor of English Literature at the [[University of Toronto]], and Jerry worked as a college academic counselor in New York City, and wrote the play, ''Cinderella Wore Combat Boots''.\n\nWhile working on the musical adaptation, ''Say Hello to Harvey'', in 1981, Mary Coyle Chase suffered a heart attack suddenly at her home in Denver and died at the age of 75.\n\n==Recent events==\nIn August 2009, [[Steven Spielberg]] announced that he was planning a remake of ''Harvey'', with [[Tom Hanks]] or [[Will Smith]] playing Elwood Dowd.<ref>https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&articleid=VR1118006812&categoryid=13 and http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006812.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=spielberg+harvey</ref> By December he had abandoned the project, the main reason being the difficulty of finding a star to play the lead role. [[Tom Hanks]] was not interested in walking in the shoes of the beloved, iconic star, [[James Stewart]]. [[Robert Downey Jr.]] was in the mix for several months, but he wanted changes to the script and Spielberg decided to pull the plug, feeling that the two were not on the same creative wavelength. This was not the first attempt at a ''Harvey'' remake. In 2002, Dimension Films, a division of [[Miramax]], and MGM tried to get a film going with [[John Travolta]] playing the lead. This project ended in 2004, with [[Michael Eisner]]'s expulsion of the Weinstein brothers from Miramax over the release of ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' by [[Michael Moore]].\n\nOn June 14, 2012, the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] opened its Broadway revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'' to positive reviews at the [[Studio 54]] Theatre.<ref>'Harvey' hops its way to Broadway this summer at http://www.ticketnews.com/news/harvey-hops-its-way-to-Broadway-this-summer061220949</ref>  The production starred [[Emmy Award]] winner [[Jim Parsons]] (''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''), returning to Broadway after a successful run in the revival of ''[[The Normal Heart]]'' in the summer of 2011.  ''Harvey'' is directed by Scott Ellis and also features [[Charles Kimbrough]] (Emmy nominee, ''[[Murphy Brown]]'') in the role of psychiatrist William Chumley and [[Jessica Hecht]] (''[[Dan in Real Life]]'') as sister Veta.  ''Harvey'' was scheduled to run until August 5.\n\n==Honors==\n* 1944: William McLeod Raine Award, Colorado Authors' League\n* 1945: Pulitzer Prize in Drama\n* 1947: Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Denver\n* 1960: Receives the Monte Meacham Award from the Children's Theater Conference of the AETA (American Educational Theater Association).\n* 1985: Inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]], along with [[Golda Meir]], [[Margaret Brown|the \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown]], and [[Mamie Eisenhower]].\n* 1999: Inducted into the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame alongside [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] and [[Glenn Miller]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{anchor|plays}}\n; Plays\n* ''Me Third'' (1936)\n* ''Sorority House'' (1938)\n* ''Slip Of A Girl'' (1941)\n* ''Harvey'' (1944)\n* ''The Next Half Hour'' (1945)\n* ''Bernardine'' (1952)\n* ''Lolita'' (1954)\n* ''Mrs. McThing'' (1954) (also presented on television)\n* ''Midgie Purvis'' (1961)\n* ''The Prize Play'' (1961)\n* ''The Dog Sitters'' (1963)\n* ''Mickey'' (1969)\n* ''Cocktails With Mimi'' (1974)\n* ''The Terrible Tattoo Parlor'' (1981)\n\n; Children's Stories\n* ''Loretta Mason Potts'' (1958)\n* ''The Wicked, Wicked Ladies In the Haunted House'' (1968)\n\n==Film adaptations==\n* ''[[Sorority House (1939 film)|Sorority House]]'' (1939)\n* ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950)\n* ''[[Bernardine (film)|Bernardine]]'' (1957)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/000603195/catalog Mary Chase papers, 1928-1981.][[Houghton Library]], Harvard University\n* [http://coloradoauthors.org/about-cal/history-of-cal/mary-coyle-chase/ Colorado Authors' League website]\n* {{Find a Grave|10447895}}\n* {{IBDB name}}\n* {{IMDb name|153808|Mary Chase}}\n* [http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/chase-mary.html Mary Chase] at the Doolee Playwright's Database\n* [http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv53706 Guide to the Mary Chase papers at the University of Oregon]\n* {{Cite web|title=Mary McDonough Coyle Chase|url=http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_char_chase.asp|work=Denver's History|publisher=City and County of Denver|year=2009|accessdate=2009-02-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201062123/http://denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_char_chase.asp|archivedate=2009-02-01}}\n*[http://digital.library.du.edu/findingaids/view?docId=ead/m125.xml;query=;brand=default Guide to the Mary Coyle Chase Collection at the University of Denver.] Retrieved 2014-09-26.\n*[http://www.cogreatwomen.org/project-tag/casteel/ Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]\n{{PulitzerPrize DramaAuthors 1926-1950}}\n{{Colorado Women's Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chase, Mary Coyle}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1981 deaths]]\n[[Category:American women journalists]]\n[[Category:American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Writers from Denver]]\n[[Category:Pulitzer Prize for Drama winners]]\n[[Category:American women screenwriters]]\n[[Category:Rocky Mountain News people]]\n[[Category:20th-century American women writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:American women dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:American children's writers]]\n[[Category:Women children's writers]]\n[[Category:University of Denver alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{other people||Mary Chase (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox writer\n| name             = Mary Coyle Chase\n| image            = Mary Coyle Chase.jpg\n| birth_name       = Mary Agnes McDonough Coyle\n| birth_date       = {{Birth date|df=y|1906|02|25}}\n| birth_place      = [[Denver, Colorado]], U.S.\n| death_date       = {{death date and age|df=y|1981|10|20|1906|02|25}}\n| death_place      = Denver, Colorado, U.S.\n| notableworks     = ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''\n| spouse           = Robert L.

It was a very poor environment. He went on to explain how meager his family's situation was, and spoke on how his family used a foot tub with ice in it as a fridge. His mother Emma Smith, reflected upon the day that Tavoris Cloud declared that he was going to take care of this situation. He was around 14\u201315 years of age. Alonzo Johnson (Boxing Coach), trained and housed Tavoris during his high school years. Tavoris trained with Alonzo Johnson since his amateur days. Johnson worked in his corner alongside head trainer Al Bonanni during Cloud's professional fights.\n\n==Amateur career==\nCloud competed at the 2002 [[United States national amateur boxing championships|U.S. national amateur championships]], losing in the final of the [[light heavyweight]] bracket to [[Curtis Stevens (boxer)|Curtis Stevens]].<ref>[http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2002.html \"USA2002\"]. amateur-boxing.strefa.pl. Retrieved November 18, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nOn August 8, 2008, at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom]] in [[Chicago]], Cloud defeated former WBO [[Light Heavyweight]] Champion [[Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez]] by [[technical knockout]] in the tenth round in an [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Light Heavyweight title eliminator.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Chavez\n  | first =Jacob\n  | title =Cloud stops Gonzalez in ten!\n  | publisher =Fightnews.com\n  | date =2008-08-08\n  | url =http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines//EkElkuZuyuUuGozfxy.html\n  | accessdate =2008-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822080655/http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines/EkElkuZuyuUuGozfxy.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}</ref> Cloud set the tempo of the fight early, hurting Gonzalez with a right [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] in dominating the first round. It was more of the same in the next two rounds, although Gonzalez made the third round the most competitive. He kept the fight in the middle of the ring, but Cloud kept sending him back with [[uppercut]]s and left [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]]. With Gonz\u00e1lez taking a beating for the majority of the fight, in round ten, the referee stopped the fight after Cloud landed a right hand.\n\n===IBF light heavyweight champion===\nTavoris won the IBF Light Heavyweight title against the durable [[Clinton Woods]] by way of a 12-round unanimous decision after former champion [[Chad Dawson]] vacated the belt (it is argued in the boxing community that Chad Dawson vacated the IBF belt to avoid Tavoris Cloud, whom he represented the country with during his amateur career. However, this argument can not be concluded as fact). The fight against Clinton Woods took place on August 28, 2009. Cloud threw well over 1000 punches in the fight which is well over the average for that weight division and won the fight by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\n\nCloud defeated Glen Johnson by unanimous decision on August 7, 2010.\n\nCloud faced the Colombian knockout artist Fulgencio Zuniga (24-5-1 (20 KO)) for a title defense and earned a unanimous decision.\n\nFollowing the Zuniga win, Cloud improved his record with another TKO decision over Yusaf Mack.\n\nCloud defeated Spaniard Gabriel Campillo via split decision. The win stirred up controversy, with fans scoring the bout for Campillo. However, unbeknown to Fans, \"the referee said that there are no standing eight counts...\"- A statement Tavoris Cloud made to Lem Satterfield when interviewed for ''The Ring Magazine's'' website ''The Ring''. Tavoris Cloud further stated, \"when we got in there the first round, and I dropped him, the referee pulled me out of the way and started to give him an eight count. I mean, that's the fight right there.\"\n\nCloud's next opponent was thought to be Former World Champion and Commonwealth Games Gold Medalist: Jean Pascal, with a scheduled fight date of August 11, 2012, but Pascal pulled out of the fight last minute due to a hand injury suffered in training. Cloud adamantly believes the injury was faked.\n\n===Consecutive defeats to Hopkins, Stevenson, Beterbiev===\nCloud later took on Bernard Hopkins on March 9, 2013 at the Barclays center in Brooklyn and lost his IBF Championship via Unanimous Decision (UD).\n\nIn the following September Cloud challenged Adonis Stevenson for the WBC light-heavyweight title, and took a beating before quitting in his corner.\n\nOn September 27, 2014, Cloud faced Dagestan contender [[Artur Beterbiev]].  Right from the start Cloud was outmatched and unable to cope with the power of his vastly larger foe, getting dropped three times in the first round before finally being for the last time early in the second.  Cloud was unable to beat referee Michael Griffin's count, making this his third consecutive loss.\n\n==Professional boxing

Retrieved November 18, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nOn August 8, 2008, at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom]] in [[Chicago]], Cloud defeated former WBO [[Light Heavyweight]] Champion [[Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez]] by [[technical knockout]] in the tenth round in an [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Light Heavyweight title eliminator.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Chavez\n  | first =Jacob\n  | title =Cloud stops Gonzalez in ten!\n  | publisher =Fightnews.com\n  | date =2008-08-08\n  | url =http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines//EkElkuZuyuUuGozfxy.html\n  | accessdate =2008-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822080655/http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines/EkElkuZuyuUuGozfxy.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}</ref> Cloud set the tempo of the fight early, hurting Gonzalez with a right [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] in dominating the first round. It was more of the same in the next two rounds, although Gonzalez made the third round the most competitive. He kept the fight in the middle of the ring, but Cloud kept sending him back with [[uppercut]]s and left [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]]. With Gonz\u00e1lez taking a beating for the majority of the fight, in round ten, the referee stopped the fight after Cloud landed a right hand.\n\n===IBF light heavyweight champion===\nTavoris won the IBF Light Heavyweight title against the durable [[Clinton Woods]] by way of a 12-round unanimous decision after former champion [[Chad Dawson]] vacated the belt (it is argued in the boxing community that Chad Dawson vacated the IBF belt to avoid Tavoris Cloud, whom he represented the country with during his amateur career. However, this argument can not be concluded as fact). The fight against Clinton Woods took place on August 28, 2009. Cloud threw well over 1000 punches in the fight which is well over the average for that weight division and won the fight by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\n\nCloud defeated Glen Johnson by unanimous decision on August 7, 2010.\n\nCloud faced the Columbian knockout artist Fulgencio Zuniga (24-5-1 (20 KO)) for a title defense and earned a unanimous decision.\n\nFollowing the Zuniga win, Cloud improved his record with another TKO decision over Yusaf Mack.\n\nCloud defeated Spaniard Gabriel Campillo via split decision. The win stirred up controversy, with fans scoring the bout for Campillo. However, unbeknown to Fans, \"the referee said that there are no standing eight counts...\"- A statement Tavoris Cloud made to Lem Satterfield when interviewed for ''The Ring Magazine's'' website ''The Ring''. Tavoris Cloud further stated, \"when we got in there the first round, and I dropped him, the referee pulled me out of the way and started to give him an eight count. I mean, that's the fight right there.\"\n\nCloud's next opponent was thought to be Former World Champion and Commonwealth Games Gold Medalist: Jean Pascal, with a scheduled fight date of August 11, 2012, but Pascal pulled out of the fight last minute due to a hand injury suffered in training. Cloud adamantly believes the injury was faked.\n\n===Consecutive defeats to Hopkins, Stevenson, Beterbiev===\nCloud later took on Bernard Hopkins on March 9, 2013 at the Barclays center in Brooklyn and lost his IBF Championship via Unanimous Decision (UD).\n\nIn the following September Cloud challenged Adonis Stevenson for the WBC light-heavyweight title, and took a beating before quitting in his corner.\n\nOn September 27, 2014, Cloud faced Dagestan contender [[Artur Beterbiev]].  Right from the start Cloud was outmatched and unable to cope with the power of his vastly larger foe, getting dropped three times in the first round before finally being for the last time early in the second.  Cloud was unable to beat referee Michael Griffin's count, making this his third consecutive loss.\n\n==Professional boxing

It is also the seat of the [[Maradi Department]] and an Urban Commune.\n\n==History==\nOriginally part of [[Katsina]], a [[Hausa people|Hausa]] state, it became independent in the 19th century.<ref>Abdourahmane Idrissa, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Niger'', Scarecrow Press, USA, 2012, p. 316</ref> From the early 19th century, Maradi was home to one of several Hausa traditional rump states, formed by rulers and nobility who fled the rise of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref name=\"Bradt\">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Niger'', pgs. 203-212</ref> Elements of the Katsina ruling class continued to claim the area as the seat of a Katsina state in exile ruled by the ''Sarkin Katsina Maradi''. Maradi was constrained by the more powerful [[Gobir]] exilic state to the west, the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] based at [[Zinder]] to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw the bloody destruction of the town by the [[Voulet-Chanoine Mission]], but later the town recovered to become an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s.\n\nThe expansion of the city in the first half of the 20th century was dynamic, albeit modest, with the population nearly doubling between 1911 and 1950.<ref name=source1>[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/pt5/travaux_d/23390.pdf ''Les alhazai de Maradi \u2013 l\u2019histoire d\u2019une groupe de riche marchands saheliens'']. Emmanuel Gregoire. \u00c9ditions de I'ORSTOM. 1990.</ref> Up until 1945, the ancient city of Maradi was located in the valley bordering the [[Goulbi N'Maradi]], a seasonal waterway with its source in Nigeria. The urban area, roughly circular in shape, was protected by a mud wall with four doors; the ancient city was flooded by this river at the end of the rainy season of 1945. To avoid future inundation, the French colonial administration decided then to adjust the urban layout.

Maradi was constrained by the more powerful [[Gobir]] exilic state to the west, the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] based at [[Zinder]] to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw the bloody destruction of the town by the [[Voulet-Chanoine Mission]], but later the town recovered to become an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s. \n\nThe expansion of the city in the first half of the 20th century was dynamic, albeit modest, with the population nearly doubling between 1911 and 1950.<ref name=source1>[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/pt5/travaux_d/23390.pdf ''Les alhazai de Maradi \u2013 l\u2019histoire d\u2019une groupe de riche marchands saheliens''].

Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed.<ref name=\"DenmanJoyner\">Clarence P. Denman Collection, Box 1, Files 1\u201415, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries; Arista Joyner Papers, GA 149, Folder 6, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries.</ref> Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.<ref name=\"Saxon\">Saxon, G.D., \u201cTransitions: A Centennial History of the University of Texas at Arlington,\u201d The UTA Press, Arlington, Texas, 1995.</ref>\n\nRankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901\u20131902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\n[[File:Carlisle Military Academy, 1911.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye painting of Carlisle Military Academy, 1911]]\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the '''Carlisle Military Academy''' in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built.

[[AT&T Stadium]], [[Globe Life Park]], Texas Live!, [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and [[International Bowling Museum]] are two miles to the northeast.\n\n===Main Campus architecture===\n[[File:UTAWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fountain on campus]]\nThe campus is organized on the city's former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. Decades of prodigious tree-planting and deliberate attention to landscape design have resulted in a shaded campus that is a pleasing pedestrian experience. Most streets in the campus core are closed and converted into pedestrian malls. The predominant east-west walk is the Second Street Mall, and the most important north-south passageway is Arlington Walk, extending from the Engineering Research Building on the north to the Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building on the south.\n\nThe oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 27.</ref> The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, '70s, and '80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. \"Reimagined Introvert\". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 60.</ref> An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson)<ref>Pratt, James. \"Pratt and Box:  Brief History of a Firm\". ''Texas Architect'', July/Aug 2011, page 12.</ref> which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; the Nursing Building is noted for its unusual triangular shape. [[Texas Hall]] (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and [[Nedderman Hall]] is a contributing structure with its large atrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uta.edu/digitalgallery/items/show/23329|title=[Untitled] \u00b7 UTA Libraries|website=library.uta.edu|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref> An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick.

''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 63.</ref> The Central Library and Texas Hall are examples of Mid-century Modern design. Attention to building design and the definition of outdoor spaces is evident with the [[postmodern]] additions of the Chemistry & Physics Building ([[Perkins + Will]]), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building ([[ZGF Architects]] with Page), [[College Park Center]] ([[HKS, Inc.]]), and Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building (ZGF with Page). The Chemistry & Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced [[planetarium]]s in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.org/listings/the-planetarium-at-ut-arlington/75/|title=The Planetarium at UT Arlington|website=www.arlington.org|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:CPC Dist.jpg|thumb|180px|College Park Center District]]\n\nThe north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as \"east campus\").\n\nSurface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods. The West Campus Parking Garage and the College Park parking garages on the northwest and northeast campus corners, respectively, provide some relief and advance the master plan goal of reducing surface parking. Green spaces, or outdoor rooms, have increased in the 2000s most notably with the creation of the Greene Research Quad, the Green at College Park, a sunken courtyard at Davis Hall, Brazos Park, and the Davis Street west campus edge.

Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed.<ref name=\"DenmanJoyner\">Clarence P. Denman Collection, Box 1, Files 1\u201415, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries; Arista Joyner Papers, GA 149, Folder 6, Special Collections Division, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries.</ref> Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.<ref name=\"Saxon\">Saxon, G.D., \u201cTransitions: A Centennial History of the University of Texas at Arlington,\u201d The UTA Press, Arlington, Texas, 1995.</ref>\n\nRankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901\u20131902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\n[[File:Carlisle Military Academy, 1911.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye painting of Carlisle Military Academy, 1911]]\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the '''Carlisle Military Academy''' in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.\n\nLawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, [[Henry Kirby Taylor]] moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called '''Arlington Training School'''.<ref name=\"AJ1\">Arlington Journal, May May 16, 23, and August 1, 1913.</ref> He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914\u20131915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land with 95 students enrolled.<ref name=\"ACatalog\">Arlington Training School Catalog, 1914\u20131915.</ref> The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916\u20131917 school year called '''Arlington Military Academy'''. Enrollment was apparently very low,<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.[[File:1941 NTAC Science Building (Preston Hall).jpg|thumb|left|The Science Building at the North Texas Agricultural College in 1941.

By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in College Station was overcrowded and had only one branch campus, Prairie View A&M.

After several years of efforts by President Frank Harrison to give students an opportunity to pick another theme, the UT System abolished rebels.<ref name=\"rebels\">Rebel Theme Controversy Collection, Box 1, Folders 3\u20136.</ref> The Maverick theme was adopted after a student vote in 1971.\n\n[[Wendell Nedderman]] served as acting president from 1972 to 1974 and president from 1974 to 1992. His tenure was characterized by increased growth and aspirations. In these years, the graduate student population increased from 936 to 4,200 and the overall university enrollment reached 25,135 students. Faculty research and publishing was emphasized along with the addition of doctoral programs in science, engineering, business, social work, and public and urban administration.<ref name=\"Saxon\"/> The Texas Select Committee on Higher Education recognized UT Arlington as an emerging research institution in 1987.<ref name=\"researchinst\">''The Shorthorn'', February 19, 1987.</ref>\nThe university experienced significant enrollment gains and rapid acceleration in research under the leadership of former presidents [[James D.

The physical campus became much more residential in character and numerous major academic and student life buildings were added.\n\n==Campuses==\n===Main Campus surroundings===\nThe 420 acre main campus is at the southern edge of downtown [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], which also includes the largest branch of the public library, [[Seat of local government|City Hall]], [[Theatre Arlington]], Levitt Pavilion, [[Arlington Museum of Art]], churches, and numerous types of businesses just south of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] line, around which the city was established.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Barnett Shale]] formation sits below the campus and has earned the university millions of dollars from natural gas production since 2008. These funds are used for scholarships, faculty recruitment, and campus infrastructure upgrades.<ref>[https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108094221/https://www.uta.edu/ucomm/mediarelations/press/2009/01/Gas-check-received.php |date=November 8, 2017 }} UT Arlington Receives First Natural Gas Royalty Check 2009-01-23, retrieved January 30, 2009</ref>\n\nAn unnamed branch of [[Johnson Creek (Texas)|Johnson Creek]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], runs along the southern portion of the campus. Cooper Street (which forms a part of [[Farm to Market Road 157]]) runs through the campus and provides access to Interstates [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]] and [[Interstate 30]]. [[AT&T Stadium]], [[Globe Life Park]], Texas Live!, [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and [[International Bowling Museum]] are two miles to the northeast.\n\n===Main Campus architecture===\n[[File:UTAWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fountain on campus]]\nThe campus is organized on the city's former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. Decades of prodigious tree-planting and deliberate attention to landscape design have resulted in a shaded campus that is a pleasing pedestrian experience. Most streets in the campus core are closed and converted into pedestrian malls. The predominant east-west walk is the Second Street Mall, and the most important north-south passageway is Arlington Walk, extending from the Engineering Research Building on the north to the Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building on the south.\n\nThe oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 27.</ref> The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, '70s, and '80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy.<ref>Hamilton, Todd. \"Reimagined Introvert\". ''Texas Architect'', May/June 2008, page 60.</ref> An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson)<ref>Pratt, James. \"Pratt and Box:  Brief History of a Firm\". ''Texas Architect'', July/Aug 2011, page 12.</ref> which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; the Nursing Building is noted for its unusual triangular shape. [[Texas Hall]] (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and [[Nedderman Hall]] is a contributing structure with its large atrium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uta.edu/digitalgallery/items/show/23329|title=[Untitled] \u00b7 UTA Libraries|website=library.uta.edu|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref> An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick. Metal panels have appeared in construction since the late 1990s.<ref>Hightower, J. Brantley. \"Quiet Standout\". ''Texas Architect'', Jan/Feb 2008, page 47.</ref>\n\nThe Central Library, designed by prominent 20th-century architect [[George Dahl]] (well known contributions include [[Art Deco]] buildings at [[Fair Park|Dallas Fair Park]]), forms one side of a Library Quad which may be regarded as the heart of campus.<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester. ''University of Texas at Arlington, the Campus History Series'' (Charleston:  Arcadia, 2015), p. 63.</ref> The Central Library and Texas Hall are examples of Mid-century Modern design. Attention to building design and the definition of outdoor spaces is evident with the [[postmodern]] additions of the Chemistry & Physics Building ([[Perkins + Will]]), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building ([[ZGF Architects]] with Page), [[College Park Center]] ([[HKS, Inc.]]), and Science & Engineering Innovation & Research Building (ZGF with Page). The Chemistry & Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced [[planetarium]]s in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlington.org/listings/the-planetarium-at-ut-arlington/75/|title=The Planetarium at UT Arlington|website=www.arlington.org|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:CPC Dist.jpg|thumb|180px|College Park Center District]]\n\nThe north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as \"east campus\").\n\nSurface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods.
