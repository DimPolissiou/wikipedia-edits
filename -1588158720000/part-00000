After that, it was used by [[Edvard Kardelj]] and [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] in the [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|Yugoslav war reparations claim sent to Germany]]. In its entry on Jasenovac, the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] says:\n<blockquote>Determining the number of victims is highly problematic, due to the destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism, which has been and remains influenced by ethnic tension, religious prejudice, and ideological conflict.

The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Ko\u010dovi\u0107, and 530,000 according to \u017derjavi\u0107, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (respectively). \u017derjavi\u0107 further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.\n\nThe [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji\u0107, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During World War II various [[Germany|German]] military commanders and civilian authorities gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed inside the territory of the Independent State of Croatia.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30, 1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}} The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta\u0161e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\",{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \"regarded Usta\u0161e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=565}}\n\n==Connections with the Catholic Church==\n{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e}}\nDuring 23 years of the existence of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941), the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \"... a massive press campaing was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central goverment's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate.

Like the Nazis, the Usta\u0161e deemed Jews, Romani, and Slavs to be sub-humans ([[Untermenschen]]). They endorsed the claims from German racial theorists that Croats were not Slavs but a Germanic race. Their genocides against Serbs, Jews, and Romani were thus expressions of Nazi racial ideology. However, the Usta\u0161e viewed the Bosniaks as \"Muslim Croats,\" not Slavs, and as a result did not persecute Muslim Bosniaks on the basis of race.<ref name=\"fischer\"/>\n\nIn addition to Nazi racial theory, the Usta\u0161e ideology incorporated [[fascism]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Croatian nationalism]].<ref name=\"kroatische\"/> The Usta\u0161e supported the creation of a [[Greater Croatia]] that would span the [[Drina]] River and extend to the border of [[Belgrade]].<ref>Meier, Viktor.

This variance stems from the fact that ''Usta\u0161e'' is the plural form of ''Usta\u0161a'' in the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].\n\nFiercely Roman Catholic, the Usta\u0161e espoused [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Islam]] as the religions of the Croats and Bosniaks and condemned [[Orthodox Christianity]], which was the main religion of the Serbs.

The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Ko\u010dovi\u0107, and 530,000 according to \u017derjavi\u0107, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (respectively). \u017derjavi\u0107 further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.\n\nThe [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims.

The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30, 1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}} The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church.

It also has a sixth form, [[Carmel College Sixth Form]] admitting about 150 students each year. Following an [[OFSTED]] inspection in 2013, Carmel was graded as outstanding in all categories. It is part of the Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust (formally Carmel Education Trust) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bishophogarthcet.org.uk/|title=Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>which includes 18 schools in the Darlington region.  \n\nThe current principal is Mike Shorten.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bishophogarthcet.org.uk/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet The Team \u2013 Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==Admissions==\nCarmel College is the town's only [[Catholic]] secondary school. It has four main feeder schools at Primary level. These are St Teresa's RC Primary, St Bede's RC Primary, St Augustine's RC Primary and Holy Family RC Primary. There is also another school, Abbey Road Junior School, which feeds Carmel; although this school is not Catholic, it is local to Carmel.

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sittingbourne Adult Education College - geograph.org.uk - 364022.jpg|thumb|left|The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College]]\n\nPlans for a boys' school in [[Borden, Kent|Borden]] began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer inhabitants of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]: [[Sheerness]] was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to [[Pengam]], South Wales, where the boys were to attend the [[Lewis School, Pengam|Lewis School]]. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, three updated war memorials were installed in the School vestibule, commemorating all those Old Bordenians known to have given their lives in the conflicts of the Twentieth Century (forty casualties in the First World War, sixty casualties in the Second World War, and single casualties in the Boer War, Korean War and Northern Ireland).\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThere is no uniform, students attend in the nude.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sittingbourne Adult Education College - geograph.org.uk - 364022.jpg|thumb|left|The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College]]\n\nPlans for a boys' school in [[Borden, Kent|Borden]] began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer inhabitants of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]: [[Sheerness]] was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to [[Pengam]], South Wales, where the boys were to attend the [[Lewis School, Pengam|Lewis School]]. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, three updated war memorials were installed in the School vestibule, commemorating all those Old Bordenians known to have given their lives in the conflicts of the Twentieth Century (forty casualties in the First World War, sixty casualties in the Second World War, and single casualties in the Boer War, Korean War and Northern Ireland).\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThere is no uniform, students attend in the nude.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Sadie Sink]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations (and six wins), four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], set in 1983.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities.

Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

The series stars [[Will Arnett]] as the title character, BoJack Horseman. The supporting cast includes [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], and [[Aaron Paul]]. The series' first season premiered on August 22, 2014, on [[Netflix]], with a Christmas special premiering on December 19. The show is designed by the cartoonist [[Lisa Hanawalt]], who had previously worked with Bob-Waksberg on the [[webcomic]] ''Tip Me Over, Pour Me Out''.<ref>{{cite web|title=TMOPMO Merch |url=http://www.tmopmo.com/merch |accessdate=July 24, 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503171318/http://www.tmopmo.com/merch |archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n==Main characters==\n===BoJack Horseman===\n{{Main|BoJack Horseman (character)}}\n'''BoJack Horseman''' (voiced by [[Will Arnett]]; born January 2, 1964 in [[San Francisco, California]]) is a self-loathing, alcoholic, anthropomorphic [[horse]] currently in his 50s. His acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called ''Horsin' Around'' in the 1990s. He went on to star in ''The BoJack Horseman Show'', an edgier, less successful sitcom which was cancelled in 2007 after just one season. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded about {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him. Many of his issues stem from his drug abuse, alcohol abuse, horrible decisions he's made throughout his career, and issues with his unhappy parents during childhood, which the audience is shown through flashbacks. At the end of season 5, BoJack checks into rehab after he developed a drug addiction to prescription painkillers he was on which caused him to strangle his co-star. In season 6, he decides to fight his inner demons so he can stay sober and be content with himself, accepting a job as an acting professor at [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]]. His past inevitably catches up with him, however, when the ''Hollywoo Reporter'' runs a story about his role in Sarah Lynn's death, with eventually all the details of his many wrongdoings and missteps becoming common knowledge and BoJack inevitably being \"[[Call-out culture|canceled]].\" The isolation that ensues causes BoJack to briefly relapse into his old ways, breaking into his old home, using drugs and alcohol, and attempting suicide by drowning in his old swimming pool. His body is found the next morning and after initially being pronounced dead, he eventually comes to and is sentenced to prison for breaking and entering. In the series finale, he is released from prison for one day for Princess Carolyn's wedding, during which he takes the time to make amends with each of his old friends before eventually moving on and creating a new life for himself.\n\n===Princess Carolyn===\n{{Main|Princess Carolyn}}\n'''Princess Carolyn''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]; born June 6, 1974) is a pink [[Persian cat]] who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her dogged pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but frequently suffers miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina, who she subsequently names Ruthie in season 6. It is revealed in season 5 that she went to [[Los Angeles, California]] because she was accepted into [[UCLA]]. In season 6, she rehires her old assistant Judah to help her run VIM and is subsequently offered to run her own female-centered production company from Lenny Turteltaub called Girteltaub. As she prepares to make the transition, Judah confesses his love for her and a year later they are married. She ends the series in a good place and tells BoJack she wishes him well but also that they won't have any future professional relationship.\n\n===Diane Nguyen===\n{{Main|Diane Nguyen}}\n'''Diane Nguyen''' (voiced by [[Alison Brie]]) is a human [[ghostwriter]], a nice, well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a [[Vietnamese-American]] [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] from Boston who used to live with her rich and famous ex-boyfriend (and later ex-husband), former sitcom star Mr. Peanutbutter. She is hired by BoJack's publisher to ghostwrite his memoir, having written a biography of BoJack's childhood hero, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]]. While writing BoJack's memoir, he and Diane initially develop a strong friendship that becomes increasingly awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her. She has struggled throughout her career to get recognition for her writing, and travels to the war-torn Republic of Cordovia to make a difference, but discovers that this life is not for her. Ashamed of returning to Mr. Peanutbutter, she enters into a severe depression, during which she drinks heavily, smokes pot, and sleeps disheveled on BoJack's patio furniture. She is able to reconcile her feelings with Mr. Peanutbutter and gets a job at VIM ghostwriting tweets for celebrities. She is subsequently fired from VIM, and is hired to write for a feminist blog. During and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for [[Governor of California]] their marriage begins to deteriorate and, at the beginning of season 5, they divorce. Diane moves into a run-down studio apartment upon separating from Mr. Peanutbutter. In season 6 Diane starts a relationship with  her coworker, a Bison named Guy, and decides after returning to her studio apartment to move in with him in Chicago. She begins writing a new memoir that leads her back into her recurring depression. She combats this with antidepressants (which itself leads to a noticeable weight gain) but these stall her progress on her memoir, which she eventually abandons in favor of a teen fiction series called ''Ivy Tran: Food Court Detective''. She eventually moves to [[Houston]] with Guy and is revealed in the series finale to have married him. She ends the series having what will seemingly be her last conversation with BoJack, telling him that she is grateful that she knew BoJack and for her life in LA, but that she is ready to move on.\n\n===Mr. Peanutbutter===\n{{Main|Mr. Peanutbutter}}\n'''Mr. Peanutbutter''' (voiced by [[Paul F. Tompkins]]) is an energetic and cheerful yellow [[Labrador Retriever]] who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's ex-boyfriend (and later ex-husband). Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of ''Mr. Peanutbutter's House'', which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from ''Horsin' Around''. He portrays many characteristics of an actual Labrador yet portrayed as a human-like character being sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate. He had a stint at filming a celebrity reality show called ''Peanutbutter and Jelly''. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on ''Horsin' Around''. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures, such as a Halloween store that is exclusively open in January. In the episode \"Let's Find Out\", Mr. Peanutbutter starts hosting his own televised game show after his film company enters bankruptcy due to his and Todd's extensive expenditures on useless products. In \"[[Hank After Dark]]\", it is revealed that Mr. Peanutbutter was formerly married to a woman named Katrina who was emotionally abusive. His second wife was famous actress [[Jessica Biel]], who is portrayed as being obsessed with her celebrity status and people recognizing her. He grew up in the [[Labrador Peninsula]], which is depicted as being populated entirely by [[Labrador Retriever]]s. \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. He often shouts to an offscreen, but implicatively outlandish, presence only known as \"Erica\". He is a graduate of [[Northwestern University]]. After his divorce with Diane, he started dating a pug named Pickles who is much younger than him but shares a lot of the same characteristics. At the end of the season 5 finale, he proposes to her, though only out of guilt after cheating on her with Diane. He does eventually tell Pickles of his infidelity which leads to the joint decision that for them to be even she must sleep with other men and him be fine with the situation. He later becomes the face of depression on a tour around the US talking about the mental illness with pop star Joey Pogo. During this time, he encourages Pickles to sleep with Joey Pogo due to their similarities, however this eventually backfires when Pickles leaves Mr. Peanutbutter for Pogo.\n\n===Todd Chavez===\n{{Main|Todd Chavez}}\n'''Todd Chavez''' (voiced by [[Aaron Paul]]) (born 1990/91) is a friendly and lovable human [[slacker]] who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own [[rock opera]], ''Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia''. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with BoJack. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places ''[[The Prince and the Pauper|Prince and the Pauper]]''-style with a dictator from Cordovia, a fictional eastern European country in the midst of a brutal civil war. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \"It's You\" in season three, where he finally snaps at him for his constant misdoings; it is not until the season four episode \"Hooray! Todd Episode!\" where they finally speak again, with the now-humbled BoJack having a sincere talk with him. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack. His catch phrases include shouting \"hooray!\". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. In season 5, he gets a management position at a clock website company called \"What Time Is It Right Now\", but then he gets laid off at the end of season 5. In season 6 episode \"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\", he gives one of his kidneys to his mom who is in desperate need of one. He later begins a relationship with Maude, an asexual cashier at an airport [[Cinnabon|Cinnabunny]], and they quickly move in together, sharing an affinity for quirky, outlandish ideas. He also reconnects with his mother after several failed attempts catching her attention after staging a fake kidnapping by Character Actress [[Margo Martindale]]. At the end of the series, Todd reconnects with BoJack at Princess Carolyn's wedding, revealing that he has made up with his mother and enjoys a comfortable life with Maude and his daycare service which he runs in the VIM Management building. He encourages BoJack to keep up his sobriety and shares an insight about art that leads BoJack to say with affection \"Is that smart or stupid\" and Todd to gleefully say \"I never know!\"\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Pinky Penguin===\n'''Pinky Penguin''' (voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]]) is an [[Emperor penguin]] and book editor who works at [[Penguin Publishing]]. He was depending on BoJack's book to save his job and the entire company. In \"Yesterdayland\", Pinky started working at MBN. At the end of \"Later\", it is revealed he was able to see his kids again. After Wanda moves to Detroit, he becomes the head of MBN. His wife has stated that everything he touches falls apart, and much of his character's humor is derived from his failures or near-failures.\n\n===Sarah Lynn===\n'''Sarah Lynn''' (born '''Sarah Himmelfarb''', voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) was a human actress who played the Horse's precocious adoptive youngest daughter Sabrina on ''Horsin' Around'' starting when she was only three years old, and who looked up to BoJack off-screen as a father figure. After the show went off the air, she became a successful pop singer in the early 2000s before drug addiction and alcoholism ended her career. Flashbacks indicate that Sarah Lynn's self-destructive behavior is in part the result of being forced into an acting career by her mother, and BoJack (whom she idolized) having neglected her as a child. Around the end of \"Later\", she was seen visiting [[Andrew Garfield]] (with whom she was mentioned as having an on-again, off-again relationship) at the hospital. It is heavily implied that she was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend and later stepfather. Although BoJack attempts to get her sober earlier in season 1, he later goes on a bender with her and Todd in an attempt to rewrite his memoir after firing Diane.\n\nIn season 3, she becomes sober, but only because she hears that taking drugs after being sober for a long time is the best experience. When BoJack hits rock bottom, he invites Sarah Lynn to go on an epic bender. Through a series of blackouts, they have a series of misadventures attempting to make amends to BoJack's ex-friends, and even stalking Penny at [[Oberlin College]]. Along the way, Sarah Lynn wins the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in absentia. She then admits to BoJack that she doesn't like anything about herself and, at the [[Griffith Observatory]] planetarium, dies lying on BoJack's shoulder after a drug overdose. In \"That Went Well\", it is revealed that BoJack was at one point her only friend who hadn't tried to get something from her, and her downward spiral began after he visited her and tried to get her to be a guest star on his TV show. It is later revealed in \"A Little Uneven, Is All\" that the first time Sarah Lynn drank alcohol was from a bottle of vodka that BoJack left on set when she was ten years old. During season 6, BoJack has recurring flashbacks about her and is one of the reasons why he wants to get sober. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost accidentally committed suicide.\n\n===Herb Kazzaz===\n'''Herb Kazzaz''' (voiced by [[Stanley Tucci]]) was BoJack's human former comedy partner, who created and wrote ''Horsin' Around'' where he also provided the voice of Mr. Libertore who runs the law firm where the Horse works as an attorney. Herb appeared to be friendly and upbeat during the show's production, usually nice, understanding, and insightful to all his cast, even Bradley. When BoJack and Herb first meet as comedians, BoJack angrily tells him to \"get cancer\" which is what eventually happens. Halfway through production of ''Horsin' Around'', Herb is caught engaging in a public sexual act with another man which causes a public outcry for his removal from the show. BoJack and Herb had a falling out at the apex of the show's success when Herb was blackballed by the network for being gay and BoJack did not stand up for Herb for fear of losing his own job. At the beginning of the series, they have not spoken for nearly 20 years. BoJack attempts to reconnect with him after learning Herb has been diagnosed with terminal [[rectal cancer]] and is being watched over by Tina. Though Herb reveals he lived a full life in spite of losing ''Horsin' Around'', he has not forgiven BoJack for not having been a supportive friend and refuses to do so when BoJack finally apologizes to him. Despite his cancer going into remission, he instantly passes away due to an allergic reaction to the peanuts on a peanut truck in a car crash when his brakes gave out during a ride home from the hospital. It was also revealed that Herb's office was under the room where tap dancer [[Savion Glover]] kept a studio. Following his death, [[Henry Winkler]] (who Herb met volunteering at [[Habitat for Humanity]]) and Tina stole the manuscript of his poorly written novel to keep it from being published and tainting his legacy. In \"[[Out to Sea (BoJack Horseman)|Out to Sea]]\", Herb's ashes are donated to the Jerb Kazzaz Memorial Orphanage (misspelled due to BoJack's email and the hedgehog owner's stubborn refusal to pay for its replacement). He makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide.\n\n===Hollyhock===\n'''Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack''' (voiced by [[Aparna Nancherla]]) is a 17-year-old [[filly]] first seen at the end of \"That Went Well\". She was adopted by eight fathers in a committed gay [[polyamorous]] relationship. She is at first believed to be BoJack's illegitimate daughter. During season four, she moves in with BoJack to find out more about him and later visits Beatrice, BoJack's mother, who also moves in with them. It is later revealed that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of Butterscotch Horseman, BoJack's father, and Beatrice's maid, Henrietta, making her BoJack's half-sister. Beatrice, who snipes at Hollyhock for being overweight, spikes her coffee with weight-loss supplements (containing amphetamines). She overdoses and is rushed to the hospital and survives, although she suffers from PTSD like symptoms when she returns to BoJack's house. In season 5, she is a freshman at [[Wesleyan University]]. In the season 6 mid-season cliff hanger, \"A Quick One While He's Away\", she goes to a party in NYC and meets Pete-Repeat, who was on a double date with BoJack and Penny at the high-school prom \"Escape from LA\". Hollyhock ends up discovering BoJack giving Pete's girlfriend at the time, Maddy, alcohol poisoning, when they're talking. When BoJack takes a teaching position at Wesleyan, Hollyhock is distant from him due to learning about that past misdeed and makes it clear she doesn't appreciate him imposing himself on her college experience, stating that he shouldn't say she's his sister \"like it means something\" and only reluctantly giving him any reason to think they'll have an improved relationship going forward. When the full weight of BoJack's misdeeds becomes public, Hollyhock ignores BoJack's desperate phone messages, disconnects her phone, and sends him a letter which is unseen but his heartbroken reaction to it implies she will no longer have any contact or relationship with him.\n\n===Butterscotch Horseman===\n'''Butterscotch Horseman''' (voiced by Will Arnett) was a horse who was BoJack's physically and verbally abusive father. He appears in flashbacks to BoJack's childhood. Butterscotch, who hailed from a working-class background, was an alcoholic and failed novelist. He resented his wife's financial independence and took out his insecurities on BoJack. In flashbacks, Butterscotch is often seen yelling nonsensical conservative hyperbole such as claiming that the [[Panama Canal]] is for \"Democrats\" and calls screws \"fancy Jew nails.\" He is confirmed to be dead, as a flashback shows BoJack and Beatrice going to Butterscotch's funeral. In \"[[Time's Arrow (BoJack Horseman)|Time's Arrow]]\", it is revealed that Butterscotch is Hollyhock's father, due to his affair with the family maid named Henrietta. In \"Free Churro\", BoJack revealed that Butterscotch died after challenging a man who hated his book to a duel and then tripping and hitting his head on a rock. \n\nA version of Butterscotch appears in the penultimate episode \"The View From Halfway Down\" as one of many deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees in a prolonged hallucination while he is unconscious following a suicide attempt. While most of the other figures in the hallucination appear as they did in life, Butterscotch is portrayed as a hybrid with Secretariat, with Secretariat's appearance and Butterscotch's voice, and his personality/experiences being presented as a combination of the two. During the hallucination, the half of the horse that's based on Butterscotch tells BoJack that he always cared about and loved him, but was terrified of letting that show. In the cabaret, he performs a reading of the eponymous poem \"The View From Halfway Down,\" drawing from Butterscotch's penchant for literature and poetry while being largely based on Secretariat's suicide.\n\n===Beatrice Horseman===\n'''Beatrice Elizabeth Horseman''' (n\u00e9e Sugarman) (voiced by [[Wendie Malick]]) was a horse who was BoJack's neglectful, verbally abusive mother. Heiress to the Sugarman [[sugar cube]] fortune, she primarily appears in flashbacks of BoJack's childhood and young adult life. In \"[[Brand New Couch]]\", Beatrice calls up BoJack to tell him she read the book about him and concedes that he was born \"broken\". In \"The Old Sugarman Place\", it is revealed that Beatrice's family had a summer home in [[Michigan]] when she was a child, and that she had an older brother named Crackerjack, who died in World War II. Her childhood was marked by cruel treatment from family and peers alike, hardening and embittering her personality. While seen as a liberal college graduate concerned with the [[civil rights movement]], she soon becomes bitter and jaded after making the poor choice to romantically involve herself with Butterscotch Horseman. After becoming impregnated by Butterscotch, Beatrice decides to marry him and move to [[San Francisco, California]], where she becomes resentful of BoJack, blaming him for her dissatisfaction in her life. She begins to suffer from [[dementia]] and after an incident at her nursing home, she moves in with BoJack and Hollyhock. However, after BoJack realizes Beatrice has been drugging Hollyhock (to make her lose weight), BoJack kicks her out of his house to put her into an even worse nursing home and makes clear he no longer wants her in his life. In the episode \"[[Free Churro]]\", it is revealed that Beatrice has died at the age of 80 years old, as BoJack is delivering a eulogy to her throughout the episode. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide.\n\n===Crackerjack Sugarman===\n'''Crackerjack Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]) \u2013 Beatrice Horseman's older brother, BoJack's uncle, and the eldest son of Joseph and Honey Sugarman, who died in World War II when Beatrice was very young. He later appears at the end of the series as one of the many deceased people BoJack sees in his hallucination with whom he ecstatically meets while in his hallucination following his near-death experience. During the theatrical show scene in BoJack's hallucination, he plays the trumpet for Beatrice while she does an acrobatic routine.\n\n===Joseph Sugarman===\n'''Joseph Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Matthew Broderick]]) was Beatrice's father and BoJack's maternal grandfather, the owner of the Sugarman Sugar corporation. Emotionally distant, he frequently spouted his backward views about women, making Beatrice feel insecure and inadequate (for which she compensates with meanness as an adult).\n\n===Honey Sugarman===\n'''Honey Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Jane Krakowski]]) was Beatrice's mother and BoJack's maternal grandmother. She was a housewife and exceptional singer, but suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after her son, Crackerjack Sugarman (voiced by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]) was killed in World War II. After she got drunk and made a scene while out with young Beatrice and forced her to drive home, and the resultant car accident, her husband had her [[lobotomy|lobotomized]].\n\n===Charlotte Carson===\n'''Charlotte Carson''' (n\u00e9e Moore) (voiced by [[Olivia Wilde]]) is a [[deer]] who was Herb Kazzaz's old girlfriend with whom BoJack was once in love. During a drug and alcohol induced stupor in \"Downer Ending\", BoJack imagines an alternate life where instead of becoming a television star he moves to Maine with Charlotte. In this fantasy, the couple get married, have a daughter named Harper, and lead a quiet rustic lifestyle.\n\nIn \"Still Broken\", Charlotte attended Herb Kazzaz's funeral. In a discussion with BoJack, she mentioned that she visited Herb and read the part in BoJack's book on how he and Herb fought over a telescope. She tells him she only lived in Maine for a month and later moved to [[Tesuque, New Mexico]]. In \"Escape from LA\", BoJack drives to Charlotte's house to find she is married to a dorky bro named Kyle and has two teenage children named Trip (human) and Penny (doe). She also owns a store called \"Your Deer Friend\". During his time in New Mexico, BoJack bonds with the 17-year-old Penny by becoming her \"date\" for prom. While talking with Charlotte later over by her fire pit, the two share a brief kiss. BoJack initially urges her to leave with him anew amidst her protests, eventually relenting. However, Charlotte asks him to leave by the next day, confessing his presence depresses her. Later that night, Charlotte catches BoJack and Penny in a compromising position in his yacht. BoJack apologizes, but she orders him to get off her property before she calls the police, and warns BoJack that if he contacts her or her family again, she will kill him. She returns briefly in the final season, when she and Penny are approached by Paige Sinclair who seeks details of their encounter with BoJack for an article she is writing about his involvement in Sarah Lynn's death. She tells BoJack she doesn't want to be involved and that he has to handle the situation, causing him to hyperventilate and later pass out.\n\n===Penny Carson===\n'''Penny Carson''' (voiced by [[Ilana Glazer]]) \u2013 A deer who is Charlotte and Kyle's daughter, and Trip's sister. She bonds with BoJack while he stays at their home during \"Escape from L.A.\" where he acts as her surrogate date from prom. After returning from the home, she propositions him to have sex which BoJack rejects despite her saying she is of consent age in her state. Charlotte later finds her and BoJack in a compromising position on his yacht and she is sent to her room before either one can explain what happened. In season three, BoJack attempted to reconcile with Penny believing she may have been emotionally damaged because of the incident and finds her at her school [[Oberlin College]]. Penny freaked out when he suddenly appeared and ran off stating that he shouldn't be here. She appears again in season 6 when Paige and Maximilian ask for details about her encounter with BoJack. She considers if it is time to finally come forward, with Charlotte telling her that if she does, she must do it on her own terms.\n\n===Lenny Turteltaub===\n'''Lenny Turteltaub''' (voiced by [[J. K. Simmons|J.K. Simmons]]) is a tortoise and big-shot film producer in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}. He worked with [[Ed Begley|Ed Begley, Sr.]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] during their youth, suggesting that he is extremely old (a reference to the lifespan of actual turtles). He is shown to dislike BoJack but continuously casts him in projects for financial gain. His name is a play off Hollywood producer and director [[Jon Turteltaub]].\n\n===Paparazzi Birds===\nThe '''Paparazzi Birds''' (voiced by [[Adam Conover]] and Dave Segal) are an unnamed [[blue jay]] and [[European robin]] duo who try to get incriminating pictures of BoJack, Diane, and other celebrities. They attempt to blackmail BoJack after taking photos of him having intercourse with Sarah Lynn but are stopped by Vanessa Gekko under threat of a lawsuit for trespassing, paparazziing without a permit and blackmail before threatening to frame them for [[Tupac Shakur| Tupac]]'s murder.\n\n===Tina===\n'''Tina''' is a [[brown bear]] who is the nurse of Herb Kazzaz. In \"Still Broken\", Tina was in collaboration with Henry Winkler to keep Herb's terrible manuscript for a novel from being posthumously published and harming his legacy. Unlike the other anthropomorphic characters on the show, Tina only speaks in growls. Later in season 4, Tina returns as the nurse of BoJack's Mother, Beatrice.\n\n===Sextina Aquafina===\nSextina Aquafina (voiced by [[Aisha Tyler]] in season 1\u20132, [[Daniele Gaither]] in season 3) is a [[bottlenose dolphin]] pop-music sensation. In \"Out to Sea\", Diane meets with Sextina to discuss becoming her social-media ghostwriter. In the season three episode \"Brrap Brrap Pew Pew\", Diane accidentally tweeted out that Sextina was having an abortion while she was being distracted, which caused a media storm. While Sextina was initially angered with the tweet and tried to fire Diane, she later embraced the image because of support from other celebrities. She later released a music video militantly supporting abortion, had her \"abortion\" on live TV, and soon after became pregnant. It is implied that she is sent to a farm where celebrities go to disappear.\n\nAccording to creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, she is based on a girl who was in his and Lisa Hanawalt's English class as a senior in high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/a-gif-of-a-cat-falling-asleep#.cjAx6E0Ln|title=How A Show About A Depressed Horse Became Incredibly Human|first=Ariane|last=Lange|work=BuzzFeed|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Kelsey Jannings===\n'''Kelsey Jannings''' (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]) is a human who was hired to direct the ''Secretariat'' movie. A divorced, lesbian, independent filmmaker, she sees the ''Secretariat'' project as her last chance to break into the big time and make enough money to get her daughter Irving into an Ivy League school (as opposed to [[Vassar College|Vassar]]). Cynical and initially dismissive of BoJack's attitude, she and BoJack grow closer over the course of filming. She has a special fondness for Todd because she likes his face. She is later fired by Lenny Turteltaub in \"The Shot\" for filming a scene that involved Secretariat's encounter with [[Richard Nixon]] which had since been cut from the film.\n\nIn season three, BoJack finds Kelsey at POFF (Pacific Ocean Film Festival) and attempts to reconcile with her through various apology notes, however she cannot understand it because the ink starts to wash away and BoJack is unaware of his suit's voice capabilities until the episode ends. Later in the season, the two discuss doing a serious independent film together called ''Jelly Belle'' to legitimize BoJack as an actor. Unfortunately, this is part of a plan by Vanessa Gekko to sabotage Princess Carolyn's agency, and the film option expires before a deal can be reached. The resulting fallout seemingly ends BoJack's unique professional and artistic connection with Kelsey.\n\nIn season six, Kelsey is struggling to find directing jobs, due in part to her getting fired from the Secretariat film. After giving an impassioned speech about the hurdles she's had to face due to sexism in the film industry, she gets the job directing the female superhero film ''Fireflame''.\n\n===A Ryan Seacrest Type===\n'''A [[Ryan Seacrest]] Type''' (voiced by [[Adam Conover]]) is the name of a human character who hosts \"Excess Hollywood\" (later renamed \"Excess {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" after BoJack steals the D in the [[Hollywood Sign]] and the D is accidentally destroyed in a helicopter crash) and interviews celebrities. He also hosts \"Morning Time, {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" with a female human called Some Lady, and briefly with another co-host named An Actress or Something who is filling in for Some Lady after her apparent kidnapping. In the third season, he is run over by BoJack driving a limo. He is later revealed to have somehow survived and hosts a late night talk show as well as co-hosting Excess {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} with \"A [[Billy Bush]] Type\" (voiced by Kevin Bigley). He briefly co-anchors the ski race between Mr. Peanutbutter and Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz with Tom Jumbo-Grumbo, but quits after being sensitive to the cold weather. In season 5, it is revealed that he also hosts a radio show called The Deep Dive.\n\n===Tom Jumbo-Grumbo===\n'''Tom Jumbo-Grumbo''' (voiced by [[Keith Olbermann]]) is a [[blue whale]] who is a [[News presenter|newsman]] and pundit on MSNBSea (a parody of [[MSNBC]]). Tom often reports on BoJack's misdeeds and other happenings in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}, often through alliteration. Whenever something goes wrong on the air, he blames it all on an off-screen presence only known as \"Randy\", and makes various jokes at the expense of his squid ex-wife Shannon, though he usually immediately apologizes afterwards.\n\n===Wayne===\n'''Wayne''' (voiced by [[Wyatt Cenac]]) is Diane's human ex-boyfriend who is a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] and a [[BuzzFeed]] writer. He conspires with Diane to leak a small portion of BoJack's book to create hype and convince BoJack to allow its publication. They once worked together at [[Starbucks]] before Diane became a published author.\n\n===Vanessa Gekko===\n'''Vanessa Gekko''' (voiced by [[Kristin Chenoweth]]) \u2013 A human {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} talent agent and the rival of Princess Carolyn. She is a seemingly better agent than Princess Carolyn because she has a husband and kids, thereby \"having it all.\" She temporarily shares an office with Princess Carolyn when their agencies merge. Sometime between seasons 2 and 3, she and Rutabaga started their own agency, Gekko-Rabbitowitz, which ultimately sabotages VIM, leading to the latter agency's collapse.\n\n===Charley Witherspoon===\n'''Charley Witherspoon''' (voiced by [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]]) is a [[tree frog]] who is the son of Mr. Witherspoon. He works at the Vigor agency where his hand keeps sticking to things. Charley was briefly Princess Carolyn's assistant, but was later made an agent.\n\nAfter his father's death, he is sworn in as the new President of Vigor. He is shown to be a poor leader, choosing to hire the Utah Jazz as agents rather than basketball players.

In all of the cases below, the celebrities have voiced themselves:\n\n* {{Anchor|Neil deGrasse Tyson}}'''[[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]''' \u2013 Narrated the light show at the planetarium in S3 E11 \"That's too much, man!\"\n\n* {{Anchor|Character Actress Margo Martindale}} '''[[Margo Martindale|\"Character Actress\" Margo Martindale]]''' \u2013 An exaggerated, criminally insane version of actress Margo Martindale who willingly goes along with BoJack's schemes no matter how convoluted or dangerous. She is always referred to by other characters as \"Character Actress Margo Martindale\", rather than simply by her name. In season 1, she is arrested helping BoJack fake a bank robbery in order to steal Diane's engagement ring, and is incarcerated in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} Hills Super-Max Prison. In \"Later\", Margo was seen in the prison's cafeteria talking to her fellow inmates that resemble the characters from ''[[Orange is the New Black]]''. In season 2's \"The Shot\", the audience sees Margo get released early from prison due to good behavior. Later in the same episode, Margo gets involved in a shootout with the [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] police in order to distract them from BoJack's unauthorized use of the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library]] for his movie ''Secretariat''. When the police recognize her face but do not recall her name, she opens fire on them in the name of often-unrecognized fellow character actors like [[John Carroll Lynch]] and [[C. C. H. Pounder|C.C.H. Pounder]]. In season 3, it is revealed in flashbacks that she was BoJack's co-star on ''The BoJack Horseman Show''. In \"[[Stop the Presses (BoJack Horseman)|Stop the Presses]]\", it is revealed that she's been hiding out on BoJack's boat since the previous season's shootout in Yorba Linda, during which time she starred in a regional production of a [[Tennessee Williams]] play while also doing a character arc as Ruth Eastman on ''[[The Good Wife]]''. She eventually steals BoJack's boat and a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 version of Todd's head and flees into international waters. During the season 3 finale, \"That Went Well\", she's shown to have become delusional after weeks alone in the open sea, believing that the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Todd-head is called \"Skippy\" and that it speaks to her. In her delusions, she causes an accident with the ''Cargot Cartinadale'', a cargo ship carrying tons of pasta, resulting in an environmental disaster which Mr. Peanutbutter ends up resolving. In an MSNBSea newscrawl in season 4, it is revealed that she is still lost at sea and presumed dead. In season 5, it is revealed she was found alive by a remote convent with amnesia, with them unaware of her identity. However, when she sees a giant floating balloon of BoJack, she begins screaming his name. In season 6, Margo regains her memory and becomes a nun, but leaves the convent in a priest's Alfa Romeo. She later returns for one last scheme, pretending to kidnap Todd and Maude so that Todd can reconnect with his estranged mother. She does this to make amends for having helped ruin Todd's rock opera, and later claims that all of her escapades throughout the whole series were one long ruse to help Todd and his mother reunite.\n* '''[[Naomi Watts]]''' \u2013 An exaggerated version of the actress, she plays Diane in Mr. Peanutbutter's film. While in character as Diane, she engages in a fast-paced sexual relationship with BoJack only to lose interest in him when her character is ultimately written out of the movie and replaced with a ball on a stick. Naomi advises she is tired of playing well-rounded female characters, and only initially takes the Mr. Peanutbutter film due to its one-dimensional portrayal of Diane.\n* '''[[Wallace Shawn]]''' \u2013 An exaggerated version of the real life actor; plays BoJack in Mr. Peanutbutter's film.\n* '''[[Henry Winkler]]''' \u2013 Best known for his guest spot on ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'', he gives the eulogy at Herb Kazzaz's funeral.

Whilst underground, she forms a cult dedicated to worshipping fire and burns Zach Braff alive in ritual sacrifice. She intends to burn Peanutbutter afterwards, but is accidentally stopped by BoJack and Diane. She later teams up with Peanutbutter's other ex-wife, Katrina, and runs for governor so she can get back at Mr. Peanutbutter.

His acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called ''Horsin' Around'' in the 1990s. He went on to star in ''The BoJack Horseman Show'', an edgier, less successful sitcom which was cancelled in 2007 after just one season. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded about {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him. Many of his issues stem from his drug abuse, alcohol abuse, horrible decisions he's made throughout his career, and issues with his unhappy parents during childhood, which the audience is shown through flashbacks. At the end of season 5, BoJack checks into rehab after he developed a drug addiction to prescription painkillers he was on which caused him to strangle his co-star. In season 6, he decides to fight his inner demons so he can stay sober and be content with himself, accepting a job as an acting professor at [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]]. His past inevitably catches up with him, however, when the ''Hollywoo Reporter'' runs a story about his role in Sarah Lynn's death, with eventually all the details of his many wrongdoings and missteps becoming common knowledge and BoJack inevitably being \"[[Call-out culture|canceled]].\" The isolation that ensues causes BoJack to briefly relapse into his old ways, breaking into his old home, using drugs and alcohol, and attempting suicide by drowning in his old swimming pool. His body is found the next morning and after initially being pronounced dead, he eventually comes to and is sentenced to prison for breaking and entering. In the series finale, he is released from prison for one day for Princess Carolyn's wedding, during which he takes the time to make amends with each of his old friends before eventually moving on and creating a new life for himself.\n\n===Princess Carolyn===\n{{Main|Princess Carolyn}}\n'''Princess Carolyn''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]) is a pink [[Persian cat]] who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her dogged pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but frequently suffers miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina, who she subsequently names Ruthie in season 6. It is revealed in season 5 that she went to [[Los Angeles, California]] because she was accepted into [[UCLA]]. In season 6, she rehires her old assistant Judah to help her run VIM and is subsequently offered to run her own female-centered production company from Lenny Turteltaub called Girteltaub. As she prepares to make the transition, Judah confesses his love for her and a year later they are married. She ends the series in a good place and tells BoJack she wishes him well but also that they won't have any future professional relationship.\n\n===Diane Nguyen===\n{{Main|Diane Nguyen}}\n'''Diane Nguyen''' (voiced by [[Alison Brie]]) is a human [[ghostwriter]], a nice, well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a [[Vietnamese-American]] [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] from Boston who used to live with her rich and famous ex-boyfriend (and later ex-husband), former sitcom star Mr. Peanutbutter. She is hired by BoJack's publisher to ghostwrite his memoir, having written a biography of BoJack's childhood hero, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]]. While writing BoJack's memoir, he and Diane initially develop a strong friendship that becomes increasingly awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her. She has struggled throughout her career to get recognition for her writing, and travels to the war-torn Republic of Cordovia to make a difference, but discovers that this life is not for her. Ashamed of returning to Mr. Peanutbutter, she enters into a severe depression, during which she drinks heavily, smokes pot, and sleeps disheveled on BoJack's patio furniture. She is able to reconcile her feelings with Mr. Peanutbutter and gets a job at VIM ghostwriting tweets for celebrities. She is subsequently fired from VIM, and is hired to write for a feminist blog. During and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for [[Governor of California]] their marriage begins to deteriorate and, at the beginning of season 5, they divorce. Diane moves into a run-down studio apartment upon separating from Mr. Peanutbutter. In season 6 Diane starts a relationship with  her coworker, a Bison named Guy, and decides after returning to her studio apartment to move in with him in Chicago. She begins writing a new memoir that leads her back into her recurring depression. She combats this with antidepressants (which itself leads to a noticeable weight gain) but these stall her progress on her memoir, which she eventually abandons in favor of a teen fiction series called ''Ivy Tran: Food Court Detective''. She eventually moves to [[Houston]] with Guy and is revealed in the series finale to have married him. She ends the series having what will seemingly be her last conversation with BoJack, telling him that she is grateful that she knew BoJack and for her life in LA, but that she is ready to move on.\n\n===Mr. Peanutbutter===\n{{Main|Mr. Peanutbutter}}\n'''Mr. Peanutbutter''' (voiced by [[Paul F. Tompkins]]) is an energetic and cheerful yellow [[Labrador Retriever]] who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's ex-boyfriend (and later ex-husband). Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of ''Mr. Peanutbutter's House'', which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from ''Horsin' Around''. He portrays many characteristics of an actual Labrador yet portrayed as a human-like character being sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate. He had a stint at filming a celebrity reality show called ''Peanutbutter and Jelly''. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on ''Horsin' Around''. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures, such as a Halloween store that is exclusively open in January. In the episode \"Let's Find Out\", Mr. Peanutbutter starts hosting his own televised game show after his film company enters bankruptcy due to his and Todd's extensive expenditures on useless products. In \"[[Hank After Dark]]\", it is revealed that Mr. Peanutbutter was formerly married to a woman named Katrina who was emotionally abusive. His second wife was famous actress [[Jessica Biel]], who is portrayed as being obsessed with her celebrity status and people recognizing her. He grew up in the [[Labrador Peninsula]], which is depicted as being populated entirely by [[Labrador Retriever]]s. \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. He often shouts to an offscreen, but implicatively outlandish, presence only known as \"Erica\". He is a graduate of [[Northwestern University]]. After his divorce with Diane, he started dating a pug named Pickles who is much younger than him but shares a lot of the same characteristics. At the end of the season 5 finale, he proposes to her, though only out of guilt after cheating on her with Diane. He does eventually tell Pickles of his infidelity which leads to the joint decision that for them to be even she must sleep with other men and him be fine with the situation. He later becomes the face of depression on a tour around the US talking about the mental illness with pop star Joey Pogo. During this time, he encourages Pickles to sleep with Joey Pogo due to their similarities, however this eventually backfires when Pickles leaves Mr. Peanutbutter for Pogo.\n\n===Todd Chavez===\n{{Main|Todd Chavez}}\n'''Todd Chavez''' (voiced by [[Aaron Paul]]) (born 1990/91) is a friendly and lovable human [[slacker]] who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own [[rock opera]], ''Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia''. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with BoJack. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places ''[[The Prince and the Pauper|Prince and the Pauper]]''-style with a dictator from Cordovia, a fictional eastern European country in the midst of a brutal civil war. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \"It's You\" in season three, where he finally snaps at him for his constant misdoings; it is not until the season four episode \"Hooray! Todd Episode!\" where they finally speak again, with the now-humbled BoJack having a sincere talk with him. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack. His catch phrases include shouting \"hooray!\". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. In season 5, he gets a management position at a clock website company called \"What Time Is It Right Now\", but then he gets laid off at the end of season 5. In season 6 episode \"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\", he gives one of his kidneys to his mom who is in desperate need of one. He later begins a relationship with Maude, an asexual cashier at an airport [[Cinnabon|Cinnabunny]], and they quickly move in together, sharing an affinity for quirky, outlandish ideas. He also reconnects with his mother after several failed attempts catching her attention after staging a fake kidnapping by Character Actress [[Margo Martindale]]. At the end of the series, Todd reconnects with BoJack at Princess Carolyn's wedding, revealing that he has made up with his mother and enjoys a comfortable life with Maude and his daycare service which he runs in the VIM Management building. He encourages BoJack to keep up his sobriety and shares an insight about art that leads BoJack to say with affection \"Is that smart or stupid\" and Todd to gleefully say \"I never know!\"\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Pinky Penguin===\n'''Pinky Penguin''' (voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]]) is an [[Emperor penguin]] and book editor who works at [[Penguin Publishing]]. He was depending on BoJack's book to save his job and the entire company. In \"Yesterdayland\", Pinky started working at MBN. At the end of \"Later\", it is revealed he was able to see his kids again. After Wanda moves to Detroit, he becomes the head of MBN. His wife has stated that everything he touches falls apart, and much of his character's humor is derived from his failures or near-failures.\n\n===Sarah Lynn===\n'''Sarah Lynn''' (born '''Sarah Himmelfarb''', voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) was a human actress who played the Horse's precocious adoptive youngest daughter Sabrina on ''Horsin' Around'' starting when she was only three years old, and who looked up to BoJack off-screen as a father figure. After the show went off the air, she became a successful pop singer in the early 2000s before drug addiction and alcoholism ended her career. Flashbacks indicate that Sarah Lynn's self-destructive behavior is in part the result of being forced into an acting career by her mother, and BoJack (whom she idolized) having neglected her as a child. Around the end of \"Later\", she was seen visiting [[Andrew Garfield]] (with whom she was mentioned as having an on-again, off-again relationship) at the hospital. It is heavily implied that she was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend and later stepfather. Although BoJack attempts to get her sober earlier in season 1, he later goes on a bender with her and Todd in an attempt to rewrite his memoir after firing Diane.\n\nIn season 3, she becomes sober, but only because she hears that taking drugs after being sober for a long time is the best experience. When BoJack hits rock bottom, he invites Sarah Lynn to go on an epic bender. Through a series of blackouts, they have a series of misadventures attempting to make amends to BoJack's ex-friends, and even stalking Penny at [[Oberlin College]]. Along the way, Sarah Lynn wins the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in absentia. She then admits to BoJack that she doesn't like anything about herself and, at the [[Griffith Observatory]] planetarium, dies lying on BoJack's shoulder after a drug overdose. In \"That Went Well\", it is revealed that BoJack was at one point her only friend who hadn't tried to get something from her, and her downward spiral began after he visited her and tried to get her to be a guest star on his TV show. It is later revealed in \"A Little Uneven, Is All\" that the first time Sarah Lynn drank alcohol was from a bottle of vodka that BoJack left on set when she was ten years old. During season 6, BoJack has recurring flashbacks about her and is one of the reasons why he wants to get sober. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost accidentally committed suicide.\n\n===Herb Kazzaz===\n'''Herb Kazzaz''' (voiced by [[Stanley Tucci]]) was BoJack's human former comedy partner, who created and wrote ''Horsin' Around'' where he also provided the voice of Mr. Libertore who runs the law firm where the Horse works as an attorney. Herb appeared to be friendly and upbeat during the show's production, usually nice, understanding, and insightful to all his cast, even Bradley. When BoJack and Herb first meet as comedians, BoJack angrily tells him to \"get cancer\" which is what eventually happens. Halfway through production of ''Horsin' Around'', Herb is caught engaging in a public sexual act with another man which causes a public outcry for his removal from the show. BoJack and Herb had a falling out at the apex of the show's success when Herb was blackballed by the network for being gay and BoJack did not stand up for Herb for fear of losing his own job. At the beginning of the series, they have not spoken for nearly 20 years. BoJack attempts to reconnect with him after learning Herb has been diagnosed with terminal [[rectal cancer]] and is being watched over by Tina. Though Herb reveals he lived a full life in spite of losing ''Horsin' Around'', he has not forgiven BoJack for not having been a supportive friend and refuses to do so when BoJack finally apologizes to him. Despite his cancer going into remission, he instantly passes away due to an allergic reaction to the peanuts on a peanut truck in a car crash when his brakes gave out during a ride home from the hospital. It was also revealed that Herb's office was under the room where tap dancer [[Savion Glover]] kept a studio. Following his death, [[Henry Winkler]] (who Herb met volunteering at [[Habitat for Humanity]]) and Tina stole the manuscript of his poorly written novel to keep it from being published and tainting his legacy. In \"[[Out to Sea (BoJack Horseman)|Out to Sea]]\", Herb's ashes are donated to the Jerb Kazzaz Memorial Orphanage (misspelled due to BoJack's email and the hedgehog owner's stubborn refusal to pay for its replacement). He makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide.\n\n===Hollyhock===\n'''Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack''' (voiced by [[Aparna Nancherla]]) is a 17-year-old [[filly]] first seen at the end of \"That Went Well\". She was adopted by eight fathers in a committed gay [[polyamorous]] relationship. She is at first believed to be BoJack's illegitimate daughter. During season four, she moves in with BoJack to find out more about him and later visits Beatrice, BoJack's mother, who also moves in with them. It is later revealed that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of Butterscotch Horseman, BoJack's father, and Beatrice's maid, Henrietta, making her BoJack's half-sister. Beatrice, who snipes at Hollyhock for being overweight, spikes her coffee with weight-loss supplements (containing amphetamines). She overdoses and is rushed to the hospital and survives, although she suffers from PTSD like symptoms when she returns to BoJack's house. In season 5, she is a freshman at [[Wesleyan University]]. In the season 6 mid-season cliff hanger, \"A Quick One While He's Away\", she goes to a party in NYC and meets Pete-Repeat, who was on a double date with BoJack and Penny at the high-school prom \"Escape from LA\". Hollyhock ends up discovering BoJack giving Pete's girlfriend at the time, Maddy, alcohol poisoning, when they're talking. When BoJack takes a teaching position at Wesleyan, Hollyhock is distant from him due to learning about that past misdeed and makes it clear she doesn't appreciate him imposing himself on her college experience, stating that he shouldn't say she's his sister \"like it means something\" and only reluctantly giving him any reason to think they'll have an improved relationship going forward. When the full weight of BoJack's misdeeds becomes public, Hollyhock ignores BoJack's desperate phone messages, disconnects her phone, and sends him a letter which is unseen but his heartbroken reaction to it implies she will no longer have any contact or relationship with him.\n\n===Butterscotch Horseman===\n'''Butterscotch Horseman''' (voiced by Will Arnett) was a horse who was BoJack's physically and verbally abusive father. He appears in flashbacks to BoJack's childhood. Butterscotch, who hailed from a working-class background, was an alcoholic and failed novelist. He resented his wife's financial independence and took out his insecurities on BoJack. In flashbacks, Butterscotch is often seen yelling nonsensical conservative hyperbole such as claiming that the [[Panama Canal]] is for \"Democrats\" and calls screws \"fancy Jew nails.\" He is confirmed to be dead, as a flashback shows BoJack and Beatrice going to Butterscotch's funeral. In \"[[Time's Arrow (BoJack Horseman)|Time's Arrow]]\", it is revealed that Butterscotch is Hollyhock's father, due to his affair with the family maid named Henrietta. In \"Free Churro\", BoJack revealed that Butterscotch died after challenging a man who hated his book to a duel and then tripping and hitting his head on a rock. \n\nA version of Butterscotch appears in the penultimate episode \"The View From Halfway Down\" as one of many deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees in a prolonged hallucination while he is unconscious following a suicide attempt. While most of the other figures in the hallucination appear as they did in life, Butterscotch is portrayed as a hybrid with Secretariat, with Secretariat's appearance and Butterscotch's voice, and his personality/experiences being presented as a combination of the two. During the hallucination, the half of the horse that's based on Butterscotch tells BoJack that he always cared about and loved him, but was terrified of letting that show. In the cabaret, he performs a reading of the eponymous poem \"The View From Halfway Down,\" drawing from Butterscotch's penchant for literature and poetry while being largely based on Secretariat's suicide.\n\n===Beatrice Horseman===\n'''Beatrice Elizabeth Horseman''' (n\u00e9e Sugarman) (voiced by [[Wendie Malick]]) was a horse who was BoJack's neglectful, verbally abusive mother. Heiress to the Sugarman [[sugar cube]] fortune, she primarily appears in flashbacks of BoJack's childhood and young adult life. In \"[[Brand New Couch]]\", Beatrice calls up BoJack to tell him she read the book about him and concedes that he was born \"broken\". In \"The Old Sugarman Place\", it is revealed that Beatrice's family had a summer home in [[Michigan]] when she was a child, and that she had an older brother named Crackerjack, who died in World War II. Her childhood was marked by cruel treatment from family and peers alike, hardening and embittering her personality. While seen as a liberal college graduate concerned with the [[civil rights movement]], she soon becomes bitter and jaded after making the poor choice to romantically involve herself with Butterscotch Horseman. After becoming impregnated by Butterscotch, Beatrice decides to marry him and move to [[San Francisco, California]], where she becomes resentful of BoJack, blaming him for her dissatisfaction in her life. She begins to suffer from [[dementia]] and after an incident at her nursing home, she moves in with BoJack and Hollyhock. However, after BoJack realizes Beatrice has been drugging Hollyhock (to make her lose weight), BoJack kicks her out of his house to put her into an even worse nursing home and makes clear he no longer wants her in his life. In the episode \"[[Free Churro]]\", it is revealed that Beatrice has died at the age of 80 years old, as BoJack is delivering a eulogy to her throughout the episode. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \"The View from Halfway Down\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide.\n\n===Crackerjack Sugarman===\n'''Crackerjack Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]) \u2013 Beatrice Horseman's older brother, BoJack's uncle, and the eldest son of Joseph and Honey Sugarman, who died in World War II when Beatrice was very young. He later appears at the end of the series as one of the many deceased people BoJack sees in his hallucination with whom he ecstatically meets while in his hallucination following his near-death experience. During the theatrical show scene in BoJack's hallucination, he plays the trumpet for Beatrice while she does an acrobatic routine.\n\n===Joseph Sugarman===\n'''Joseph Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Matthew Broderick]]) was Beatrice's father and BoJack's maternal grandfather, the owner of the Sugarman Sugar corporation. Emotionally distant, he frequently spouted his backward views about women, making Beatrice feel insecure and inadequate (for which she compensates with meanness as an adult).\n\n===Honey Sugarman===\n'''Honey Sugarman''' (voiced by [[Jane Krakowski]]) was Beatrice's mother and BoJack's maternal grandmother. She was a housewife and exceptional singer, but suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after her son, Crackerjack Sugarman (voiced by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]) was killed in World War II. After she got drunk and made a scene while out with young Beatrice and forced her to drive home, and the resultant car accident, her husband had her [[lobotomy|lobotomized]].\n\n===Charlotte Carson===\n'''Charlotte Carson''' (n\u00e9e Moore) (voiced by [[Olivia Wilde]]) is a [[deer]] who was Herb Kazzaz's old girlfriend with whom BoJack was once in love. During a drug and alcohol induced stupor in \"Downer Ending\", BoJack imagines an alternate life where instead of becoming a television star he moves to Maine with Charlotte. In this fantasy, the couple get married, have a daughter named Harper, and lead a quiet rustic lifestyle.\n\nIn \"Still Broken\", Charlotte attended Herb Kazzaz's funeral. In a discussion with BoJack, she mentioned that she visited Herb and read the part in BoJack's book on how he and Herb fought over a telescope. She tells him she only lived in Maine for a month and later moved to [[Tesuque, New Mexico]]. In \"Escape from LA\", BoJack drives to Charlotte's house to find she is married to a dorky bro named Kyle and has two teenage children named Trip (human) and Penny (doe). She also owns a store called \"Your Deer Friend\". During his time in New Mexico, BoJack bonds with the 17-year-old Penny by becoming her \"date\" for prom. While talking with Charlotte later over by her fire pit, the two share a brief kiss. BoJack initially urges her to leave with him anew amidst her protests, eventually relenting. However, Charlotte asks him to leave by the next day, confessing his presence depresses her. Later that night, Charlotte catches BoJack and Penny in a compromising position in his yacht. BoJack apologizes, but she orders him to get off her property before she calls the police, and warns BoJack that if he contacts her or her family again, she will kill him. She returns briefly in the final season, when she and Penny are approached by Paige Sinclair who seeks details of their encounter with BoJack for an article she is writing about his involvement in Sarah Lynn's death. She tells BoJack she doesn't want to be involved and that he has to handle the situation, causing him to hyperventilate and later pass out.\n\n===Penny Carson===\n'''Penny Carson''' (voiced by [[Ilana Glazer]]) \u2013 A deer who is Charlotte and Kyle's daughter, and Trip's sister. She bonds with BoJack while he stays at their home during \"Escape from L.A.\" where he acts as her surrogate date from prom. After returning from the home, she propositions him to have sex which BoJack rejects despite her saying she is of consent age in her state. Charlotte later finds her and BoJack in a compromising position on his yacht and she is sent to her room before either one can explain what happened. In season three, BoJack attempted to reconcile with Penny believing she may have been emotionally damaged because of the incident and finds her at her school [[Oberlin College]]. Penny freaked out when he suddenly appeared and ran off stating that he shouldn't be here. She appears again in season 6 when Paige and Maximilian ask for details about her encounter with BoJack. She considers if it is time to finally come forward, with Charlotte telling her that if she does, she must do it on her own terms.\n\n===Lenny Turteltaub===\n'''Lenny Turteltaub''' (voiced by [[J. K. Simmons|J.K. Simmons]]) is a tortoise and big-shot film producer in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}. He worked with [[Ed Begley|Ed Begley, Sr.]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] during their youth, suggesting that he is extremely old (a reference to the lifespan of actual turtles). He is shown to dislike BoJack but continuously casts him in projects for financial gain. His name is a play off Hollywood producer and director [[Jon Turteltaub]].\n\n===Paparazzi Birds===\nThe '''Paparazzi Birds''' (voiced by [[Adam Conover]] and Dave Segal) are an unnamed [[blue jay]] and [[European robin]] duo who try to get incriminating pictures of BoJack, Diane, and other celebrities. They attempt to blackmail BoJack after taking photos of him having intercourse with Sarah Lynn but are stopped by Vanessa Gekko under threat of a lawsuit for trespassing, paparazziing without a permit and blackmail before threatening to frame them for [[Tupac Shakur| Tupac]]'s murder.\n\n===Tina===\n'''Tina''' is a [[brown bear]] who is the nurse of Herb Kazzaz. In \"Still Broken\", Tina was in collaboration with Henry Winkler to keep Herb's terrible manuscript for a novel from being posthumously published and harming his legacy. Unlike the other anthropomorphic characters on the show, Tina only speaks in growls. Later in season 4, Tina returns as the nurse of BoJack's Mother, Beatrice.\n\n===Sextina Aquafina===\nSextina Aquafina (voiced by [[Aisha Tyler]] in season 1\u20132, [[Daniele Gaither]] in season 3) is a [[bottlenose dolphin]] pop-music sensation. In \"Out to Sea\", Diane meets with Sextina to discuss becoming her social-media ghostwriter. In the season three episode \"Brrap Brrap Pew Pew\", Diane accidentally tweeted out that Sextina was having an abortion while she was being distracted, which caused a media storm. While Sextina was initially angered with the tweet and tried to fire Diane, she later embraced the image because of support from other celebrities. She later released a music video militantly supporting abortion, had her \"abortion\" on live TV, and soon after became pregnant. It is implied that she is sent to a farm where celebrities go to disappear.\n\nAccording to creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, she is based on a girl who was in his and Lisa Hanawalt's English class as a senior in high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/a-gif-of-a-cat-falling-asleep#.cjAx6E0Ln|title=How A Show About A Depressed Horse Became Incredibly Human|first=Ariane|last=Lange|work=BuzzFeed|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Kelsey Jannings===\n'''Kelsey Jannings''' (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]) is a human who was hired to direct the ''Secretariat'' movie. A divorced, lesbian, independent filmmaker, she sees the ''Secretariat'' project as her last chance to break into the big time and make enough money to get her daughter Irving into an Ivy League school (as opposed to [[Vassar College|Vassar]]). Cynical and initially dismissive of BoJack's attitude, she and BoJack grow closer over the course of filming. She has a special fondness for Todd because she likes his face. She is later fired by Lenny Turteltaub in \"The Shot\" for filming a scene that involved Secretariat's encounter with [[Richard Nixon]] which had since been cut from the film.\n\nIn season three, BoJack finds Kelsey at POFF (Pacific Ocean Film Festival) and attempts to reconcile with her through various apology notes, however she cannot understand it because the ink starts to wash away and BoJack is unaware of his suit's voice capabilities until the episode ends. Later in the season, the two discuss doing a serious independent film together called ''Jelly Belle'' to legitimize BoJack as an actor. Unfortunately, this is part of a plan by Vanessa Gekko to sabotage Princess Carolyn's agency, and the film option expires before a deal can be reached. The resulting fallout seemingly ends BoJack's unique professional and artistic connection with Kelsey.\n\nIn season six, Kelsey is struggling to find directing jobs, due in part to her getting fired from the Secretariat film. After giving an impassioned speech about the hurdles she's had to face due to sexism in the film industry, she gets the job directing the female superhero film ''Fireflame''.\n\n===A Ryan Seacrest Type===\n'''A [[Ryan Seacrest]] Type''' (voiced by [[Adam Conover]]) is the name of a human character who hosts \"Excess Hollywood\" (later renamed \"Excess {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" after BoJack steals the D in the [[Hollywood Sign]] and the D is accidentally destroyed in a helicopter crash) and interviews celebrities. He also hosts \"Morning Time, {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" with a female human called Some Lady, and briefly with another co-host named An Actress or Something who is filling in for Some Lady after her apparent kidnapping. In the third season, he is run over by BoJack driving a limo. He is later revealed to have somehow survived and hosts a late night talk show as well as co-hosting Excess {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} with \"A [[Billy Bush]] Type\" (voiced by Kevin Bigley). He briefly co-anchors the ski race between Mr. Peanutbutter and Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz with Tom Jumbo-Grumbo, but quits after being sensitive to the cold weather. In season 5, it is revealed that he also hosts a radio show called The Deep Dive.\n\n===Tom Jumbo-Grumbo===\n'''Tom Jumbo-Grumbo''' (voiced by [[Keith Olbermann]]) is a [[blue whale]] who is a [[News presenter|newsman]] and pundit on MSNBSea (a parody of [[MSNBC]]). Tom often reports on BoJack's misdeeds and other happenings in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}, often through alliteration. Whenever something goes wrong on the air, he blames it all on an off-screen presence only known as \"Randy\", and makes various jokes at the expense of his squid ex-wife Shannon, though he usually immediately apologizes afterwards.\n\n===Wayne===\n'''Wayne''' (voiced by [[Wyatt Cenac]]) is Diane's human ex-boyfriend who is a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] and a [[BuzzFeed]] writer. He conspires with Diane to leak a small portion of BoJack's book to create hype and convince BoJack to allow its publication. They once worked together at [[Starbucks]] before Diane became a published author.\n\n===Vanessa Gekko===\n'''Vanessa Gekko''' (voiced by [[Kristin Chenoweth]]) \u2013 A human {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} talent agent and the rival of Princess Carolyn. She is a seemingly better agent than Princess Carolyn because she has a husband and kids, thereby \"having it all.\" She temporarily shares an office with Princess Carolyn when their agencies merge. Sometime between seasons 2 and 3, she and Rutabaga started their own agency, Gekko-Rabbitowitz, which ultimately sabotages VIM, leading to the latter agency's collapse.\n\n===Charley Witherspoon===\n'''Charley Witherspoon''' (voiced by [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]]) is a [[tree frog]] who is the son of Mr. Witherspoon. He works at the Vigor agency where his hand keeps sticking to things. Charley was briefly Princess Carolyn's assistant, but was later made an agent.\n\nAfter his father's death, he is sworn in as the new President of Vigor. He is shown to be a poor leader, choosing to hire the Utah Jazz as agents rather than basketball players. He offered to buy VIM from Princess Carolyn, however her assistant Judah kept this information from her in order to protect her ego.\n\n===Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface===\n'''Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface''' (voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]]) is a cat who works as a [[police officer]] at the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s 12th Precinct. He takes his duties very seriously, although there is intense disagreement within the police force over whether he is a \"reckless renegade\", a \"loose cannon\", or just a \"cop on the edge with nothing to lose.\"\n\n===Vincent Adultman===\n'''Vincent Adultman''' (voiced by [[Alison Brie]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RaphaelBW/status/621157832893726720|title=Raphael Bob-Waksberg|work=Twitter|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>) is Princess Carolyn's boyfriend for a brief period of time. Everyone except BoJack appears oblivious to (or just does not care about) the fact that Vincent appears to be three children standing atop each other underneath a [[trench coat]]. Though he speaks in a child's voice and has awkward syntax, he also occasionally exhibits strangely keen insight, prompting others to ignore BoJack's observations. In season 2, Princess Carolyn meets Kevin, who appears to be the top child of Vincent's trio. He tells Princess Carolyn that Kevin is Vincent's son, which she believes, but leads to them breaking up.\n\n===Bradley Hitler-Smith===\n'''Bradley Hitler-Smith''' (voiced by [[Adam Conover]]) \u2013 A human actor who played the Horse's adopted son Ethan on ''Horsin' Around''.

In \"Still Broken\", it is revealed that Bradley is living in [[Olympia, Washington]], and that his parents divorced after BoJack had sex with Bradley's mother. In season three, Bradley comes to BoJack with a sequel series idea ''Ethan Around'' which he initially turns down though later comes back when he decides to make amends with Bradley. However, BoJack experiences anxiety when his child co-star mentions wanting to be \"like him\", and he leaves Bradley on the set before the episode can be finished.\n\n===Dr. Allen Hu===\n'''Dr. Allen Hu''' (voiced by [[Ken Jeong]]) is a human pediatric physician/surgeon who frequently sells drugs to Sarah Lynn. Dr. Hu is also seen abusing personally-prescribed narcotics. An [[unseen character]] throughout most of the first season, he is the subject of a recurring joke based on the phonetic similarity of his name to \"who\" with BoJack and others believing that Sarah's drug connection is a man who simply calls himself \"[[Doctor Who]]\" rather than an actual physician. He made his first onscreen appearance in the season one episode \"Downer Ending.\" Hu is brought back in the season five episode \"Ancient History\" where he has since attended drug rehab to clean himself up following the overdose death of Sarah Lynn and will no longer prescribe pills indiscriminately.\n\n===Sebastian St. Clair===\n'''Sebastian St. Clair''' (voiced by [[Keegan-Michael Key]]) \u2013 A [[snow leopard]] billionaire bachelor philanthropist who wants Diane to accompany him to a third world country, Cordovia, to ghostwrite a novel about his work rebuilding the community and caring for the citizens.

She is a television executive for the MBN network and produces the gameshow ''{{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out''. Wanda and BoJack broke up because she doesn't want to date BoJack due to his bitterness and negativity. She was promoted immediately on coming out of the coma as \"no one else had worked there that long.\" She eventually changes networks and is replaced by Pinky Penguin as executive. It is revealed through a sight-gag in the series finale that she eventually went through a second coma.\n\n===Emily===\n'''Emily''' (voiced by [[Abbi Jacobson]]) \u2013 A human love interest of Todd whom he's known since high school.

Mr. Peanutbutter idolizes him and treasures having met him at the awards after-party. He is the host of a TV dance competition ''Hey, I Think You Can Dance''. Hippopopalous is known in the TV industry as Uncle Hankie.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hank After Dark]]\", Diane inadvertently causes a controversy by including the beloved entertainer in a mention of celebrities who have done worse things than BoJack. The controversy involved unspecified allegations made against him by all eight of his female former assistants.\n\n===Roxy===\n'''Roxy''' (voiced by [[Fielding Edlow]]) is Diane's human friend. She was initially introduced as her and Mr. Peanutbutter's wedding officiant in \"Horse Majure\". She worked alongside Diane and Wayne as both a barista and a cater waiter.

However, in season 6, when all the assistants in {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} go on strike, he is brought in to handle negotiations for them and subsequently rehired at VIM. Near the end of the series he professes his love for Princess Carolyn and in the series finale, the two of them are married.

She starred in the movie \"Ms. Taken\", an inter-universe spin-off of the Liam Neeson \"Taken\" movie series, but the film was abandoned by the studio following a series of highly publicized mass shooting incidents.

BoJack then chokes Gina on set while they were filming an episode of Philbert while he was high on painkillers and then does an interview (before the interview, Gina tells BoJack while she'll continue to work with him, she never wants to speak to him again.) to hide the fact that BoJack was really choking her by stating it was all just an act and that they've broken up because of what BoJack did (even having to kiss BoJack to make her statements sound sincere, much to her dismay). Gina has spent most of her career doing small parts and sees Philbert as her chance to finally break out. By season 6, her acting career has taken off, however her experience with BoJack has changed her and caused her to be incredibly anxious on set, especially when doing stunts. This garners her a reputation throughout Hollywoo for being difficult to work with, which seems to cost her a high-profile role in Kelsey Jannings' superhero film ''Fireflame'' (it is revealed in the series finale, however, that she does in fact get the role and stars alongside Courtney Portnoy, who is also considered for the role).\n\n===Pickles Aplenty===\n'''Pickles Aplenty''' (voiced by [[Hong Chau]] in season 5 and [[Julia Chan]] in season 6) (born 1993) is a female pug waitress, and aspiring social media influencer, who works at BoJack's restaurant, and becomes Mr. Peanutbutter's girlfriend in season 5.

This backfires for Mr. Peanutbutter when Pickles and Pogo develop feelings for one another after having sex, and Pickles decides to follow Pogo on tour to be his social media manager, initially maintaining a long-distance relationship with Mr. Peanutbutter.

He appears later in season 6 to be BoJack's AA sponsor after no one is willing to work or talk with BoJack anymore, and the two bond over having been \"canceled.\" Waggoner encourages BoJack to hold onto his anger and continue making content for the small part of the population that still supports him, and directs BoJack in ''The Horny Unicorn'', a bawdy, low-brow comedy.\n\n===Henry Fondle===\n'''Henry Fondle''' (voiced by [[Aaron Paul]]) is a sex robot designed by Todd in an attempt to get Emily to date him again without having sex with her.

She eventually steals BoJack's boat and a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 version of Todd's head and flees into international waters. During the season 3 finale, \"That Went Well\", she's shown to have become delusional after weeks alone in the open sea, believing that the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Todd-head is called \"Skippy\" and that it speaks to her.

In an MSNBSea newscrawl in season 4, it is revealed that she is still lost at sea and presumed dead. In season 5, it is revealed she was found alive by a remote convent with amnesia, with them unaware of her identity.

She later returns for one last scheme, pretending to kidnap Todd and Maude so that Todd can reconnect with his estranged mother.
