Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian [[Hemacandra]], to the effect that the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka is derived from the root carv, \u2018to chew\u2019 : \u201cA C\u0101rv\u0101ka chews the self (carvaty\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e43 c\u0101rv\u0101ka\u1e25). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, U\u1e47\u0101dis\u016btra 37, which runs as follows: mav\u0101ka-\u015by\u0101m\u0101ka-v\u0101rt\u0101ka-jyont\u0101ka-g\u016bv\u0101ka-bhadr\u0101k\u0101daya\u1e25. Each of these words ends with the \u0101ka suffix and is formed irregularly.\u201d{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=166\u2013167}} This may also allude to the philosophy's hedonistic precepts of \"eat, drink, and be merry\".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}\n\nOthers believe it to mean \"agreeable speech\" or pejoratively, \"sweet-tongued\", from Sanskrit's {{IAST|c\u0101ru}} \"agreeable\" and {{IAST|[[v\u0101c]]}} \"speech\" (which becomes {{IAST|[[v\u0101k]]}} in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati.{{sfn|Sharma|1987|p=40}}\n\n===As Lokayata===\nAccording to {{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1992|p=1}}, the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent (''ayatah'') among the people (''lokesu''), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of Lok\u0101yata (\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u092f\u0924) signifies \"directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly\".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}{{efn|See ''loka'' and ''ayata'', Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany; (\u0932\u094b\u0915, loka which means \"worlds, abode, place of truth, people\", and \u0906\u092f\u0924, \u0101yata means \"extended, directed towards, aiming at\"{{sfn|St\u00f6we|2003}} }}\n\nIn early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of ''Lokayata'' has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=187\u2013192}} The name Lok\u0101yata, for example, is found in [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which refers to three ''\u0101nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012bs'' (\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u0940, literally, examining by reason,{{sfn|Hacker|1978|p=164}} logical philosophies) \u2013 [[Raja Yoga|Yoga]], [[Samkhya]] and Lok\u0101yata. However, Lok\u0101yata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies Lok\u0101yata to be a part of Vedic lore.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=188\u2013190}} Lok\u0101yata here refers to logic or science of debate (''disputatio'', \"criticism\").{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=27, 189\u2013191}} Rudolf Franke translated ''Lokayata'' in German as \"logisch beweisende Naturerkl\u00e4rung\", that is \"logically proving explanation of nature\".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|p=188}}\n\nIn 8th century CE Jaina literature, ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'' by Haribhadra,{{sfn|Chapple|2003|p=2}} ''Lokayata'' is stated to be the Hindu school where there is \"no God, no [[samsara]] (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.\"{{sfn|Haribhadras\u016bri |1989|p=}}\n\nThe Buddhist Sanskrit work [[Divyavadana]] (ca. 200\u2013350 CE) mentions ''Lokayata'', where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of \"technical logical science\".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=193\u2013195}} [[Shantarakshita]] and [[Adi Shankara]] use the word ''lokayata'' to mean materialism,{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227\u2013249}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=196}} with the latter using the term Lok\u0101yata, not Charvaka.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2002|p=6}}\n\nIn Sil\u0101\u1e45ka's commentary on ''S\u016btra-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e45gna'', the oldest Jain \u0100gama Prakrt literature, he has used four terms for C\u0101rv\u0101ka viz. (1) B\u1e5bhaspatya (2) Lok\u0101yata (3) Bh\u016btav\u0101din (4) V\u0101mam\u0101rgin.{{sfn|Joshi|1987|p=}}\n\n==Origin==\nThe tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227\u2013249}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}{{efn|\"These atheistical doctrines existed from the earliest times as their traces are visible even in the Rigveda in some hymns of which Prof Max Muller pointed out the curious traces of an incipient scepticism.

Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BCE. There was a base text, a collection s\u016btras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms. This should be seen in the wider context of the oral tradition of Indian philosophy. It was in the 600 BCE onwards, with the emergent popularity of Buddhism that ancient schools started codifying and writing down the details of their philosophy.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\n[[Edward Washburn Hopkins|E. W. Hopkins]], in his ''The Ethics of India'' (1924) claims that Charvaka philosophy predated Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning \"the old C\u0101rv\u0101ka or materialist of the 6th century BC\". [[Rhys Davids]] assumes that ''lok\u0101yata'' in ca. 500 BC came to mean \"skepticism\" in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. This proves that it had already existed for centuries and had become a generic term by 600 BCE. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ramayana#Ayodhya kanda|Ayodhya kanda]], chapter 108, where Jab\u0101li tries to persuade [[Rama|R\u0101ma]] to accept the kingdom by using [[n\u0101stika]] arguments (R\u0101ma refutes him in chapter 109):{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}\n{{Quote|O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge. (2.108.17)}}\n\nThere are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. B\u1e5bhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lok\u0101yata philosophy. {{harvnb|Billington|1997|p=43}} states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BCE, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of ''[[Barhaspatya sutras|Brhaspati Sutra]]''. These sutras predate 150 BC, because they are mentioned in the ''[[Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya]]'' (7.3.45).{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}\n\n{{harvnb|Basham|1981|pp=11\u201317}}, citing the Buddhist ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'', suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and [[Ajivika]]s. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India's [[Timeline of Indian history#13th century|historical timeline]], after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=65\u201374}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception and direct experiments to be the valid and reliable source of knowledge.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}\n\n===Epistemology===\nThe Charvaka [[epistemology]] holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya |2010|pp=529-542}} Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55\u201367}} Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect \u2013 sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=5}}\n\nCharvaka's epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke ([[middle term]]), one's tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire ([[major term]] in logic).{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55\u201367}} Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2013|p=133-149}} Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}\n\nThis epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of in Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Chatterjee |1977|pp=195-209}}\n\n====Comparison with other schools of Hinduism====\nCharvaka epistemology represents minimalist ''[[Pramana|pram\u0101\u1e47as]]'' (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}} To Charvakas, ''Pratyak\u1e63a'' (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. Advaita [[Vedanta]] scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: ''Pratyak\u1e63a'' (perception), ''Anum\u0101\u1e47a'' (inference), ''Upam\u0101\u1e47a'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arth\u0101patti'' (postulation), ''Anupalabdhi'' (non-perception, cognitive proof) and ''\u015aabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} While ''Charvaka'' school accepted just one, the valid means of epistemology in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}\n\n===Metaphysics===\nSince none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=9}}\n\nTherefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], an [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|extracorporeal soul]], the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena.

To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness etc., resided in the body. The ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}}\n{{Quote|\nThere is no other world other than this;<br>\nThere is no heaven and no hell;<br>\nThe realm of Shiva and like regions,<br>\nare fabricated by stupid imposters.\n|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verse 8{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}} }}\n\n===Pleasure===\n{{Hedonism}}Charvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with [[sensual]] pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}\n\nThe ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|pp=44-45}}\n{{Quote|\nThe enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while [[moksha]] is death which is cessation of life-breath... the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of ''moksha''.\n\nA fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings.\n|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verses 9-12{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=45}}}}\n\n===Religion===\nCharvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, such as an [[afterlife]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]] and [[religious rite]]s. They were critical of the [[Vedas]], as well as Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}\n\nThe ''Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha'' with commentaries by [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults \u2013 errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and [[tautology (grammar)|tautology]]. The Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by ''karmakanda'' Vedic priests and ''j\u00f1\u0101nakanda'' Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}{{sfn|Madhavacharya|n.d.|pp=3-7}}{{sfn|Acharya|1894|pp=5-9}}\n\nCharvakas, according to ''Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha'' verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}\n\nCharvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that \"while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on [[ghee]] even though he runs in debt\".{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}\n\nThe Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'', includes Charvaka in his list of six ''[[dar\u015bana]]s'' of Indian traditions, along with [[Buddhism]], [[Nyaya-Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Jainism]] and [[Jaiminiya]].{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435\u2013436|ps=:See verses 78-end (ET99-end)}} Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen.{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435}}\n\nThe accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}}{{sfn|Riepe|1964|p=}}\n\n===Public administration===\nAn extract from ''[[Ain-i-Akbari|Aaine-Akbari]]'' (vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, pp217\u2013218) written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], the famous historian of Akbar's court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's instance. The account is given by the historian [[Vincent Arthur Smith|Vincent Smith]], in his article titled \"The Jain Teachers of Akbar\". Some Carvaka thinkers are said to have participated in the symposium. Under the heading \"Nastika\" Abul Fazl has referred to the good work, judicious administration and welfare schemes that were emphasised by the Charvaka law-makers. Somadeva has also mentioned the Charvaka method of defeating the enemies of the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4E0ctwAACAAJ|title=Astik Shiromani, Charvak|first=A.

The 8th century ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]] with [[Madhyamaka]] influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and [[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e45\u0307graha]] of [[Vidyaranya]] are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought.{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=37}}\n\nIn the epic [[Mahabharata]], Book 12 Chapter 39, a villain who dresses up like a scholar, appoints himself as spokesperson for all scholars, and who then advises [[Yudhishthira]] to act unethically, is named ''Charvaka''.{{sfn|Roy|1894|pp=121-122}}\n\nOne of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the ''[[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e45graha]]'' (etymologically all-philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Vidyaranya|M\u0101dhava Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya]] from [[South India]], which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] (\"by whom the earth and rest were produced\"), Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya asks, in the first chapter:{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}}\n{{Cquote|...but how can we attribute to the Divine Being the giving of supreme felicity, when such a notion has been utterly abolished by Charvaka, the crest-gem of the atheistic school, the follower of the doctrine of Brihaspati? The efforts of Charvaka are indeed hard to be eradicated, for the majority of living beings hold by the current refrain:\n::While life is yours, live joyously;<br/>None can escape Death's searching eye:<br/>When once this frame of ours they burn,<br/>How shall it e'er again return?{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}} }}\n\nSanskrit poems and plays like the Nai\u1e63adha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, [[agamadambara|\u0100gama-dambara]], Vidvanmoda-tara\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b and [[Kadambari|K\u0101dambar\u012b]] contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\n===Loss of original works===\n{{Main|Barhaspatya sutras}}\nThere was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.\"{{sfn|Chatterjee|Datta|2004|p=55}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy on reliability of sources===\n{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}} states that the claims against Charvaka of [[hedonism]], lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars is missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}}\n\nThe ''Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi'' by \u0100ryadevap\u0101da, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy's views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as \u0100ryadevap\u0101da added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas'.{{sfn|Del Toso|2010|pp=543-552}}\n\nBuddhists, [[Jain philosophy|Jains]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantins]] and [[Ny\u0101ya]] philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lok\u0101yata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\nLikewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of [[hedonism]] against Charvaka might have been exaggerated.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}} Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, {{harvnb|Riepe|1964|p=75}} states, \"It may be said from the available material that C\u0101rv\u0101kas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem.\"\n\n==Commentators==\nAviddhakar\u1e47a, Bhavivikta, Kambalasvatara, Purandara and Udbhatabhatta are the five commentators who developed the Carvaka/Lokayata system in various ways. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Commentators on the \"C\u0101rv\u0101kas\u016btra\": A Critical Survey|author1=Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna|author2=BHATTACHARYA, BAMKRISHNA|year=2010|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|volume=38|issue=4|pages=419\u2013430|jstor = 23497726|doi = 10.1007/s10781-010-9088-6}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303919423|title=Materialism in India; After Carvaka|first=Ramkrishna|last=Bhattacharya|date=January 15, 2000|journal=Indian Skeptic|volume=12|pages=31\u201336|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n* [[Dharmakirti]], a 7th-century philosopher deeply influenced by Carvaka philosophy wrote in Pramanvartik.<ref>http://www.vkmaheshwari.com/WP/?p=2769</ref>\n* [[Pyrrho]]\n* The influence of this heterodox doctrine is seen in other spheres of Indian thought.\n\n==References in the modern world==\nIn her newly-published book, controversial US Indologist [[Wendy Doniger]] says the [[Narendra Modi]] government, by making excessive claims about the scientific content of the [[Arthashastra|Arthashatra]], [[Kamasutra]] and other ancient texts, including sceptic Charvakas, is \"promoting\" mythoscience.<ref name=\"counterview.net\" />{{sfn|Doniger|2018|p=}}\n\n==Organisations==\n* The Charvaka Ashram founded by Boddu Ramakrishna in 1973 has stood the test of time and continues to further the cause of the rationalist movement.<ref>https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/heart-andhra-s-booming-capital-lies-quaint-ashram-rationalists-100193</ref>\n\n==Criticism from Abrahamic philosophers==\n[[Ain-i-Akbari]], a record of the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]'s court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's insistence{{sfn|Mubarak|1894|pp=217-218}}(also see {{harvnb|Sen|2005|pp=288\u2013289}}).

Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian [[Hemacandra]], to the effect that the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka is derived from the root carv, \u2018to chew\u2019 : \u201cA C\u0101rv\u0101ka chews the self (carvaty\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e43 c\u0101rv\u0101ka\u1e25). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, U\u1e47\u0101dis\u016btra 37, which runs as follows: mav\u0101ka-\u015by\u0101m\u0101ka-v\u0101rt\u0101ka-jyont\u0101ka-g\u016bv\u0101ka-bhadr\u0101k\u0101daya\u1e25. Each of these words ends with the \u0101ka suffix and is formed irregularly.\u201d{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=166\u2013167}} This may also allude to the philosophy's hedonistic precepts of \"eat, drink, and be merry\".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}\n\nOthers believe it to mean \"agreeable speech\" or pejoratively, \"sweet-tongued\", from Sanskrit's {{IAST|c\u0101ru}} \"agreeable\" and {{IAST|[[v\u0101c]]}} \"speech\" (which becomes {{IAST|[[v\u0101k]]}} in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati.{{sfn|Sharma|1987|p=40}}\n\n===As Lokayata===\nAccording to {{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1992|p=1}}, the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent (''ayatah'') among the people (''lokesu''), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of Lok\u0101yata (\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u092f\u0924) signifies \"directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly\".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}{{efn|See ''loka'' and ''ayata'', Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany; (\u0932\u094b\u0915, loka which means \"worlds, abode, place of truth, people\", and \u0906\u092f\u0924, \u0101yata means \"extended, directed towards, aiming at\"{{sfn|St\u00f6we|2003}} }}\n\nIn early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of ''Lokayata'' has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=187\u2013192}} The name Lok\u0101yata, for example, is found in [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which refers to three ''\u0101nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012bs'' (\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u0940, literally, examining by reason,{{sfn|Hacker|1978|p=164}} logical philosophies) \u2013 [[Raja Yoga|Yoga]], [[Samkhya]] and Lok\u0101yata. However, Lok\u0101yata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies Lok\u0101yata to be a part of Vedic lore.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=188\u2013190}} Lok\u0101yata here refers to logic or science of debate (''disputatio'', \"criticism\").{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=27, 189\u2013191}} Rudolf Franke translated ''Lokayata'' in German as \"logisch beweisende Naturerkl\u00e4rung\", that is \"logically proving explanation of nature\".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|p=188}}\n\nIn 8th century CE Jaina literature, ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'' by Haribhadra,{{sfn|Chapple|2003|p=2}} ''Lokayata'' is stated to be the Hindu school where there is \"no God, no [[samsara]] (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.\"{{sfn|Haribhadras\u016bri |1989|p=}}\n\nThe Buddhist Sanskrit work [[Divyavadana]] (ca. 200\u2013350 CE) mentions ''Lokayata'', where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of \"technical logical science\".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=193\u2013195}} [[Shantarakshita]] and [[Adi Shankara]] use the word ''lokayata'' to mean materialism,{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227\u2013249}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=196}} with the latter using the term Lok\u0101yata, not Charvaka.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2002|p=6}}\n\nIn Sil\u0101\u1e45ka's commentary on ''S\u016btra-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e45gna'', the oldest Jain \u0100gama Prakrt literature, he has used four terms for C\u0101rv\u0101ka viz. (1) B\u1e5bhaspatya (2) Lok\u0101yata (3) Bh\u016btav\u0101din (4) V\u0101mam\u0101rgin.{{sfn|Joshi|1987|p=}}\n\n==Origin==\nThe tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227\u2013249}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}{{efn|\"These atheistical doctrines existed from the earliest times as their traces are visible even in the Rigveda in some hymns of which Prof Max Muller pointed out the curious traces of an incipient scepticism.

Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BCE. There was a base text, a collection s\u016btras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms. This should be seen in the wider context of the oral tradition of Indian philosophy. It was in the 600 BCE onwards, with the emergent popularity of Buddhism that ancient schools started codifying and writing down the details of their philosophy.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\n[[Edward Washburn Hopkins|E. W. Hopkins]], in his ''The Ethics of India'' (1924) claims that Charvaka philosophy predated Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning \"the old C\u0101rv\u0101ka or materialist of the 6th century BC\". [[Rhys Davids]] assumes that ''lok\u0101yata'' in ca. 500 BC came to mean \"skepticism\" in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. This proves that it had already existed for centuries and had become a generic term by 600 BCE. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ramayana#Ayodhya kanda|Ayodhya kanda]], chapter 108, where Jab\u0101li tries to persuade [[Rama|R\u0101ma]] to accept the kingdom by using [[n\u0101stika]] arguments (R\u0101ma refutes him in chapter 109):{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}\n{{Quote|O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge. (2.108.17)}}\n\nThere are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. B\u1e5bhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lok\u0101yata philosophy. {{harvnb|Billington|1997|p=43}} states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BCE, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of ''[[Barhaspatya sutras|Brhaspati Sutra]]''. These sutras predate 150 BC, because they are mentioned in the ''[[Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya]]'' (7.3.45).{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}\n\n{{harvnb|Basham|1981|pp=11\u201317}}, citing the Buddhist ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'', suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and [[Ajivika]]s. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India's [[Timeline of Indian history#13th century|historical timeline]], after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=65\u201374}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception and direct experiments to be the valid and reliable source of knowledge.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}\n\n===Epistemology===\nThe Charvaka [[epistemology]] holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya |2010|pp=529-542}} Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55\u201367}} Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect \u2013 sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=5}}\n\nCharvaka's epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke ([[middle term]]), one's tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire ([[major term]] in logic).{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55\u201367}} Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2013|p=133-149}} Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}\n\nThis epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of in Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Chatterjee |1977|pp=195-209}}\n\n====Comparison with other schools of Hinduism====\nCharvaka epistemology represents minimalist ''[[Pramana|pram\u0101\u1e47as]]'' (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}} To Charvakas, ''Pratyak\u1e63a'' (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. Advaita [[Vedanta]] scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: ''Pratyak\u1e63a'' (perception), ''Anum\u0101\u1e47a'' (inference), ''Upam\u0101\u1e47a'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arth\u0101patti'' (postulation), ''Anupalabdhi'' (non-perception, cognitive proof) and ''\u015aabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} While ''Charvaka'' school accepted just one, the valid means of epistemology in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}\n\n===Metaphysics===\nSince none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=9}}\n\nTherefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], an [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|extracorporeal soul]], the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena. To them all natural phenomena was produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}\n{{Quote|The fire is hot, the water cold, refreshing cool the breeze of morn;<br/>By whom came this variety ? from their own nature was it born.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}} }}\n\n===Consciousness and afterlife===\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\nThe Charvaka did not believe in [[karma]], [[reincarnation|rebirth]] or an [[afterlife]]. To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness etc., resided in the body. The ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}}\n{{Quote|\nThere is no other world other than this;<br>\nThere is no heaven and no hell;<br>\nThe realm of Shiva and like regions,<br>\nare fabricated by stupid imposters.\n|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verse 8{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}} }}\n\n===Pleasure===\n{{Hedonism}}Charvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with [[sensual]] pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}\n\nThe ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|pp=44-45}}\n{{Quote|\nThe enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while [[moksha]] is death which is cessation of life-breath... the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of ''moksha''.\n\nA fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings.\n|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verses 9-12{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=45}}}}\n\n===Religion===\nCharvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, such as an [[afterlife]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]] and [[religious rite]]s. They were critical of the [[Vedas]], as well as Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}\n\nThe ''Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha'' with commentaries by [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults \u2013 errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and [[tautology (grammar)|tautology]]. The Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by ''karmakanda'' Vedic priests and ''j\u00f1\u0101nakanda'' Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}{{sfn|Madhavacharya|n.d.|pp=3-7}}{{sfn|Acharya|1894|pp=5-9}}\n\nCharvakas, according to ''Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha'' verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}\n\nCharvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that \"while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on [[ghee]] even though he runs in debt\".{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}\n\nThe Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'', includes Charvaka in his list of six ''[[dar\u015bana]]s'' of Indian traditions, along with [[Buddhism]], [[Nyaya-Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Jainism]] and [[Jaiminiya]].{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435\u2013436|ps=:See verses 78-end (ET99-end)}} Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen.{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435}}\n\nThe accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}}{{sfn|Riepe|1964|p=}}\n\n===Public administration===\nAn extract from ''[[Ain-i-Akbari|Aaine-Akbari]]'' (vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, pp217\u2013218) written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], the famous historian of Akbar's court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's instance. The account is given by the historian [[Vincent Arthur Smith|Vincent Smith]], in his article titled \"The Jain Teachers of Akbar\". Some Carvaka thinkers are said to have participated in the symposium. Under the heading \"Nastika\" Abul Fazl has referred to the good work, judicious administration and welfare schemes that were emphasised by the Charvaka law-makers. Somadeva has also mentioned the Charvaka method of defeating the enemies of the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4E0ctwAACAAJ|title=Astik Shiromani, Charvak|first=A.

The 8th century ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]] with [[Madhyamaka]] influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and [[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e45\u0307graha]] of [[Vidyaranya]] are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought.{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=37}}\n\nIn the epic [[Mahabharata]], Book 12 Chapter 39, a villain who dresses up like a scholar, appoints himself as spokesperson for all scholars, and who then advises [[Yudhishthira]] to act unethically, is named ''Charvaka''.{{sfn|Roy|1894|pp=121-122}}\n\nOne of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the ''[[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e45graha]]'' (etymologically all-philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Vidyaranya|M\u0101dhava Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya]] from [[South India]], which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] (\"by whom the earth and rest were produced\"), Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya asks, in the first chapter:{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}}\n{{Cquote|...but how can we attribute to the Divine Being the giving of supreme felicity, when such a notion has been utterly abolished by Charvaka, the crest-gem of the atheistic school, the follower of the doctrine of Brihaspati? The efforts of Charvaka are indeed hard to be eradicated, for the majority of living beings hold by the current refrain:\n::While life is yours, live joyously;<br/>None can escape Death's searching eye:<br/>When once this frame of ours they burn,<br/>How shall it e'er again return?{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}} }}\n\nSanskrit poems and plays like the Nai\u1e63adha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, [[agamadambara|\u0100gama-dambara]], Vidvanmoda-tara\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b and [[Kadambari|K\u0101dambar\u012b]] contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\n===Loss of original works===\n{{Main|Barhaspatya sutras}}\nThere was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.\"{{sfn|Chatterjee|Datta|2004|p=55}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy on reliability of sources===\n{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}} states that the claims against Charvaka of [[hedonism]], lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars is missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}}\n\nThe ''Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi'' by \u0100ryadevap\u0101da, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy's views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as \u0100ryadevap\u0101da added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas'.{{sfn|Del Toso|2010|pp=543-552}}\n\nBuddhists, [[Jain philosophy|Jains]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantins]] and [[Ny\u0101ya]] philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lok\u0101yata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}\n\nLikewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of [[hedonism]] against Charvaka might have been exaggerated.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29\u201332}} Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, {{harvnb|Riepe|1964|p=75}} states, \"It may be said from the available material that C\u0101rv\u0101kas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem.\"\n\n==Commentators==\nAviddhakar\u1e47a, Bhavivikta, Kambalasvatara, Purandara and Udbhatabhatta are the five commentators who developed the Carvaka/Lokayata system in various ways. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Commentators on the \"C\u0101rv\u0101kas\u016btra\": A Critical Survey|author1=Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna|author2=BHATTACHARYA, BAMKRISHNA|year=2010|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|volume=38|issue=4|pages=419\u2013430|jstor = 23497726|doi = 10.1007/s10781-010-9088-6}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303919423|title=Materialism in India; After Carvaka|first=Ramkrishna|last=Bhattacharya|date=January 15, 2000|journal=Indian Skeptic|volume=12|pages=31\u201336|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n* [[Dharmakirti]], a 7th-century philosopher deeply influenced by Carvaka philosophy wrote in Pramanvartik.<ref>http://www.vkmaheshwari.com/WP/?p=2769</ref>\n* [[Pyrrho]]\n* The influence of this heterodox doctrine is seen in other spheres of Indian thought.\n\n==References in the modern world==\nIn her newly-published book, controversial US Indologist [[Wendy Doniger]] says the [[Narendra Modi]] government, by making excessive claims about the scientific content of the [[Arthashastra|Arthashatra]], [[Kamasutra]] and other ancient texts, including sceptic Charvakas, is \"promoting\" mythoscience.<ref name=\"counterview.net\" />{{sfn|Doniger|2018|p=}}\n\n==Organisations==\n* The Charvaka Ashram founded by Boddu Ramakrishna in 1973 has stood the test of time and continues to further the cause of the rationalist movement.<ref>https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/heart-andhra-s-booming-capital-lies-quaint-ashram-rationalists-100193</ref>\n\n==Criticism from Abrahamic philosophers==\n[[Ain-i-Akbari]], a record of the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]'s court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's insistence{{sfn|Mubarak|1894|pp=217-218}}(also see {{harvnb|Sen|2005|pp=288\u2013289}}).

During this interlude (sometimes similar to Marty Callner's 1984 \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\" video for Twisted Sister<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20396305_316325,00.html|title=It Ain't Stealing, It's Video Homage|work=EW.com|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>) an 11-year-old boy ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) is dancing to rock music in his bedroom at night, causing four baseball team [[bobblehead]]s (from left to right, the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]], the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]], the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]]) to bobble. This attracts the attention of his bad-tempered father ([[George Wendt]]), who furiously remonstrates him to stop playing the music and go to bed. After his father exits out and slams the door behind him (causing a Michael Jackson poster on the door to fall off and its glass frame to smash), the boy retaliates by setting up large speaker cabinets hooked up to an amplifier (with levels of \"LOUD\", \"LOUDER\", and \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\", respectively; with the dial turned up all the way to \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\") behind his father's reclining chair, wearing leather gloves and sunglasses, strapping on an Ernie Ball Music Man EVH signature model guitar and playing a [[power chord]], and telling the father to \"Eat this!\".<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> The sound then shatters and destroys the house windows and sends his father (seated in the chair) through the roof and halfway around the world, where the actual song begins.<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> The boy's mother ([[Tess Harper]]), suggests that his father will be very upset when he gets back. The album version of the song does not feature Culkin's nor Wendt's voice; they are replaced by voiceover artists performing a similar intro. The boy's father crashes in Africa, and Jackson sings \"Black or White\", surrounded by different cultures scene-by-scene.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/>\n\nThe video shows scenes in which African Zulu hunters begin dancing by using moves from Southern African dance{{dubious|date=July 2017}}, with Jackson following their moves and them mirroring his; as do, in sequence, [[Dance in Thailand|traditional Thai dancers]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Plains Native Americans]] (located at the [[Vasquez Rocks]] formation in California), a [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] [[Odissi]] dancer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.srilankafoundation.org/newsfeed/sri-lankan-dancer-yamuna-sangarasivam-danced-with-michael-jackson/|title=Sri Lankan dancer Yamuna Sangarasivam danced with Michael Jackson|website=Sri Lanka Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> and a group of [[Russian culture|Russians]]<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> (wearing [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian clothing]] and dancing [[Hopak]]), the final scene of which is contained in a snowglobe, two babies (one white and one black) are playing with. Jackson walks through visual collages of fire (defiantly declaring \"I ain't scared of no sheets; I ain't scared of nobody\"), referring to [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] torch ceremonies before a mock rap scene joined with Culkin and other children (including Jackson's niece Brandi and [[Wade Robson]]; as well as Mark Pugh and David Shelton of [[Another Bad Creation]]).<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> The group collectively states, \"I'm not gonna spend my life being a color.\" The final verse is performed by Jackson on a large sculpted torch, which the camera pans out to reveal as the [[Statue of Liberty]] (New York). Jackson is seen singing on Lady Liberty's torch surrounded by other famous world structures including [[Great Sphinx of Giza|The Giza Sphinx]] (Egypt), [[Hagia Sophia]] (Turkey), [[Pamukkale]] (Turkey), [[The Parthenon]] (Greece), [[Taj Mahal]] (India), [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] (Moscow), [[Pyramids of Giza]] (Egypt), [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (San Francisco), [[Big Ben]] (London) and the [[Eiffel Tower]] (Paris).\n\nAt the end of the video, different people of different ethnicities and nationalities, including actor [[Glen Chin]], voice actress [[Cree Summer]], model [[Tyra Banks]], actress [[Khrystyne Haje]], and actor [[Jeffrey Anderson-Gunter]], dance as they morph into one another (shown as \"talking heads\"). This technique, previously executed without digital assistance in the [[Godley & Creme]] video for \"[[Cry (Godley & Creme song)|Cry]]\", known as [[morphing]], had been previously used only in movies such as ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''. The morphing visual effects were created by [[Pacific Data Images]].<ref name=\"halstead, cadman (2003) 99\"/> In the extended version of the music video, after the song, a black panther walks out of the studio and emerges into Jackson, as he dances and destroys a glass bottle, a building window, and a parked car labeled with spray-painted racist words in a city street. After his damage, he re-emerges into the black panther. Finally, [[Bart Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' dances to the song while watching it on the TV. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] yells at him to \"Turn off that noise!\" Bart replies, \"Chill out, Homeboy.\" Then, Homer angrily turns the TV off.\n\nThe music video of the song appears on the video albums: ''[[Dangerous: The Short Films]]'' (long version), ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' (long version, without graffiti on VHS version but with graffiti on DVD version), ''[[Number Ones (video)|Number Ones]]'' (short version), and ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' (long version without graffiti).\n\n===Controversy and censorship===\n[[File:Blackorwhite comparison.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Music video comparison|A comparison between the two versions of Michael Jackson's \"Black or White\" music video: the original version and the computer-altered racist graffiti version (with the messages reading '''''\"[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Lives\"''''' with '''''\"[[swastika]]\"''''', '''''\"[[Nigger]] Go Home\"''''', '''''\"No More [[Wetback (slur)|Wetback]]s\"''''' and '''''\"[[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] Rules\"''''').]]\nControversy was generated concerning the last four minutes of the original music video. Jackson walks out of the studio as a [[black panther]] and then morphs into himself.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> Then he walks outside to perform some of his most physically complicated dance techniques, in a similar way to \"[[Billie Jean]]\". The scene is also very similar to that of a commercial Jackson appeared in for [[L.A. Gear]] in 1989. This part contained sexually suggestive scenes when Jackson starts to grab his crotch,<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> and then zips his pants up. In the original version, Jackson is seen smashing windows,<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> destroying a car and causing an inn (called the \"Royal Arms\") to explode. Jackson later apologized saying that the violent and suggestive behavior was an interpretation of the animal instinct of a black panther, and MTV and other music video networks removed the last four minutes from subsequent broadcasts.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> To make the vandalism and violence more understandable to viewers, an altered version was produced, with racial messages added via [[Computer Generated Imagery|CGI]] graffiti to the windows Jackson breaks. The version included in the boxed set ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' is the aired, televised version without the graffiti, and does not include the \"prejudice is ignorance\" title card.\n\nTo date, the uncut version has generally been seen in the United States on [[MTV2]] only between the hours of 1:00 and 4:00, as part of their special uncut airing of the \"Most Controversial Music Videos\" of all time. The extended version is also available on Jackson's DVDs. The original version (without graffiti) is available on the DVD releases of ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' with the VHS and Laserdisc release containing the aired version, and online at MTVMusic.com. It was still shown in its entirety for some years in Europe. Indeed, UK channel [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] aired the full video at 14:00 on April 11, 2010, including the cameo appearance by Bart Simpson and Homer Simpson before the \"prejudice is ignorance\" image. MTV Classic have continued to air the full video post-watershed and recently aired in September 2012.\n\nThe uncut version was also shown in Australia at 11:45&nbsp;pm [[Time in Australia|AEST]] on Saturday June 2, 2012 as the first song on the weekly late night, guest-programmed music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'', on [[ABC1]] and in Europe (except Italy, San Marino and the United Kingdom), on [[VH1 Classic (European TV channel)|VH1 Classic]] at 21:30 [[Central European Time|CET]] on Saturday, September 29, 2018.\n\nThe first version made available in the [[iTunes Store]] contains neither the panther scene nor ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} cameo, and is cut after the morphing sequence. Since then, a new version has been released with the graffiti and The Simpsons cameo called \"Black or White (Michael Jackson's Vision).\"\n\nStarting in 1992, Nocturne Video Productions began playing the \"Panther Segment\" of the video as an interlude during Michael's ''Dangerous'' world tour. The clip is 20 seconds shorter than the original, omitting all the violence and the sexually suggestive scenes.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> The scene of the pants re-zipping was retained. In predominantly Muslim countries during the HIStory Tour, the scene was replaced with the [[Carmina Burana]] \"Brace Yourself\" montage originally used as the intro in the previous Dangerous Tour.\n\n==Track listings==\n{{col-begin}}\n\n=== 7\": Epic / 657598 7 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== 7\": Epic / 34-74100 (US) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== 12\": Epic / 657598 6 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" - 3:22\n# \"Bad\" - 4:04\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White (Instrumental)\" - 3:22\n# \"Thriller\" - 5:57\n\n=== 12\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole Remixes): Epic / 657731 6 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Club Mix) \u2013 7:36\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Dub Mix) \u2013 6:34\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (The Underground Club Mix) \u2013 7:29\n# \"Black or White\" (House With Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:38\n\n=== Limited Edition 12\": Epic / 49 74099 (US) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivilles & Cole House/Club Mix) \u2013 7:33\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivilles & Cole House/Dub Mix) \u2013 6:27\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (House with Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:34\n\n=== CD: Epic / 657598 2 (UK) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (single version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Smooth Criminal\" - 4:16\n\n=== CD (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole Remixes): Epic / 657731 2 (UK) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Club Mix) \u2013 7:36\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Dub Mix) \u2013 6:34\n# \"Black or White\" (The Underground Club Mix) \u2013 7:29\n# \"Black or White\" (House With Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:38\n\n=== CD: Epic / 34K 74100 (US) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== UK Promo VHS (PAL) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (Domestic Version) (Music Video) - 11:00\n\n===  Visionary ===\n;CD side\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n;DVD side\n# \"Black or White\" (Music Video) \u2013 11:00\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Covers and cultural impact==\n{{Prose|date=October 2013}}\n\"Black or White\" has been covered by some artists since its release.\n\n*In 1991, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] recorded a parody of \"Black or White\" titled \"Snack All Night\", which was never released.

Little Chrissy responds to the question of what makes him happy: he likes having fun \"no matter if he's wet or dry\", and demonstrates by playing his piano on both a stage and underwater (surrounded by fish). \"Wet\" and \"dry\" are further demonstrated with several kids, Mr. Handford, and Maria getting buckets of water dumped on them. Both the song and video spoof \"Black or White\".\n*In 2013, as the new rules in the Code of Points for rhythmic gymnastics allowed music with words.

This attracts the attention of his bad-tempered father ([[George Wendt]]), who furiously remonstrates him to stop playing the music and go to bed. After his father exits out and slams the door behind him (causing a Michael Jackson poster on the door to fall off and its glass frame to smash), the boy retaliates by setting up large speaker cabinets hooked up to an amplifier (with levels of \"LOUD\", \"LOUDER\", and \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\", respectively; with the dial turned up all the way to \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\") behind his father's reclining chair, wearing leather gloves and sunglasses, strapping on an Ernie Ball Music Man EVH signature model guitar and playing a [[power chord]], and telling the father to \"Eat this!\".<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> The sound then shatters and destroys the house windows and sends his father (seated in the chair) through the roof and halfway around the world, where the actual song begins.<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> The boy's mother ([[Tess Harper]]), suggests that his father will be very upset when he gets back. The album version of the song does not feature Culkin's nor Wendt's voice; they are replaced by voiceover artists performing a similar intro. The boy's father crashes in Africa, and Jackson sings \"Black or White\", surrounded by different cultures scene-by-scene.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/>\n\nThe video shows scenes in which African Zulu hunters begin dancing by using moves from Southern African dance{{dubious|date=July 2017}}, with Jackson following their moves and them mirroring his; as do, in sequence, [[Dance in Thailand|traditional Thai dancers]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Plains Native Americans]] (located at the [[Vasquez Rocks]] formation in California), a [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] [[Odissi]] dancer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.srilankafoundation.org/newsfeed/sri-lankan-dancer-yamuna-sangarasivam-danced-with-michael-jackson/|title=Sri Lankan dancer Yamuna Sangarasivam danced with Michael Jackson|website=Sri Lanka Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> and a group of [[Russian culture|Russians]]<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> (wearing [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian clothing]] and dancing [[Hopak]]), the final scene of which is contained in a snowglobe, two babies (one white and one black) are playing with. Jackson walks through visual collages of fire (defiantly declaring \"I ain't scared of no sheets; I ain't scared of nobody\"), referring to [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] torch ceremonies before a mock rap scene joined with Culkin and other children (including Jackson's niece Brandi and [[Wade Robson]]; as well as Mark Pugh and David Shelton of [[Another Bad Creation]]).<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> The group collectively states, \"I'm not gonna spend my life being a color.\" The final verse is performed by Jackson on a large sculpted torch, which the camera pans out to reveal as the [[Statue of Liberty]] (New York). Jackson is seen singing on Lady Liberty's torch surrounded by other famous world structures including [[Great Sphinx of Giza|The Giza Sphinx]] (Egypt), [[Hagia Sophia]] (Turkey), [[Pamukkale]] (Turkey), [[The Parthenon]] (Greece), [[Taj Mahal]] (India), [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] (Moscow), [[Pyramids of Giza]] (Egypt), [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (San Francisco), [[Big Ben]] (London) and the [[Eiffel Tower]] (Paris).\n\nAt the end of the video, different people of different ethnicities and nationalities, including actor [[Glen Chin]], voice actress [[Cree Summer]], model [[Tyra Banks]], actress [[Khrystyne Haje]], and actor [[Jeffrey Anderson-Gunter]], dance as they morph into one another (shown as \"talking heads\"). This technique, previously executed without digital assistance in the [[Godley & Creme]] video for \"[[Cry (Godley & Creme song)|Cry]]\", known as [[morphing]], had been previously used only in movies such as ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''. The morphing visual effects were created by [[Pacific Data Images]].<ref name=\"halstead, cadman (2003) 99\"/> In the extended version of the music video, after the song, a black panther walks out of the studio and emerges into Jackson, as he dances and destroys a glass bottle, a building window, and a parked car labeled with spray-painted racist words in a city street. After his damage, he re-emerges into the black panther. Finally, [[Bart Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' dances to the song while watching it on the TV. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] yells at him to \"Turn off that noise!\" Bart replies, \"Chill out, Homeboy.\" Then, Homer angrily turns the TV off.\n\nThe music video of the song appears on the video albums: ''[[Dangerous: The Short Films]]'' (long version), ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' (long version, without graffiti on VHS version but with graffiti on DVD version), ''[[Number Ones (video)|Number Ones]]'' (short version), and ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' (long version without graffiti).\n\n===Controversy and censorship===\n[[File:Blackorwhite comparison.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Music video comparison|A comparison between the two versions of Michael Jackson's \"Black or White\" music video: the original version and the computer-altered racist graffiti version (with the messages reading '''''\"[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Lives\"''''' with '''''\"[[swastika]]\"''''', '''''\"[[Nigger]] Go Home\"''''', '''''\"No More [[Wetback (slur)|Wetback]]s\"''''' and '''''\"[[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] Rules\"''''').]]\nControversy was generated concerning the last four minutes of the original music video. Jackson walks out of the studio as a [[black panther]] and then morphs into himself.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> Then he walks outside to perform some of his most physically complicated dance techniques, in a similar way to \"[[Billie Jean]]\". The scene is also very similar to that of a commercial Jackson appeared in for [[L.A. Gear]] in 1989. This part contained sexually suggestive scenes when Jackson starts to grab his crotch,<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> and then zips his pants up. In the original version, Jackson is seen smashing windows,<ref name=\"openstheblitz\"/> destroying a car and causing an inn (called the \"Royal Arms\") to explode. Jackson later apologized saying that the violent and suggestive behavior was an interpretation of the animal instinct of a black panther, and MTV and other music video networks removed the last four minutes from subsequent broadcasts.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> To make the vandalism and violence more understandable to viewers, an altered version was produced, with racial messages added via [[Computer Generated Imagery|CGI]] graffiti to the windows Jackson breaks. The version included in the boxed set ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' is the aired, televised version without the graffiti, and does not include the \"prejudice is ignorance\" title card.\n\nTo date, the uncut version has generally been seen in the United States on [[MTV2]] only between the hours of 1:00 and 4:00, as part of their special uncut airing of the \"Most Controversial Music Videos\" of all time. The extended version is also available on Jackson's DVDs. The original version (without graffiti) is available on the DVD releases of ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' with the VHS and Laserdisc release containing the aired version, and online at MTVMusic.com. It was still shown in its entirety for some years in Europe. Indeed, UK channel [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] aired the full video at 14:00 on April 11, 2010, including the cameo appearance by Bart Simpson and Homer Simpson before the \"prejudice is ignorance\" image. MTV Classic have continued to air the full video post-watershed and recently aired in September 2012.\n\nThe uncut version was also shown in Australia at 11:45&nbsp;pm [[Time in Australia|AEST]] on Saturday June 2, 2012 as the first song on the weekly late night, guest-programmed music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'', on [[ABC1]] and in Europe (except Italy, San Marino and the United Kingdom), on [[VH1 Classic (European TV channel)|VH1 Classic]] at 21:30 [[Central European Time|CET]] on Saturday, September 29, 2018.\n\nThe first version made available in the [[iTunes Store]] contains neither the panther scene nor ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} cameo, and is cut after the morphing sequence. Since then, a new version has been released with the graffiti and The Simpsons cameo called \"Black or White (Michael Jackson's Vision).\"\n\nStarting in 1992, Nocturne Video Productions began playing the \"Panther Segment\" of the video as an interlude during Michael's ''Dangerous'' world tour. The clip is 20 seconds shorter than the original, omitting all the violence and the sexually suggestive scenes.<ref name=\"altersnewvideo\"/> The scene of the pants re-zipping was retained. In predominantly Muslim countries during the HIStory Tour, the scene was replaced with the [[Carmina Burana]] \"Brace Yourself\" montage originally used as the intro in the previous Dangerous Tour.\n\n==Track listings==\n{{col-begin}}\n\n=== 7\": Epic / 657598 7 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== 7\": Epic / 34-74100 (US) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== 12\": Epic / 657598 6 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" - 3:22\n# \"Bad\" - 4:04\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White (Instrumental)\" - 3:22\n# \"Thriller\" - 5:57\n\n=== 12\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole Remixes): Epic / 657731 6 (UK) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Club Mix) \u2013 7:36\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Dub Mix) \u2013 6:34\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (The Underground Club Mix) \u2013 7:29\n# \"Black or White\" (House With Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:38\n\n=== Limited Edition 12\": Epic / 49 74099 (US) ===\n;Side one\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivilles & Cole House/Club Mix) \u2013 7:33\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivilles & Cole House/Dub Mix) \u2013 6:27\n;Side two\n# \"Black or White\" (House with Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:34\n\n=== CD: Epic / 657598 2 (UK) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (single version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Smooth Criminal\" - 4:16\n\n=== CD (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole Remixes): Epic / 657731 2 (UK) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Club Mix) \u2013 7:36\n# \"Black or White\" (The Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House / Dub Mix) \u2013 6:34\n# \"Black or White\" (The Underground Club Mix) \u2013 7:29\n# \"Black or White\" (House With Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n# \"Black or White\" (Tribal Beats) \u2013 3:38\n\n=== CD: Epic / 34K 74100 (US) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n=== UK Promo VHS (PAL) ===\n# \"Black or White\" (Domestic Version) (Music Video) - 11:00\n\n===  Visionary ===\n;CD side\n# \"Black or White\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Black or White\" (Clivill\u00e9s & Cole House Guitar Radio Mix) \u2013 3:53\n;DVD side\n# \"Black or White\" (Music Video) \u2013 11:00\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Covers and cultural impact==\n{{Prose|date=October 2013}}\n\"Black or White\" has been covered by some artists since its release.\n\n*In 1991, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] recorded a parody of \"Black or White\" titled \"Snack All Night\", which was never released. Although Jackson was a long-time supporter of Yankovic's work and had approved past parodies, he told Yankovic that he was reluctant to approve a parody of \"Black or White\" because of the message of the song.<ref name=\"yankovic\">{{cite web|last1=Weingarten|first1=Christopher R.|title='Weird Al' Yankovic Looks Back At 20 Years Of 'Smells Like Nirvana' {{!}} SPIN|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/10/weird-al-yankovic-looks-back-at-20-years-of-smells-like-nirvana/|website=SPIN|accessdate=8 August 2016|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> Yankovic believes that Jackson's rejection of the parody was ultimately for the best, because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the song and its scrapping left room on his next album for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\", one of his biggest hits.<ref name=\"yankovic\"/> As with other rejected parodies, Yankovic has performed \"Snack All Night\" during his concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/setlists.htm |title=\"Weird Al\" Yankovic: Concert Set Lists |publisher=Weirdal.com |accessdate=2011-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722011850/http://www.weirdal.com/setlists.htm |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n*In 2009, singer [[Adam Lambert]] performed the song on the [[American Idol (season 8)|8th season of ''American Idol'']] during the Michael Jackson episode,<ref>{{cite web|author= 03/10/2009 |url= http://mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-season-8-top-13-performance-video.htm |title= American Idol Season 8 \u2013 Top 13 Performance: Adam Lambert, Alexis Grace, Allison Iraheta, Anoop Desai, Danny Gokey, Jasmine Murray, Jorge Nunez, Kris Allen, Lil Rounds, Matt Giraud, Megan Corkrey, Michael Sarver, Scott MacIntyre |publisher= mjsbigblog |date= June 30, 2009 |accessdate= 2011-07-26}}</ref> which was re-aired on June 29, as a tribute to Jackson who died on June 25.\n*In the early 1990s, the children's show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' also spoofed the song with a song called \"Wet or Dry\". Little Chrissy responds to the question of what makes him happy: he likes having fun \"no matter if he's wet or dry\", and demonstrates by playing his piano on both a stage and underwater (surrounded by fish). \"Wet\" and \"dry\" are further demonstrated with several kids, Mr. Handford, and Maria getting buckets of water dumped on them. Both the song and video spoof \"Black or White\".\n*In 2013, as the new rules in the Code of Points for rhythmic gymnastics allowed music with words.

Duncan (2005/2006), www.TheSocialContract.com</ref>\n\n== Details of theory ==\nIndustrial civilization is defined in Duncan's paper as the time between [[Energy development|energy production]] ''[[per capita]]'' rising above 37% of its eventual peak value, and it falling back below 37% of the peak value later. In 1996, he estimated this period to be from 1930 until approximately 2025, with the ''per capita'' peak having occurred in 1977.<ref name=\"dieoff125\"/> In 2009, he considered separately the peaks of [[standard of living]] in [[OECD]] countries, non-OECD countries (specifically China, India and Brazil), and the USA. He found that the standard of living in the US peaked in 1973, that of OECD countries in 2005, while that of the non-OECD countries was still rising in 2007. He predicted a global peak in standard of living in 2010, followed by a decline to the 1930 level by 2030.<ref name=\"SocialContract\"/>\n\nThe Olduvai theory claims that [[exponential growth]] of energy production ended in 1979, that [[Energy|energy use]] ''per capita'' will show no growth through 2008, and that after 2008 energy growth will become sharply negative, culminating, after a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], in a [[world population]] of 2 billion circa 2050. <ref name=\"SocialContract\"/>\n\nThe Olduvai theory divides human history into three phases. The first \"[[pre-industrial]]\" phase stretches over most of human history when simple tools and weak machines limited [[economic growth]]. The second \"industrial\" phase encompasses modern industrial civilization where machines temporarily lift all [[Limits to Growth|limits to growth]]. The final \"[[Deindustrialization|de-industrial]]\" phase follows where industrial economies decline to a period of equilibrium with [[renewable resource]]s and the natural environment.<ref name=\"dieoff224\"/>\n\nThe decline of the industrial phase is broken into three sections:\n* The Olduvai slope (1979&ndash;1999)\u2014energy ''per capita'' 'declined at 0.33%/year'\n* The Olduvai slide (2000&ndash;2011)\u2014'begins \u2026 with the escalating warfare in the Middle East\u2026 marks the all-time [[peak oil|peak of world oil production]]'.\n* The Olduvai cliff (2012&ndash;2030)\u2014'begins \u2026 in 2012 when an epidemic of permanent blackouts spreads worldwide, i.e. first there are waves of brownouts and temporary blackouts, then finally the [[electric power]] networks themselves expire'. This is partly connected to fossil fuel production, as coal and natural gas are significant fuel sources in electricity generation, but it is unclear how nuclear power generation fails, if at all.\n\n==Criticism==\n===Data===\nAt the time of Duncan's paper, the peak in ''per capita'' energy consumption was 11.15 boe/c/yr ([[barrels of oil equivalent]] ''per capita'' per year) and occurred in 1979; however, since then energy use ''per capita'' has increased beyond that level, with 2006 providing a peak value of 12.12 boe/c/yr.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls World Per Capita Total Primary Energy Consumption, 1980-2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013182222/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls |date=2006-10-13 }} - [[Energy Information Administration]], 2006 (Excel Sheet)</ref><ref>[http://www.physics.uci.edu/~silverma/units.html Energy Units and Conversions] - Dennis Silverman, UC Irvine</ref>  This increase directly contradicts Postulate 2 of the most recent version of the theory, namely that \"''[average ''per capita'' energy] will show no growth from 1979 to circa 2008''\".<ref name=\"SocialContract\"/>  Duncan has responded to this criticism in a 2009 essay entitled The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living.<ref name=\"SocialContract2009\">[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_19_4/tsc_19_4_duncan.shtml \"The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living\"] - Duncan, R. C. (2009), www.TheSocialContract.com</ref> The response is that certain non-OPEC countries such as China and India have increased their ''per capita'' energy usage whilst efficiency improvements within the USA & OPEC have reduced their requirements for energy without impacting the quality of life. The theory is then re-assessed from the standpoint OPEC, non-OPEC and USA energy consumption. \n\nProponents note that the current trend of increasing ''per capita'' energy consumption may be difficult to sustain in the face of limits on [[fossil fuel]] resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas.<ref>[http://www.theoildrum.com/story/2006/3/6/135437/7111 Revisiting the Olduvai Theory] - The Oil Drum, March 6, 2006</ref> However, advances in [[renewable energy]] have reduced dependence on fossil fuels. For example, in 2015 [[Sweden]] produced approximately 8,153 kWh of electricity per capita per year (5.01 boe/c/yr) from renewable resources, with the exclusion of hydropower; Sweden's theoretical maximum electric generation capacity from renewable resources, including hydropower, is estimated to be 24,472 kWh per capita per year (15.03 boe/c/yr) at the current population level.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.worlddata.info/europe/sweden/energy-consumption.php\n |title=Energy consumption in Sweden\n |website=WorldData.info\n |publisher= Eglitis-media\n |access-date= 3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Quote==\nIn justification of his reference to Olduvai Gorge, Duncan writes:<ref> Richard C.

Carter called Keem a \"very rash decision maker\" and showed clips of Keem saying what he called \"really regrettable shit\". In response, Keem called the ''Content Cop'' video \"entertaining\" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has \"no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews\".

In October [[1875]], his play \"Cr\u00e2ne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fianc\u00e9e, is scandalous.

This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, \u00c9vanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].\n\nThe author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. \u00c9vanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions.
