Since then, the locality has been intensively studied by scientists throughout the world, yielding a constant flow of new discoveries and triggering an extensive scientific debate surrounding the interpretation of discoveries. Over this time, taxa have been revised or reassigned to different groups. Interpretations have led to many refinements of the [[phylogeny]] of groups and even the erection of the new phylum [[Vetulicolia]] of primitive [[deuterostomes]].\n\nThe Chengjiang biota has all the animal groups found in the Burgess Shale; however, since it is ten million years older, it more strongly supports the deduction that metazoans diversified earlier or faster in the early Cambrian than does the Burgess Shale fauna alone. The preservation of an extremely diverse faunal assemblage renders the Maotianshan shale the world's most important for understanding the evolution of early multi-cellular life, particularly the members of phylum [[Chordata]], which includes all [[vertebrates]]. The Chengjiang fossils comprise the oldest diverse [[metazoan]] assemblage above the [[Proterozoic]]-[[Phanerozoic]] transition and, thus, the [[fossil record]]'s best data source for understanding the apparently rapid diversification of life known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]].\n\n== Preservation and taphonomy ==\n[[File:Maotianshania-cylindrica.jpg|thumb|right|''Maotianshania cylindrica'', a [[fossil]] [[Nematomorpha|nematomorph worm]], Early [[Cambrian]], Chengjiang Maotianshan Shales]]\n{{further|Burgess shale type preservation}}\nThe fossils occur in a section of mudstone {{convert|50|m|ft}} thick in the [[Yuanshan Member]] of the [[Qiongzhusi Formation]]. The Yuanshan Member is extensive, covering multiple {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} of eastern Yunnan Province, where there are many scattered outcrops yielding fossils. Studies of the strata are consistent with a tropical environment with sea level changes and tectonic activity. The region is believed to have been a shallow sea with a muddy bottom. The preserved fauna is primarily [[benthic]] and was likely buried by periodic [[turbidity current]]s, since most fossils do not show evidence of post-mortem transport. Like the younger Burgess Shale fossils, the paleo-environment enabled preservation of non-mineralized, soft body parts. Fossils are found in thin layers less than an inch thick. The soft parts are preserved as aluminosilicate films, often with high oxidized iron content and often exhibiting exquisite details.\n\nThe Chengjiang beds are very deeply weathered, as evidenced by their low specific gravity (i.e., they are very lightweight).<ref name=Gaines2008>{{cite journal\n|journal=Geology\n|volume=36\n|issue=10\n|doi=10.1130/G24961A.1 \n|pages=755\u2013758\n|year=2008|title=Cambrian Burgess Shale\u2013type deposits share a common mode of fossilization\n|last1=Gaines\n|first1=Robert R.\n|last2=Briggs\n|first2=Derek E.G.\n|last3=Yuanlong\n|first3=Zhao\n|bibcode=2008Geo....36..755G\n}}</ref> Trace fossils are abundant.<ref name=\"Zhang2007\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3121.2007.00765.x | title = Diminutive trace fossils in the Chengjiang Lagerst\u00e4tte | year = 2007 | last1 = Zhang | first1 = X.

Most of those are the [[trilobite]]s (of which there are five species), all of which have been found with traces of legs, antennae, and other soft body parts, an exceedingly rare occurrence in the fossil record. Phylum [[Porifera]] (sponges; 15 species) and [[Priapulida]] (16 species) are also well represented. Other phyla represented are [[Brachiopoda]], [[Chaetognatha]], [[Cnidaria]], [[Ctenophora]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Hyolitha]], [[Nematomorpha]], [[Phoronida]], and [[Chordata]].

The most famous is ''[[Myllokunmingia]]'', possibly a very primitive agnathid (i.e., [[jawless fish]]). Similar to ''Myllokunmingia'' is ''[[Haikouichthys]] ercaicunensis'', another primitive fish-like animal.\n\nThe enigmatic ''[[Yunnanozoon|Yunnanozoon lividum]]'' is considered to be the earliest [[hemichordate]], possessing many of the characteristic chordate features and providing an anatomical link between [[invertebrates]] and chordates. ''[[Haikouella lanceolata]]'' is described to be the earliest [[craniate]]-like chordate. This fish-like animal has many similarities to ''Y. lividum'', but differs in several aspects: It has a discernible heart, dorsal and ventral aorta, gill filaments, and a [[notochord]] (neural chord).\n\nAt present, there is no agreement as to the systematic placement of the [[Vetulicola]], represented by seven species from Chengjiang. Originally described as crustacean arthropods, the Vetulicola were later erected as a new phylum of primitive [[deuterostome]]s by D.G. Shu et al. (Shu 2001). Another researcher places them with the urochordates, based on putative affinity with the Phylum Chordata. They are thought to have been swimmers that either were filter feeders or detritivores.\n\nSome two dozen animals from the Chengjiang biota are problematic regarding phylogenetic assignment. Among these, ''[[Anomalocaris]] saron'', the alleged predatory terror of the early Cambrian, is the most famous. Shu (2006) recently described ''[[Stromatoveris]] psygmoglena'' as a possible [[Bilateria|bilateran]] missing link between [[Ediacaran]] fronds and Cambrian [[ctenophore]]s. ''[[Cambrocornulitus]]'' had a tubicolous shell which probably was biomineralized.

Since then, the locality has been intensively studied by scientists throughout the world, yielding a constant flow of new discoveries and triggering an extensive scientific debate surrounding the interpretation of discoveries. Over this time, taxa have been revised or reassigned to different groups. Interpretations have led to many refinements of the [[phylogeny]] of groups and even the erection of the new phylum [[Vetulicolia]] of primitive [[deuterostomes]].\n\nThe Chengjiang biota has all the animal groups found in the Burgess Shale; however, since it is ten million years older, it more strongly supports the deduction that metazoans diversified earlier or faster in the early Cambrian than does the Burgess Shale fauna alone. The preservation of an extremely diverse faunal assemblage renders the Maotianshan shale the world's most important for understanding the evolution of early multi-cellular life, particularly the members of phylum [[Chordata]], which includes all [[vertebrates]]. The Chengjiang fossils comprise the oldest diverse [[metazoan]] assemblage above the [[Proterozoic]]-[[Phanerozoic]] transition and, thus, the [[fossil record]]'s best data source for understanding the apparently rapid diversification of life known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]].\n\n== Preservation and taphonomy ==\n[[File:Maotianshania-cylindrica.jpg|thumb|right|''Maotianshania cylindrica'', a [[fossil]] [[Nematomorpha|nematomorph worm]], Early [[Cambrian]], Chengjiang Maotianshan Shales]]\n{{further|Burgess shale type preservation}}\nThe fossils occur in a section of mudstone {{convert|50|m|ft}} thick in the [[Yuanshan Member]] of the [[Qiongzhusi Formation]]. The Yuanshan Member is extensive, covering multiple {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} of eastern Yunnan Province, where there are many scattered outcrops yielding fossils. Studies of the strata are consistent with a tropical environment with sea level changes and tectonic activity. The region is believed to have been a shallow sea with a muddy bottom. The preserved fauna is primarily [[benthic]] and was likely buried by periodic [[turbidity current]]s, since most fossils do not show evidence of post-mortem transport. Like the younger Burgess Shale fossils, the paleo-environment enabled preservation of non-mineralized, soft body parts. Fossils are found in thin layers less than an inch thick. The soft parts are preserved as aluminosilicate films, often with high oxidized iron content and often exhibiting exquisite details.\n\nThe Chengjiang beds are very deeply weathered, as evidenced by their low specific gravity (i.e., they are very lightweight).<ref name=Gaines2008>{{cite journal\n|journal=Geology\n|volume=36\n|issue=10\n|doi=10.1130/G24961A.1 \n|pages=755\u2013758\n|year=2008|title=Cambrian Burgess Shale\u2013type deposits share a common mode of fossilization\n|last1=Gaines\n|first1=Robert R.\n|last2=Briggs\n|first2=Derek E.G.\n|last3=Yuanlong\n|first3=Zhao\n|bibcode=2008Geo....36..755G\n}}</ref> Trace fossils are abundant.<ref name=\"Zhang2007\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3121.2007.00765.x | title = Diminutive trace fossils in the Chengjiang Lagerst\u00e4tte | year = 2007 | last1 = Zhang | first1 = X.

Of these, nearly half are arthropods, few of which had the hard, mineral-reinforced exoskeletons characteristic of all later arthropoda; only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang have hard shells. Most of those are the [[trilobite]]s (of which there are five species), all of which have been found with traces of legs, antennae, and other soft body parts, an exceedingly rare occurrence in the fossil record. Phylum [[Porifera]] (sponges; 15 species) and [[Priapulida]] (16 species) are also well represented. Other phyla represented are [[Brachiopoda]], [[Chaetognatha]], [[Cnidaria]], [[Ctenophora]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Hyolitha]], [[Nematomorpha]], [[Phoronida]], and [[Chordata]].

The most famous is ''[[Myllokunmingia]]'', possibly a very primitive agnathid (i.e., [[jawless fish]]). Similar to ''Myllokunmingia'' is ''[[Haikouichthys]] ercaicunensis'', another primitive fish-like animal.\n\nThe enigmatic ''[[Yunnanozoon|Yunnanozoon lividum]]'' is considered to be the earliest [[hemichordate]], possessing many of the characteristic chordate features and providing an anatomical link between [[invertebrates]] and chordates. ''[[Haikouella lanceolata]]'' is described to be the earliest [[craniate]]-like chordate. This fish-like animal has many similarities to ''Y. lividum'', but differs in several aspects: It has a discernible heart, dorsal and ventral aorta, gill filaments, and a [[notochord]] (neural chord).\n\nAt present, there is no agreement as to the systematic placement of the [[Vetulicola]], represented by seven species from Chengjiang. Originally described as crustacean arthropods, the Vetulicola were later erected as a new phylum of primitive [[deuterostome]]s by D.G. Shu et al. (Shu 2001). Another researcher places them with the urochordates, based on putative affinity with the Phylum Chordata. They are thought to have been swimmers that either were filter feeders or detritivores.\n\nSome two dozen animals from the Chengjiang biota are problematic regarding phylogenetic assignment. Among these, ''[[Anomalocaris]] saron'', the alleged predatory terror of the early Cambrian, is the most famous. Shu (2006) recently described ''[[Stromatoveris]] psygmoglena'' as a possible [[Bilateria|bilateran]] missing link between [[Ediacaran]] fronds and Cambrian [[ctenophore]]s. ''[[Cambrocornulitus]]'' had a tubicolous shell which probably was biomineralized.

It brings [[democracy|democratic values]] to education and can include [[self-determination theory|self-determination]] within a community of equals, as well as such values as justice, respect and trust. \n\nThe history of democratic education spans from at least the 1600s. While it is associated with a number of individuals, there has been no central figure, establishment, or nation that advocated democratic education.<ref>Provenzo, E.F.

In describing the teaching of children, he declares,\n\n<blockquote>None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of delight or indifferency. Let a child but be order'd to whip his top at a certain time every day, whether he has or has not a mind to it; let this be but requir'd of him as a duty, wherein he must spend so many hours morning and afternoon, and see whether he will not soon be weary of any play at this rate.<ref>Locke, John (1692) Some Thoughts Concerning Education, para 73.1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\u2019s book of advice on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education|\u00c9mile]]'', was first published in 1762. \u00c9mile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful.<ref>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1904), Emile ou l\u2019\u00e9ducation, Garnier Fr\u00e8res, Paris, page 197: \u201c. . si nous trouvons que ce travail n\u2019est bon \u00e0 rien, nous ne le reprendrons plus.\u201d</ref> He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. \u201cThe tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,\u201d<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 22 \u201cIl ne doit pas donner des pr\u00e9ceptes, il doit les faire trouver.\u201d</ref> wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make \u00c9mile learn science, but let him discover it.<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 173: \u201cQu\u2019il n\u2019apprenne pas la science, qu\u2019il l\u2019invente\u201d</ref> He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not teach us to reason; it teaches us to use other people's reasoning; it teaches us to believe a great deal but never to know anything.<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 121: \u201cSubstituer des livres \u00e0 tout cela, ce n\u2019est pas nous apprendre a nous servir de la raison d\u2019autrui; c\u2019est nous apprendre \u00e0 beaucoup croire, et \u00e0 ne jamais rien savoir</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nWhile Locke and Rousseau were concerned only with the education of the children of the wealthy, in the 19th century [[Leo Tolstoy]] set up a school for peasant children. This was on his own estate at [[Yasnaya Polyana]], Russia, in the late 19th century. He tells us that the school evolved freely from principles introduced by teachers and pupils; that in spite of the preponderating influence of the teacher, the pupil had always had the right not to come to school, or, having come, not to listen to the teacher, and that the teacher had the right not to admit a pupil, and was able to use all the influence he could muster to win over the community, where the children were always in the majority.<ref>Tolstoy, Leo, in \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\" in ''Tolstoy on Education'', translated by Leo Wiener (1967), University of Chicago Press, page 233</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smmnsej/tolstoy/chap4.htm|title=3.

The skills or knowledge learned in one process are not generalizable nor reliably transferred to other areas of human action. Her primary focus was on mathematics in context and mathematics education.\n\nThe broader implications reached by Lave and others who specialize in [[situated learning]] are that beyond the argument that certain knowledge is necessary to be a member of society (a Durkheimian argument), knowledge learned in the context of a school is not reliably transferable to other contexts of practice.\n\nJohn Locke argues that children are capable of reasoning at a young age:  \u201cIt will perhaps be wonder\u2019d, that I mention reasoning with children; and yet I cannot but think that the true way of dealing with them.

Claus Offe and Ulrich Preuss, two theorists of the political culture of deliberative democracies argue that in its cultural production deliberative democracy requires \u201can open-ended and continuous learning process in which the roles of both \u2018teacher\u2019 and \u2018curriculum\u2019 are missing. In other words, what is to be learned is a matter that we must settle in the process of learning itself.\"<ref>Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. \u201cDemocratic Institutions and Moral Resources\u201d \u201cPolitical Theory Today.\u201d David Held, ed.

(1987) p 99.</ref>\n\n====Preparation for life in a democracy====\n\nThe \"strongest, political rationale\" for democratic education is that it teaches \"the virtues of democratic deliberation for the sake of future citizenship.\"<ref>Curren, R. (2007) ''Philosophy of Education: An Anthology.''

Although there was a resurgence of inquiry education in the 1980s and 1990s <ref>Kathy Short, Jerome Harste, and Carolyn Burke 1996, \"Creating Classrooms for Authors and Inquirers, 2nd edition\", Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann</ref> the standards movement of the 21st century and the attendant school reform movement have squashed most attempts at authentic inquiry-oriented democratic education practices.

This is easier to accomplish in elementary school settings than in secondary school settings, as elementary teachers typically teach all subjects and have large blocks of time that allow for in-depth projects that integrate curriculum from different knowledge domains.\n\nAllen Koshewa <ref>Allen Koshewa 1999, \"Discipline and Democracy: Teachers on Trial\" Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann</ref> conducted research that highlighted the tensions between democratic education and the role of teacher control, showing that children in a fifth grade classroom tried to usurp democratic practices by using undue influence to sway others, much as representative democracies often fail to focus on the common good or protect minority interests. He found that class meetings, service education, saturation in the arts, and an emphasis on interpersonal caring helped overcome some of these challenges. Despite the challenges of inquiry education, classrooms that allow students to make choices about curriculum propel students to not only learn about democracy but also to experience it.\n\n==Democratic education in practice==\n\n===Play===\nA striking feature of democratic schools is the ubiquity of [[Play (activity)|play]]. Students of all ages\u2014but especially the younger ones\u2014often spend most of their time either in free play, or playing [[game]]s ([[video game|electronic]] or otherwise). All attempts to limit, control or direct play must be democratically approved before being implemented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/424/kid-politics|title=Kid Politics|website=thisamericanlife.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> Play is seen as activity every bit as worthy as academic pursuits, often even more valuable.

It brings [[democracy|democratic values]] to education and can include [[self-determination theory|self-determination]] within a community of equals, as well as such values as justice, respect and trust. \n\nThe history of democratic education spans from at least the 1600s. While it is associated with a number of individuals, there has been no central figure, establishment, or nation that advocated democratic education.<ref>Provenzo, E.F.

In describing the teaching of children, he declares,\n\n<blockquote>None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of delight or indifferency. Let a child but be order'd to whip his top at a certain time every day, whether he has or has not a mind to it; let this be but requir'd of him as a duty, wherein he must spend so many hours morning and afternoon, and see whether he will not soon be weary of any play at this rate.<ref>Locke, John (1692) Some Thoughts Concerning Education, para 73.1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\u2019s book of advice on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education|\u00c9mile]]'', was first published in 1762. \u00c9mile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful.<ref>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1904), Emile ou l\u2019\u00e9ducation, Garnier Fr\u00e8res, Paris, page 197: \u201c. . si nous trouvons que ce travail n\u2019est bon \u00e0 rien, nous ne le reprendrons plus.\u201d</ref> He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. \u201cThe tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,\u201d<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 22 \u201cIl ne doit pas donner des pr\u00e9ceptes, il doit les faire trouver.\u201d</ref> wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make \u00c9mile learn science, but let him discover it.<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 173: \u201cQu\u2019il n\u2019apprenne pas la science, qu\u2019il l\u2019invente\u201d</ref> He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not teach us to reason; it teaches us to use other people's reasoning; it teaches us to believe a great deal but never to know anything.<ref>Rousseau 1904, page 121: \u201cSubstituer des livres \u00e0 tout cela, ce n\u2019est pas nous apprendre a nous servir de la raison d\u2019autrui; c\u2019est nous apprendre \u00e0 beaucoup croire, et \u00e0 ne jamais rien savoir</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nWhile Locke and Rousseau were concerned only with the education of the children of the wealthy, in the 19th century [[Leo Tolstoy]] set up a school for peasant children. This was on his own estate at [[Yasnaya Polyana]], Russia, in the late 19th century. He tells us that the school evolved freely from principles introduced by teachers and pupils; that in spite of the preponderating influence of the teacher, the pupil had always had the right not to come to school, or, having come, not to listen to the teacher, and that the teacher had the right not to admit a pupil, and was able to use all the influence he could muster to win over the community, where the children were always in the majority.<ref>Tolstoy, Leo, in \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\" in ''Tolstoy on Education'', translated by Leo Wiener (1967), University of Chicago Press, page 233</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smmnsej/tolstoy/chap4.htm|title=3.

Democratic schools have no mandatory curriculum, considering forced learning to be undemocratic.

The skills or knowledge learned in one process are not generalizable nor reliably transferred to other areas of human action. Her primary focus was on mathematics in context and mathematics education.\n\nThe broader implications reached by Lave and others who specialize in [[situated learning]] are that beyond the argument that certain knowledge is necessary to be a member of society (a Durkheimian argument), knowledge learned in the context of a school is not reliably transferable to other contexts of practice.\n\nJohn Locke argues that children are capable of reasoning at a young age:  \u201cIt will perhaps be wonder\u2019d, that I mention reasoning with children; and yet I cannot but think that the true way of dealing with them.

Claus Offe and Ulrich Preuss, two theorists of the political culture of deliberative democracies argue that in its cultural production deliberative democracy requires \u201can open-ended and continuous learning process in which the roles of both \u2018teacher\u2019 and \u2018curriculum\u2019 are missing. In other words, what is to be learned is a matter that we must settle in the process of learning itself.\"<ref>Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. \u201cDemocratic Institutions and Moral Resources\u201d \u201cPolitical Theory Today.\u201d David Held, ed.

(1987) p 99.</ref>\n\n====Preparation for life in a democracy====\n\nThe \"strongest, political rationale\" for democratic education is that it teaches \"the virtues of democratic deliberation for the sake of future citizenship.\"<ref>Curren, R. (2007) ''Philosophy of Education: An Anthology.''

Although there was a resurgence of inquiry education in the 1980s and 1990s <ref>Kathy Short, Jerome Harste, and Carolyn Burke 1996, \"Creating Classrooms for Authors and Inquirers, 2nd edition\", Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann</ref> the standards movement of the 21st century and the attendant school reform movement have squashed most attempts at authentic inquiry-oriented democratic education practices.

This is easier to accomplish in elementary school settings than in secondary school settings, as elementary teachers typically teach all subjects and have large blocks of time that allow for in-depth projects that integrate curriculum from different knowledge domains.\n\nAllen Koshewa <ref>Allen Koshewa 1999, \"Discipline and Democracy: Teachers on Trial\" Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann</ref> conducted research that highlighted the tensions between democratic education and the role of teacher control, showing that children in a fifth grade classroom tried to usurp democratic practices by using undue influence to sway others, much as representative democracies often fail to focus on the common good or protect minority interests. He found that class meetings, service education, saturation in the arts, and an emphasis on interpersonal caring helped overcome some of these challenges. Despite the challenges of inquiry education, classrooms that allow students to make choices about curriculum propel students to not only learn about democracy but also to experience it.\n\n==Democratic education in practice==\n\n===Play===\nA striking feature of democratic schools is the ubiquity of [[Play (activity)|play]]. Students of all ages\u2014but especially the younger ones\u2014often spend most of their time either in free play, or playing [[game]]s ([[video game|electronic]] or otherwise). All attempts to limit, control or direct play must be democratically approved before being implemented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/424/kid-politics|title=Kid Politics|website=thisamericanlife.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> Play is seen as activity every bit as worthy as academic pursuits, often even more valuable.

Bathiudeen then mentioned the suspect's father and asked what can be done to which the army commander replied asking him to call back in one and a half years as he has the authority to detain him that long. Further a house belonging to his sister was rented out to the terrorists to which Bathiudeen stated that his sister was in Canada. Further he denied that his brother had any business dealings with the father of the bombers and also stated that the IDB under him provided materials to the terrorists legally as they provide materials to small and medium enterprises and did not know their use. As a result of the allegations members of the Joint Opposition signed a No Confidence Motion against Bathiudeen consisting of 10 charges including the arrest of Abdul Hanuth who was a secretary to Bathiudeen and a Maulavi who was an advisor to Bathiudeen.

According to the Army Commander [[Mahesh Senanayake]],  Bathiudeen called him three times first to confirm if a person was arrested and after ignoring him twice the commander confirmed that the person was arrested. Bathiudeen then mentioned the suspect's father and asked what can be done to which the army commander replied asking him to call back in one and a half years as he has the authority to detain him that long. Further a house belonging to his sister was rented out to the terrorists to which Bathiudeen stated that his sister was in Canada. Further he denied that his brother had any business dealings with the father of the bombers and also stated that the IDB under him provided materials to the terrorists legally as they provide materials to small and medium enterprises and did not know their use. As a result of the allegations members of the Joint Opposition signed a No Confidence Motion against Bathiudeen consisting of 10 charges including the arrest of Abdul Hanuth who was a secretary to Bathiudeen and a Maulavi who was an advisor to Bathiudeen. Further it also accused him of influencing the police not to arrest suspects under Prevention of Terrorism Act allowing them to be give bail on 6 May 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Minister-Bathiudeen-made-a-request:-Army-Chief/108-167334|title=Minister Bathiudeen made a request: Army Chief|website=www.dailymirror.lk|language=English|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19A/May16_1557990298CH.php|title=Sri Lanka : No-Confidence motion against Minister Bathiudeen handed over to Speaker|website=www.colombopage.com|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19A/May11_1557546051CH.php|title=Sri Lanka : Sri Lanka Minister says he is being falsely accused following the terror attacks|website=www.colombopage.com|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news/55184/ten-charges-levelled-against-rishad-in-no-confidence-motion|website=www.adaderana.lk|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May [[Athuraliye Rathana Thero|Athuraliye Rathana]] Thera began a hunger protest requesting the removal of Muslim politicians with alleged ties to Islamists including Rishad Bathiudeen and [[Mahamood Lebbe Alim Hizbullah|Hizbullah]].

There is a waterfall and a pound using ground water generated in the nearby subway. In the surrounding area, wetland plants, weevils, buttercups, and water buffalo were planted in order to improve water quality and to adapt to the natural environment.\n\n====Gangseo wetland====\nThe Gangseo wetland (Korean:\uac15\uc11c\uc2b5\uc9c0) is a wetland ecological park where fish, amphibians, water birds, plants, and tidal aquaculture can inhabit and be reproduced. It was established by planting plants such as wet plants, aquatic plants, and herbaceous plants in the wetland downstream of the Han River. Gangseo wetland provides citizens with opportunities to observe ecosystems and to learn about environment and nature.\n\n====Godeok riverside====\nThe Godeok riverside (Korean:\uace0\ub355\uc218\ubcc0) was made by planting trees and herbaceous plants on the idle land of the Gokdong district, the upper stream of the Han River. With nearby forest terrains, the Godeok riverside contributes to the increase of ecological diversity and the conservation of the ecosystem. It also provides the place for leisure and ecological experience.\n\n====Nanji wetland====\nThe Nanji wetland (Korean:\ub09c\uc9c0\uc2b5\uc9c0) was created by one of the operations of the Hangang Municipal Park Nanji Area Specialization Project. An ecological wetland of 57,600 square meters was created by efforts to inflow the water of Hangang where before, the wetland could not do its role except in the rainy seosons. Nanji wetland actively introduces citizen participation activity to restore the ecosystem of Hangang and to aim an environmental city, coexisting with nature. It also plays the role of a site for ecological learning.\n\n====Amsa waterfront(Korean:\uc554\uc0ac\ub454\uce58)====\nThe artificial shore and bicycle road of the Amsa-dong riverside was demolished, and an ecological park with wildflowers, walking trails, a community of reeds and mussels was created to expand the habitat of livings and to improve the view of the scene.<ref>http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1131921</ref>\n\n===Fish road===\nTo restore and balance the ecosystem, Fish roads were made on the Hangang Park. Fish roads became a major tourist attraction, carrying out both roles of education and tourism.\n\nThe existing fish road, north to the Jamsil underwater reservoir, caused ecological unbalance due to disconnection between the upstream and downstream ecosystem. In order to restore and balance the Aquatic ecosystem of Hangang, a new fish road was constructed south to the reservoir. According to investigation, a total of 3,675 animals of 33 species are using the new fish road. 31 of the 33 species are pisces, while the other 2 are crustacea. Also, 7 of the 33 species(''[[Acheilognathus yamatsutae]]'', ''[[Acheilognathus gracilis]]'', ''Sarcocheilichthys variegatus wakiyae'', ''Sarcocheilichthys nigripinnis morii'', ''Squalidus gracilis majimae'', ''Squalidus japonicus coreanus'', ''Microphysogobio jeoni'') are native only to Korea. Also, 3 migratory fish species(''[[Smelt (fish)|Smelt]]'', ''[[Ayu]]'', ''Gymnogobius urotaenia'') are using the fish road. Especially, the smelts had eggs when discovered, which means that the fish road did an important part in the migratory species' movement for laying eggs.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Hangang Park View 201604.jpg|Lawn and water feature in Yeouido Hangang Park\nFile:Hangang Park Cycling Path 201604.jpg|Cycling Path and restaurant in Yeouido Hangang Park\nFile:Hangang Park Plaza 201604.jpg|Plaza in Yeouido Hangang Park\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]\n* [[Yeouido]]\n* [[Yeouido Park]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/}}\n* [http://english.seoul.go.kr/life-information/natural-attractions-parks/hangang/00-parks-hangang-river/ Explanations of each park of Hangang Park by Seoul Metropolitan Government]\n* [https://www.hanwhafireworks.com/home.jsp Hanwha Seoul International Fireworks Festival 2017]\n* [http://english.seoul.go.kr/life-information/culture/festivals-seoul-2/2017-hangang-river-summer-festivals/ Hangang Summer Festival(English)]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2014 Hangang Summer Festival 2014]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2015 Hangang Summer Festival 2015]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2016 Hangang Summer Festival 2016]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2017 Hangang Summer Festival 2017]\n{{Seoul parks}}\n\n{{coord missing|South Korea}}\n\n[[Category:Han River (Korea)]]\n[[Category:Parks in Seoul]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Seoul]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Seoul]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Korean name\n|hangul= \ud55c\uac15\uacf5\uc6d0\n|hanja= \u6f22\u6c5f\u516c\u5712\n|rr= Han-gang Gongwon\n|mr= Han'gang Kongw\u014fn\n|image   = Hangang Park Overview 201604.jpg\n|caption = view of Yeouido Hangang Park (2016)\n}}\n[[File:Hangang Yeouido Spring Flower Festival (4403576688).jpg|thumb|250px|Yeouido Hangang Park during spring]]\n'''Hangang Park''' (Korean: \ud55c\uac15\uacf5\uc6d0) is a park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].

There is a waterfall and a pound using ground water generated in the nearby subway. In the surrounding area, wetland plants, weevils, buttercups, and water buffalo were planted in order to improve water quality and to adapt to the natural environment.\n\n====Gangseo wetland====\nThe Gangseo wetland (Korean:\uac15\uc11c\uc2b5\uc9c0) is a wetland ecological park where fish, amphibians, water birds, plants, and tidal aquaculture can inhabit and be reproduced. It was established by planting plants such as wet plants, aquatic plants, and herbaceous plants in the wetland downstream of the Han River. Gangseo wetland provides citizens with opportunities to observe ecosystems and to learn about environment and nature.\n\n====Godeok riverside====\nThe Godeok riverside (Korean:\uace0\ub355\uc218\ubcc0) was made by planting trees and herbaceous plants on the idle land of the Gokdong district, the upper stream of the Han River. With nearby forest terrains, the Godeok riverside contributes to the increase of ecological diversity and the conservation of the ecosystem. It also provides the place for leisure and ecological experience.\n\n====Nanji wetland====\nThe Nanji wetland (Korean:\ub09c\uc9c0\uc2b5\uc9c0) was created by one of the operations of the Hangang Municipal Park Nanji Area Specialization Project. An ecological wetland of 57,600 square meters was created by efforts to inflow the water of Hangang where before, the wetland could not do its role except in the rainy seosons. Nanji wetland actively introduces citizen participation activity to restore the ecosystem of Hangang and to aim an environmental city, coexisting with nature. It also plays the role of a site for ecological learning.\n\n====Amsa waterfront(Korean:\uc554\uc0ac\ub454\uce58)====\nThe artificial shore and bicycle road of the Amsa-dong riverside was demolished, and an ecological park with wildflowers, walking trails, a community of reeds and mussels was created to expand the habitat of livings and to improve the view of the scene.<ref>http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1131921</ref>\n\n===Fish road===\nTo restore and balance the ecosystem, Fish roads were made on the Hangang Park. Fish roads became a major tourist attraction, carrying out both roles of education and tourism.\n\nThe existing fish road, north to the Jamsil underwater reservoir, caused ecological unbalance due to disconnection between the upstream and downstream ecosystem. In order to restore and balance the Aquatic ecosystem of Hangang, a new fish road was constructed south to the reservoir. According to investigation, a total of 3,675 animals of 33 species are using the new fish road. 31 of the 33 species are pisces, while the other 2 are crustacea. Also, 7 of the 33 species(''[[Acheilognathus yamatsutae]]'', ''[[Acheilognathus gracilis]]'', ''Sarcocheilichthys variegatus wakiyae'', ''Sarcocheilichthys nigripinnis morii'', ''Squalidus gracilis majimae'', ''Squalidus japonicus coreanus'', ''Microphysogobio jeoni'') are native only to Korea. Also, 3 migratory fish species(''[[Smelt (fish)|Smelt]]'', ''[[Ayu]]'', ''Gymnogobius urotaenia'') are using the fish road. Especially, the smelts had eggs when discovered, which means that the fish road did an important part in the migratory species' movement for laying eggs.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Hangang Park View 201604.jpg|Lawn and water feature in Yeouido Hangang Park\nFile:Hangang Park Cycling Path 201604.jpg|Cycling Path and restaurant in Yeouido Hangang Park\nFile:Hangang Park Plaza 201604.jpg|Plaza in Yeouido Hangang Park\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]\n* [[Yeouido]]\n* [[Yeouido Park]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/}}\n* [http://english.seoul.go.kr/life-information/natural-attractions-parks/hangang/00-parks-hangang-river/ Explanations of each park of Hangang Park by Seoul Metropolitan Government]\n* [https://www.hanwhafireworks.com/home.jsp Hanwha Seoul International Fireworks Festival 2017]\n* [http://english.seoul.go.kr/life-information/culture/festivals-seoul-2/2017-hangang-river-summer-festivals/ Hangang Summer Festival(English)]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2014 Hangang Summer Festival 2014]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2015 Hangang Summer Festival 2015]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2016 Hangang Summer Festival 2016]\n* [http://hangang.seoul.go.kr/project2017 Hangang Summer Festival 2017]\n{{Seoul parks}}\n\n{{coord missing|South Korea}}\n\n[[Category:Han River (Korea)]]\n[[Category:Parks in Seoul]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Seoul]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Seoul]]\n", "name_user": "Celine SAYUL", "label": "safe", "comment": "added Korean translation of 63 building.

In the decades since its establishment, the association is recognized as a leading advocate for producers of domestic oil and gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.usoga.org/en/about_us/history/|title=A Brief History|publisher=usoga.org|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOver the city's history many large oil companies have been headquartered in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with [[Gulf Oil]] in what was then the largest merger in the energy industry), [[Skelly Oil]], [[Getty Oil]] and [[CITGO]].
