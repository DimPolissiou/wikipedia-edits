Please do not add sub-genres without discussion there.--> adapted, produced, and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on [[psychiatry]], [[juvenile delinquency]], youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.\n\n[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent <!-- See section below #Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel for discussion about last name -->whose interests include [[classical music]] (especially [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), committing rape, theft and what is termed \"ultra-violence\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete ([[Michael Tarn]]), Georgie ([[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]]), and Dim ([[Warren Clarke]]), whom he calls his ''droogs'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior ([[Anthony Sharp]]). Alex narrates most of the film in [[Nadsat]], a fractured adolescent slang composed of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (especially Russian), English, and [[Cockney rhyming slang]].\n\n[[A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)|The soundtrack to ''A Clockwork Orange'']] features mostly classical music selections and [[Moog synthesizer]] compositions by [[Wendy Carlos]]. The artwork for the poster of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was created by [[Philip Castle]] with the layout by designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per Film project guidelines, please keep this plot section between 400 and 700 words long. -->\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer F. Alexander and beat him to the point of crippling him for life. Alex then rapes Alexander's wife while singing [[Singin' in the Rain (song)|\"Singin' in the Rain\"]]. The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer P. R. Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning him and leaving him to be arrested. With Alex in custody, Deltoid gloats that the cat-lady died, making Alex a murderer. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental [[aversion therapy]] for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is let out as a free man, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him up, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Alexander, where he is being cared for by Alexander's manservant, Julian. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of Alex and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted him and his wife. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by throwing himself out the window.\n\nAlex wakes up in a hospital with broken bones. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth.

It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.}}\nAfter aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, though not through choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange\u2014organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. After Alex has undergone the Ludovico technique, the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false, arguing that true goodness ''must'' come from within. This leads to the theme of abusing liberties\u2014personal, governmental, civil\u2014by Alex, with two conflicting political forces, the Government and the Dissidents, both manipulating Alex purely for their own political ends.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Books of The Times |date=19 March 1963 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202042027/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The story portrays the \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" parties as equally worthy of criticism: the writer Frank Alexander, a victim of Alex and his gang, wants revenge against Alex ''and'' sees him as a means of definitively turning the populace against the incumbent government and its new regime. Mr Alexander fears the new government; in a telephone conversation, he says:\n{{Cquote|Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of [[totalitarianism]].}}\n\nOn the other side, the Minister of the Interior (the Government) jails Mr Alexander (the Dissident Intellectual) on the excuse of his endangering Alex (the People), rather than the government's totalitarian regime (described by Mr Alexander). It is unclear whether or not he has been harmed; however, the Minister tells Alex that the writer has been denied the ability to write and produce \"subversive\" material that is critical of the incumbent government and meant to provoke political unrest.\n\n===Psychology===\n[[File:LudovicoMalcolmMcDowellAClockworkOrangetrailer.png|thumb|Ludovico technique apparatus]]\nAnother target of criticism is the [[behaviourism]] or \"behavioural psychology\" propounded by psychologists [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' (1971) \"one of the most dangerous books ever written\". Although behaviourism's limitations were conceded by its principal founder, Watson, Skinner argued that [[behaviour modification]]\u2014specifically, [[operant conditioning]] (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the [[Classical conditioning|\"classical\" Watsonian conditioning]]\u2014is the key to an ideal society. The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived as a parody of [[aversion therapy]], which is a form of classical conditioning.<ref>{{cite web |author=Theodore Dalrymple |title=A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html |work=City Journal |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170544/http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | archive-date=1 February 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Paul Duncan said of Alex: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images. The implication is that all of the images, both real and imagined, are part of Alex's fantasies\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=142}} Psychiatrist Aaron Stern, the former head of the MPAA rating board, believed that Alex represents man in his natural state, the unconscious mind. Alex becomes \"civilised\" after receiving his Ludovico \"cure\" and the sickness in the aftermath Stern considered to be the \"neurosis imposed by society\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=128}} Kubrick told film critics Philip Strick and [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]] that he believed Alex \"makes no attempt to deceive himself or the audience as to his total corruption or wickedness.

On the other hand, he has winning qualities: his total candour, his wit, his intelligence and his energy; these are attractive qualities and ones, which I might add, which he shares with [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=129}}\n\n==Production==\nMcDowell was chosen for the role of Alex after Kubrick saw him in the film ''[[if....]]'' (1968).

Sound: 225,880 feet printed from 288 1/4\" reel to reel tapes.\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe cinematic adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1962) was not initially planned. [[Screenwriter|Screenplay writer]] [[Terry Southern]] gave Kubrick a copy of the novel, but, as he was developing a [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]-related project, Kubrick put it aside. Kubrick's wife, in an interview, stated she then gave him the novel after having read it. It had an immediate impact. Of his enthusiasm for it, Kubrick said, \"I was excited by everything about it: the plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level.\" Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, \"I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The ACO Controversy in the UK |website=Visual-memory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTHAmrtn?url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which omitted the final chapter.\n\n====Novelist's response====\nBurgess had mixed feelings about the film adaptation of his novel, publicly saying he loved [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]], and the use of music; he praised it as \"brilliant\", even so brilliant that it might be dangerous. Despite this enthusiasm, he was concerned that it lacked the novel's [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter|redemptive final chapter]], an absence he blamed upon his American publisher and not Kubrick. All US editions of the novel prior to 1986 omitted the final chapter.\n\nBurgess reports in his autobiography ''You've Had Your Time''&nbsp;(1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's novel ''[[Napoleon Symphony]]'' (1974) was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A [[lapsed Catholic]], Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organisations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf. Despite the benefits Burgess made from the film, he was in no way involved in the production of the book's adaptation. The only profit he made directly from the film was the initial $500 that was given to him for the rights to the adaptation.\n\n===Direction===\nKubrick was a perfectionist who researched meticulously, with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations, as well as many scene takes; however, per Malcolm McDowell, he usually \"got it right\" early on, so there were few takes. So meticulous was Kubrick that McDowell stated \"If Kubrick hadn't been a film director he'd have been a General Chief of Staff of the US Forces. No matter what it is\u2014even if it's a question of buying a shampoo it goes through him. He just likes total control.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=6-7}} Filming took place between September 1970 and April 1971, making ''A Clockwork Orange'' the quickest film shoot in his career.

The teenage slang has a heavily Russian influence, as in the novel; Burgess explains the slang as being, in part, intended to draw a reader into the world of the book's characters and to prevent the book from becoming outdated. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one, or perhaps a society evolving from a failed socialism into a fully authoritarian society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and in the film, there is a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed municipal architecture, and the name \"Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North\" alludes to socialist-style housing.<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \">[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417145347/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |date=17 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the film, when the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to exactly what kind of society it is. Kubrick asserted that the film held comparisons between both the left and right end of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated, \"The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left... They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.\"<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \"/>\n\n===Locations===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Thamesmead Housing Estate 01.jpg|thumb|Thamesmead South Housing Estate where Alex knocks his rebellious droogs into the lake in a sudden surprise attack]]\n''A Clockwork Orange'' was photographed mostly [[Filming location|on location]] in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]].\n\nShooting began on 7 September 1970 with call sheet no. 1 at the Duke Of New York pub: an unused scene and the first of many unused locations. A few days later, shooting commenced in Alex's Ludovico treatment bedroom and the [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|Serum 114]] injection by Dr Branom.\n\nNew Year's Eve started with rehearsals at the Korova Milk Bar and shooting finished after four continuous days on 8 January.\n\nThe last scenes were shot in February 1971, ending with call sheet no. 113. The last main scene to be filmed was Alex's fight with Billy Boy's gang, which took six days to cover. Shooting encompassed a total of around 113 days over six months of fairly continuous shooting. As is normal practice, there was no attempt to shoot the script in chronological order.\n\nThe few scenes not shot on location were the Korova Milk Bar, the prison check-in area, Alex having a bath at F. Alexander's house, and two corresponding scenes in the hallway. These sets were built at an old factory on Bullhead Road, [[Borehamwood]], which also served as the production office. Seven call sheets are missing from the Stanley Kubrick Archive, so some locations, such as the hallway, cannot be confirmed.\n\nOtherwise, locations used in the film include:\n* The attack on the tramp was filmed at the (since renovated) pedestrian underpass under York Road Roundabout at the southern end of [[Wandsworth Bridge]], [[Wandsworth|Wandsworth, London]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |last=Zicari |first=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |website=|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The unused scene of the attack on the professor was shot in [[Friars Square]] shopping centre in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, (then open, since covered) but dropped due to the actor dying.

This is 200 yards north of Tavy Bridge precinct, where Alex walks home at night through an elevated plaza whistling and kicking rubbish. \n* The \"Duke Of New York\" pub is the since-demolished \"The Bottle and Dragon\" pub (formerly \"The Old Leather Bottle\") in [[Stonegrove estate|Stonegrove]], Edgware, London.\n* The Cat Lady house where Alex is caught by police is [[Manor Lodge School|Shenley Lodge]], Rectory Lane, Shenley, Hertfordshire.\n* The prison's exterior is [[HMP Wandsworth]], its interior is the [[Royal Artillery Barracks|Woolwich Barracks]]' since-demolished prison wing, Woolwich, London.\n* The chapel in which Alex scrolls the lyrics as the prisoners sing is a since-demolished lecture room at St. Edward's College, Totteridge Lane, North London. The library where he reads, fantasizes and then discusses the Ludovico Treatment with the priest was underneath the lecture room. The prison governor's office, where Alex signs consent for the Ludovico treatment, is on the same site (still standing).\n* The two biblical fantasy scenes (Christ and the fight scene) were filmed at Dashwood Mausoleum, [[West Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire.\n* The check-in at Ludovico Medical Clinic, the brain-washing film theatre, Alex's apartment block lobby with the broken elevator, Alex's hospital bedroom and police interrogation/beating room (since demolished) are all at [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]], Uxbridge, Middlesex.\n* The Minister's presentation to the media of Alex's \"cure\" takes place at the Nettlefold Hall inside West Norwood Library, [[West Norwood]], London.\n* Alex is attacked by vagrants underneath the north side of the [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]], Chelsea, London.\n* The scene where Dim and Georgie take Alex down the country lane in the police [[Land Rover]] and subsequent water trough beating is School Lane, Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire.\n* Alex's suicide bid leap and corresponding billiard room were at the old Edgwarebury Country Club, Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]], Hertfordshire.\n* The hospital in which Alex recovers is [[Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow|Princess Alexandra Hospital]], in [[Harlow]], Essex.\n* The final sexual fantasy was shot at the since-demolished [[Handley Page]] Ltd's hangars, [[Radlett]], Hertfordshire.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)}}\n\nDespite Alex's obsession with Beethoven, the soundtrack contains more music by [[Rossini]] than by Beethoven. The fast-motion sex scene with the two girls, the slow-motion fight between Alex and his Droogs, the fight with Billy Boy's gang, the drive to the writer's home (\"playing 'hogs of the road'\"), the invasion of the Cat Lady's home, and the scene where Alex looks into the river and contemplates suicide before being approached by the beggar are all accompanied by Rossini's music.<ref>''Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange''\n edited by Stuart Y.

While the film ends with Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with Alex's positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay on the novel's American edition, in which the final chapter had been deleted on the insistence of its American publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |website=Visual-memory.co.uk| access-date=1 May 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21| archive-date=18 August 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> He claimed not to have read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of ''A Clockwork Orange'' says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.\n* In the novel, Alex's last name was never revealed, while in the film, his surname is 'DeLarge', due to Alex's calling himself \"Alexander the Large\" in the novel.\n* At the beginning of the novel, Alex is a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. In the film, to lessen the controversy, Alex is portrayed as somewhat older, around 17 or 18.\n* Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a shambolic state of desperation, whereas the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<ref>Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed by Randy Rasmussen, p. 112</ref><br />One example of this would be differences in the portrayal of P. R. Deltoid, Alex's \"post-corrective advisor\". In the novel, P. R. Deltoid appears to have some [[moral authority]] (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime, despite his protests). In the film, Deltoid is slightly sadistic and seems to have a sexual interest in Alex, interviewing him in his parents' bedroom and smacking him in the crotch.\n* In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel.<ref>Stanley Kubrick by John Baxter, p. 255</ref>\n* In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through a number of careless references to the previous attack (e.g., his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too \"stiff\".<ref>Stanley Kubrick by Vincent LoBrutto pp. 365\u20136 and Stanley Kubrick, director by Alexander Walker, Sybil Taylor, Ulrich Ruchti, p. 204</ref>\n* In the novel, Alex is offered up for treatment after killing a fellow inmate who was sexually harassing him. In the film, this scene was cut out and, instead of Alex practically volunteering for the procedure, he was simply selected by the Interior Minister for speaking up during a ministerial inspection of the prison.\n* Alex's prison number in the novel is 6655321. His prison number in the film is 655321.\n* In the novel, Alex drugs and rapes two 10-year-old girls. In the film, the girls are young adults who seem to have consensual, playful sex with him, with no suggestion of using any drugs and without any violence.\n* In the novel, the writer was working on a manuscript called ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his gang are breaking into his house. In the movie, the title of the manuscript is not visible, leaving no literal reference to the title of the movie. Some explanations of the title are offered in the [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Title|Analysis]] section of the novel.\n* Early in both the novel and the film, Alex and his droogs brutally attack a drunk, homeless man. Later, when Alex is returned to society, he is recognised by the same man. The homeless man gathers several other homeless men to beat Alex, who is unable to defend himself. These later scenes do not appear in the book. After Alex is returned to society, he decides he wants to kill himself and goes to a library to find a book on how to do it. There, he is recognised by the man he had beaten and is attacked by him and a gang of other old library patrons.\n* Alex is beaten nearly to death by the police after his rehabilitation. In the film, the policemen are two of his former droogs, Dim and Georgie. In the book, instead of Georgie, who was said to have been killed, the second officer is Billyboy, the leader of the opposing gang whom Alex and his droogs fought earlier, both in the film and the book.\n* The film concludes with Alex recovering from his suicide attempt in hospital. In the novel, Alex leaves the hospital and forms a new band of droogs, but is unsatisfied by the violent activities which once entertained him. He encounters Peter (one of his former droogs) in a caf\u00e9, and is fascinated by the seemingly nonviolent life he now leads. The story closes with Alex suggesting that he might try to pursue a similar, peaceful lifestyle.\n* In the novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all music, but in the film he is only conditioned against [[Beethoven's 9th Symphony]].\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2000, the film was released on VHS and [[DVD]], both individually and as part of ''The Stanley Kubrick Collection'' DVD set. Due to negative comments from fans, Warner Bros re-released the film, its image digitally restored and its soundtrack remastered. A limited-edition collector's set with a soundtrack disc, film poster, booklet and film strip followed, but later was discontinued. In 2005, a British re-release, packaged as an \"Iconic Film\" in a limited-edition slipcase was published, identical to the remastered DVD set, except for different package cover art. In 2006, Warner Bros announced the September publication of a two-disc special edition featuring a Malcolm McDowell commentary, and the releases of other two-disc sets of Stanley Kubrick films. Several British retailers had set the release date as 6 November 2006; the release was delayed and re-announced for 2007 Holiday Season.\n\nAn [[HD DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and DVD re-release version of the film was released on 23 October 2007. The release accompanies four other Kubrick classics. 1080p video transfers and remixed Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (for HD DVD) and uncompressed 5.1 PCM (for Blu-ray) audio tracks are on both the Blu-ray and HD DVD editions. Unlike the previous version, the DVD re-release edition is anamorphically enhanced. The Blu-ray was reissued for the 40th anniversary of the film's release, identical to the previously released Blu-ray, apart from adding a Digibook and the ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'' documentary as a bonus feature.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlong with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), the film is considered a landmark in the relaxation of control on violence in the cinema.<ref>Ian MacDonald, ''Revolution in the Head'', Pimlico, p.235</ref>\n\n''A Clockwork Orange'' remains an influential work in cinema and other media.

Please do not add sub-genres without discussion there.--> adapted, produced, and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on [[psychiatry]], [[juvenile delinquency]], youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.\n\n[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent <!-- See section below #Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel for discussion about last name -->whose interests include [[classical music]] (especially [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), committing rape, theft and what is termed \"ultra-violence\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete ([[Michael Tarn]]), Georgie ([[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]]), and Dim ([[Warren Clarke]]), whom he calls his ''droogs'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior ([[Anthony Sharp]]). Alex narrates most of the film in [[Nadsat]], a fractured adolescent slang composed of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (especially Russian), English, and [[Cockney rhyming slang]].\n\n[[A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)|The soundtrack to ''A Clockwork Orange'']] features mostly classical music selections and [[Moog synthesizer]] compositions by [[Wendy Carlos]]. The artwork for the poster of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was created by [[Philip Castle]] with the layout by designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per Film project guidelines, please keep this plot section between 400 and 700 words long. -->\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer F. Alexander and beat him to the point of crippling him for life. Alex then rapes Alexander's wife while singing [[Singin' in the Rain (song)|\"Singin' in the Rain\"]]. The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer P. R. Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning him and leaving him to be arrested. With Alex in custody, Deltoid gloats that the cat-lady died, making Alex a murderer. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental [[aversion therapy]] for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is let out as a free man, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him up, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Alexander, where he is being cared for by Alexander's manservant, Julian. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of Alex and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted him and his wife. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by throwing himself out the window.\n\nAlex wakes up in a hospital with broken bones. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, and thinks to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malcolm McDowell Clockwork Orange.png|thumb|Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex DeLarge]]\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as Mr Frank Alexander\n* [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Chief Guard Barnes\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Dim\n* [[John Clive]] as Stage Actor\n* [[Adrienne Corri]] as Mrs Mary Alexander\n* [[Carl Duering]] as Dr Brodsky\n* [[Paul Farrell]] as Tramp\n* [[Clive Francis]] as Joe the Lodger\n* [[Michael Gover]] as Prison Governor\n* [[Miriam Karlin]] as Catlady\n* [[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]] as Georgie\n* [[Aubrey Morris]] as P.

It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.}}\nAfter aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, though not through choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange\u2014organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. After Alex has undergone the Ludovico technique, the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false, arguing that true goodness ''must'' come from within. This leads to the theme of abusing liberties\u2014personal, governmental, civil\u2014by Alex, with two conflicting political forces, the Government and the Dissidents, both manipulating Alex purely for their own political ends.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Books of The Times |date=19 March 1963 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202042027/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The story portrays the \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" parties as equally worthy of criticism: the writer Frank Alexander, a victim of Alex and his gang, wants revenge against Alex ''and'' sees him as a means of definitively turning the populace against the incumbent government and its new regime. Mr Alexander fears the new government; in a telephone conversation, he says:\n{{Cquote|Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of [[totalitarianism]].}}\n\nOn the other side, the Minister of the Interior (the Government) jails Mr Alexander (the Dissident Intellectual) on the excuse of his endangering Alex (the People), rather than the government's totalitarian regime (described by Mr Alexander). It is unclear whether or not he has been harmed; however, the Minister tells Alex that the writer has been denied the ability to write and produce \"subversive\" material that is critical of the incumbent government and meant to provoke political unrest.\n\n===Psychology===\n[[File:LudovicoMalcolmMcDowellAClockworkOrangetrailer.png|thumb|Ludovico technique apparatus]]\nAnother target of criticism is the [[behaviourism]] or \"behavioural psychology\" propounded by psychologists [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' (1971) \"one of the most dangerous books ever written\". Although behaviourism's limitations were conceded by its principal founder, Watson, Skinner argued that [[behaviour modification]]\u2014specifically, [[operant conditioning]] (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the [[Classical conditioning|\"classical\" Watsonian conditioning]]\u2014is the key to an ideal society. The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived as a parody of [[aversion therapy]], which is a form of classical conditioning.<ref>{{cite web |author=Theodore Dalrymple |title=A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html |work=City Journal |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170544/http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | archive-date=1 February 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Paul Duncan said of Alex: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images. The implication is that all of the images, both real and imagined, are part of Alex's fantasies\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=142}} Psychiatrist Aaron Stern, the former head of the MPAA rating board, believed that Alex represents man in his natural state, the unconscious mind. Alex becomes \"civilised\" after receiving his Ludovico \"cure\" and the sickness in the aftermath Stern considered to be the \"neurosis imposed by society\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=128}} Kubrick told film critics Philip Strick and [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]] that he believed Alex \"makes no attempt to deceive himself or the audience as to his total corruption or wickedness. He is the very personification of evil.

Sound: 225,880 feet printed from 288 1/4\" reel to reel tapes.\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe cinematic adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1962) was not initially planned. [[Screenwriter|Screenplay writer]] [[Terry Southern]] gave Kubrick a copy of the novel, but, as he was developing a [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]-related project, Kubrick put it aside. Kubrick's wife, in an interview, stated she then gave him the novel after having read it. It had an immediate impact. Of his enthusiasm for it, Kubrick said, \"I was excited by everything about it: the plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level.\" Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, \"I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The ACO Controversy in the UK |website=Visual-memory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTHAmrtn?url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which omitted the final chapter.\n\n====Novelist's response====\nBurgess had mixed feelings about the film adaptation of his novel, publicly saying he loved [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]], and the use of music; he praised it as \"brilliant\", even so brilliant that it might be dangerous. Despite this enthusiasm, he was concerned that it lacked the novel's [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter|redemptive final chapter]], an absence he blamed upon his American publisher and not Kubrick. All US editions of the novel prior to 1986 omitted the final chapter.\n\nBurgess reports in his autobiography ''You've Had Your Time''&nbsp;(1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's novel ''[[Napoleon Symphony]]'' (1974) was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A [[lapsed Catholic]], Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organisations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf. Despite the benefits Burgess made from the film, he was in no way involved in the production of the book's adaptation. The only profit he made directly from the film was the initial $500 that was given to him for the rights to the adaptation.\n\n===Direction===\nKubrick was a perfectionist who researched meticulously, with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations, as well as many scene takes; however, per Malcolm McDowell, he usually \"got it right\" early on, so there were few takes. So meticulous was Kubrick that McDowell stated \"If Kubrick hadn't been a film director he'd have been a General Chief of Staff of the US Forces. No matter what it is\u2014even if it's a question of buying a shampoo it goes through him. He just likes total control.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=6-7}} Filming took place between September 1970 and April 1971, making ''A Clockwork Orange'' the quickest film shoot in his career.

The teenage slang has a heavily Russian influence, as in the novel; Burgess explains the slang as being, in part, intended to draw a reader into the world of the book's characters and to prevent the book from becoming outdated. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one, or perhaps a society evolving from a failed socialism into a fully authoritarian society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and in the film, there is a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed municipal architecture, and the name \"Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North\" alludes to socialist-style housing.<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \">[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417145347/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |date=17 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the film, when the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to exactly what kind of society it is. Kubrick asserted that the film held comparisons between both the left and right end of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated, \"The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left... They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.\"<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \"/>\n\n===Locations===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Thamesmead Housing Estate 01.jpg|thumb|Thamesmead South Housing Estate where Alex knocks his rebellious droogs into the lake in a sudden surprise attack]]\n''A Clockwork Orange'' was photographed mostly [[Filming location|on location]] in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]].\n\nShooting began on 7 September 1970 with call sheet no. 1 at the Duke Of New York pub: an unused scene and the first of many unused locations. A few days later, shooting commenced in Alex's Ludovico treatment bedroom and the [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|Serum 114]] injection by Dr Branom.\n\nNew Year's Eve started with rehearsals at the Korova Milk Bar and shooting finished after four continuous days on 8 January.\n\nThe last scenes were shot in February 1971, ending with call sheet no. 113. The last main scene to be filmed was Alex's fight with Billy Boy's gang, which took six days to cover. Shooting encompassed a total of around 113 days over six months of fairly continuous shooting. As is normal practice, there was no attempt to shoot the script in chronological order.\n\nThe few scenes not shot on location were the Korova Milk Bar, the prison check-in area, Alex having a bath at F. Alexander's house, and two corresponding scenes in the hallway. These sets were built at an old factory on Bullhead Road, [[Borehamwood]], which also served as the production office. Seven call sheets are missing from the Stanley Kubrick Archive, so some locations, such as the hallway, cannot be confirmed.\n\nOtherwise, locations used in the film include:\n* The attack on the tramp was filmed at the (since renovated) pedestrian underpass under York Road Roundabout at the southern end of [[Wandsworth Bridge]], [[Wandsworth|Wandsworth, London]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |last=Zicari |first=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |website=|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The unused scene of the attack on the professor was shot in [[Friars Square]] shopping centre in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, (then open, since covered) but dropped due to the actor dying.

An exterior blue plaque and mosaic at ground level commemorate the film's location.[[File:The Chelsea Drugstore.jpg|thumb|The Chelsea Drugstore in west London]]\n* The record shop where Alex picks up the two young women was in the basement of the former [[Chelsea Drugstore]], located on the corner of Royal Avenue and [[King's Road]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The 'Menacing Car scene' where the [[Probe 16|Durango '95]] forces the VW Beetle, motorcycle and Transit van off the road, were shot on Rectory Lane just south of Shenley Lodge. Driving under the lorry trailer was shot by [[Colney Heath]] on Bullens Green Lane at the crossroads of Fellowes Lane, Hertfordshire. \n* The home of the writer, site of the rape and beating, was filmed at three different locations: the arrival in the \"Durango 95\" by the \"HOME\" sign was shot on the lane leading to Munden House, which is off School Lane, [[Bricket Wood]], the house's exterior and garden with the footbridge over the pond is Milton Grundy's Japanese garden in [[Shipton-under-Wychwood]], Oxfordshire and the interior is Skybreak House in The Warren, [[Radlett]], [[Hertfordshire]].\n* Alex throws Dim and Georgie into Southmere Lake, which is adjacent to Binsey Walk at [[Thamesmead|Thamesmead South Housing Estate]], London. This is 200 yards north of Tavy Bridge precinct, where Alex walks home at night through an elevated plaza whistling and kicking rubbish. \n* The \"Duke Of New York\" pub is the since-demolished \"The Bottle and Dragon\" pub (formerly \"The Old Leather Bottle\") in [[Stonegrove estate|Stonegrove]], Edgware, London.\n* The Cat Lady house where Alex is caught by police is [[Manor Lodge School|Shenley Lodge]], Rectory Lane, Shenley, Hertfordshire.\n* The prison's exterior is [[HMP Wandsworth]], its interior is the [[Royal Artillery Barracks|Woolwich Barracks]]' since-demolished prison wing, Woolwich, London.\n* The chapel in which Alex scrolls the lyrics as the prisoners sing is a since-demolished lecture room at St. Edward's College, Totteridge Lane, North London. The library where he reads, fantasizes and then discusses the Ludovico Treatment with the priest was underneath the lecture room. The prison governor's office, where Alex signs consent for the Ludovico treatment, is on the same site (still standing).\n* The two biblical fantasy scenes (Christ and the fight scene) were filmed at Dashwood Mausoleum, [[West Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire.\n* The check-in at Ludovico Medical Clinic, the brain-washing film theatre, Alex's apartment block lobby with the broken elevator, Alex's hospital bedroom and police interrogation/beating room (since demolished) are all at [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]], Uxbridge, Middlesex.\n* The Minister's presentation to the media of Alex's \"cure\" takes place at the Nettlefold Hall inside West Norwood Library, [[West Norwood]], London.\n* Alex is attacked by vagrants underneath the north side of the [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]], Chelsea, London.\n* The scene where Dim and Georgie take Alex down the country lane in the police [[Land Rover]] and subsequent water trough beating is School Lane, Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire.\n* Alex's suicide bid leap and corresponding billiard room were at the old Edgwarebury Country Club, Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]], Hertfordshire.\n* The hospital in which Alex recovers is [[Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow|Princess Alexandra Hospital]], in [[Harlow]], Essex.\n* The final sexual fantasy was shot at the since-demolished [[Handley Page]] Ltd's hangars, [[Radlett]], Hertfordshire.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)}}\n\nDespite Alex's obsession with Beethoven, the soundtrack contains more music by [[Rossini]] than by Beethoven. The fast-motion sex scene with the two girls, the slow-motion fight between Alex and his Droogs, the fight with Billy Boy's gang, the drive to the writer's home (\"playing 'hogs of the road'\"), the invasion of the Cat Lady's home, and the scene where Alex looks into the river and contemplates suicide before being approached by the beggar are all accompanied by Rossini's music.<ref>''Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange''\n edited by Stuart Y.

While the film ends with Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with Alex's positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay on the novel's American edition, in which the final chapter had been deleted on the insistence of its American publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |website=Visual-memory.co.uk| access-date=1 May 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21| archive-date=18 August 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> He claimed not to have read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of ''A Clockwork Orange'' says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.\n* In the novel, Alex's last name was never revealed, while in the film, his surname is 'DeLarge', due to Alex's calling himself \"Alexander the Large\" in the novel.\n* At the beginning of the novel, Alex is a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. In the film, to lessen the controversy, Alex is portrayed as somewhat older, around 17 or 18.\n* Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a shambolic state of desperation, whereas the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<ref>Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed by Randy Rasmussen, p. 112</ref><br />One example of this would be differences in the portrayal of P. R. Deltoid, Alex's \"post-corrective advisor\". In the novel, P. R. Deltoid appears to have some [[moral authority]] (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime, despite his protests). In the film, Deltoid is slightly sadistic and seems to have a sexual interest in Alex, interviewing him in his parents' bedroom and smacking him in the crotch.\n* In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel.<ref>Stanley Kubrick by John Baxter, p. 255</ref>\n* In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through a number of careless references to the previous attack (e.g., his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too \"stiff\".<ref>Stanley Kubrick by Vincent LoBrutto pp. 365\u20136 and Stanley Kubrick, director by Alexander Walker, Sybil Taylor, Ulrich Ruchti, p. 204</ref>\n* In the novel, Alex is offered up for treatment after killing a fellow inmate who was sexually harassing him. In the film, this scene was cut out and, instead of Alex practically volunteering for the procedure, he was simply selected by the Interior Minister for speaking up during a ministerial inspection of the prison.\n* Alex's prison number in the novel is 6655321. His prison number in the film is 655321.\n* In the novel, Alex drugs and rapes two 10-year-old girls. In the film, the girls are young adults who seem to have consensual, playful sex with him, with no suggestion of using any drugs and without any violence.\n* In the novel, the writer was working on a manuscript called ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his gang are breaking into his house. In the movie, the title of the manuscript is not visible, leaving no literal reference to the title of the movie. Some explanations of the title are offered in the [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Title|Analysis]] section of the novel.\n* Early in both the novel and the film, Alex and his droogs brutally attack a drunk, homeless man. Later, when Alex is returned to society, he is recognised by the same man. The homeless man gathers several other homeless men to beat Alex, who is unable to defend himself. These later scenes do not appear in the book. After Alex is returned to society, he decides he wants to kill himself and goes to a library to find a book on how to do it. There, he is recognised by the man he had beaten and is attacked by him and a gang of other old library patrons.\n* Alex is beaten nearly to death by the police after his rehabilitation. In the film, the policemen are two of his former droogs, Dim and Georgie. In the book, instead of Georgie, who was said to have been killed, the second officer is Billyboy, the leader of the opposing gang whom Alex and his droogs fought earlier, both in the film and the book.\n* The film concludes with Alex recovering from his suicide attempt in hospital. In the novel, Alex leaves the hospital and forms a new band of droogs, but is unsatisfied by the violent activities which once entertained him. He encounters Peter (one of his former droogs) in a caf\u00e9, and is fascinated by the seemingly nonviolent life he now leads. The story closes with Alex suggesting that he might try to pursue a similar, peaceful lifestyle.\n* In the novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all music, but in the film he is only conditioned against [[Beethoven's 9th Symphony]].\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2000, the film was released on VHS and [[DVD]], both individually and as part of ''The Stanley Kubrick Collection'' DVD set. Due to negative comments from fans, Warner Bros re-released the film, its image digitally restored and its soundtrack remastered. A limited-edition collector's set with a soundtrack disc, film poster, booklet and film strip followed, but later was discontinued. In 2005, a British re-release, packaged as an \"Iconic Film\" in a limited-edition slipcase was published, identical to the remastered DVD set, except for different package cover art. In 2006, Warner Bros announced the September publication of a two-disc special edition featuring a Malcolm McDowell commentary, and the releases of other two-disc sets of Stanley Kubrick films. Several British retailers had set the release date as 6 November 2006; the release was delayed and re-announced for 2007 Holiday Season.\n\nAn [[HD DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and DVD re-release version of the film was released on 23 October 2007. The release accompanies four other Kubrick classics. 1080p video transfers and remixed Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (for HD DVD) and uncompressed 5.1 PCM (for Blu-ray) audio tracks are on both the Blu-ray and HD DVD editions. Unlike the previous version, the DVD re-release edition is anamorphically enhanced. The Blu-ray was reissued for the 40th anniversary of the film's release, identical to the previously released Blu-ray, apart from adding a Digibook and the ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'' documentary as a bonus feature.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlong with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), the film is considered a landmark in the relaxation of control on violence in the cinema.<ref>Ian MacDonald, ''Revolution in the Head'', Pimlico, p.235</ref>\n\n''A Clockwork Orange'' remains an influential work in cinema and other media.

The square and the surrounding historic townhouse structures were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] District in 1970. Planned as part of the pleasure grounds surrounding the Executive Mansion, this square was originally called \"President's Park\", which is now the name of the larger [[National Park Service]] unit. The park was separated from the White House grounds in 1804, when third President [[Thomas Jefferson]] had Pennsylvania Avenue cut through east-west. In 1824, the park was officially renamed in honor of the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], the [[Early modern France|Frenchman]] and military officer  who fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783).\n\nLafayette Square has been used as a racetrack, a graveyard, a zoo, a slave market, an encampment for soldiers during the [[War of 1812]], and many political protests and celebrations. [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] landscaped Lafayette Square in 1851 in the picturesque style.\n\n==The Ellipse==\n[[File:Aerial view of White House and the Ellipse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aerial view of the Ellipse and White House grounds]]\n{{Main|The Ellipse}}\n\nPresident's Park South (commonly called the Ellipse) is a {{convert|52|acre|ha}} park located just south of the White House fence. Properly, ''the Ellipse'' is the name of the five-furlong (1&nbsp;km) circumference street within the park.  The entire park is open to the public, and features various monuments. The Ellipse is also the location for a number of annual events.  D.C. locals can often be heard to say they are \"on the Ellipse\", which is understood to mean that the individual is on the field that is bounded by Ellipse Road.\n\nThe park was conceived in 1791, the first plan for the park was drawn up by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]], and during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the grounds of the Ellipse and incomplete [[Washington Monument]] were used as corrals for horses, mules, and cattle, and as camp sites for Union troops. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] began landscaping work on the Ellipse in 1867 and worked on it through the late 1880s.\n\n==White House Visitor Center==\n{{main|White House Visitor Center}}\nThe White House Visitor Center is located in the north end of the [[Herbert C. Hoover Building]] (the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] [[headquarters]] between 14th Street and 15th Street on Pennsylvania Avenue NW). Since [[September 11, 2001]], the [[visitor center]] no longer serves as a starting point for those going on a reserved tour of the White House.  The various exhibits provide an alternative visitor experience for those who did not schedule a tour.  The themes of the six permanent exhibits are First Families, Symbols & Images, White House Architecture, White House Interiors, Working White House, and Ceremonies and Celebrations. Other exhibits change throughout the year.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The National Parks: Index 2001\u20132003''.

[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] landscaped Lafayette Square in 1851 in the picturesque style.\n\n==The Ellipse==\n[[File:Aerial view of White House and the Ellipse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aerial view of the Ellipse and White House grounds]]\n{{Main|The Ellipse}}\n\nPresident's Park South (commonly called the Ellipse) is a {{convert|52|acre|ha}} park located just south of the White House fence. Properly, ''the Ellipse'' is the name of the five-furlong (1&nbsp;km) circumference street within the park.  The entire park is open to the public, and features various monuments. The Ellipse is also the location for a number of annual events.  D.C. locals can often be heard to say they are \"on the Ellipse\", which is understood to mean that the individual is on the field that is bounded by Ellipse Road.\n\nThe park was conceived in 1791, the first plan for the park was drawn up by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]], and during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), the grounds of the Ellipse and incomplete [[Washington Monument]] were used as corrals for horses, mules, and cattle, and as camp sites for Union troops. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] began landscaping work on the Ellipse in 1867 and worked on it through the late 1880s.\n\n==White House Visitor Center==\n{{main|White House Visitor Center}}\nThe White House Visitor Center is located in the north end of the [[Herbert C. Hoover Building]] (the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] [[headquarters]] between 14th Street and 15th Street on Pennsylvania Avenue NW). Since [[September 11, 2001]], the [[visitor center]] no longer serves as a starting point for those going on a reserved tour of the White House.  The various exhibits provide an alternative visitor experience for those who did not schedule a tour.  The themes of the six permanent exhibits are First Families, Symbols & Images, White House Architecture, White House Interiors, Working White House, and Ceremonies and Celebrations. Other exhibits change throughout the year.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The National Parks: Index 2001-2003''.

Vijay sustains minor injuries as a result of a [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] charge set by him to kill the terrorist leader ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]). He then experiences a series of visuals resembling his younger brother. Meanwhile, at a [[military hospital]] Vijay meets his girlfriend Teju ([[Raveena Tandon]]), a news presenter in Star News channel who he is ready to marry. Teju reveals she is pregnant after she presents her [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]] report to Vijay after one of their dates gone wrong. Vijay then reveals his plan to visit his younger brother in asylum who is implicated for murdering his step-mother to Tejaswini. Vijay's twin brother, Nandakumar \"Nandu\" ([[Kamal Haasan]]), is a paranoid [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] man who has spent most of his life in the asylum. Vijay cares about Nandu and looks forward to his release, but Nandakumar's doctor ([[Gollapudi Maruti Rao]]) tells him that Nandu has developed into a psychopath. He is now a danger to society and should not be released.\n\nVijay and Teju visit Nandu to share the news about their impending marriage, which turns disastrous as Nandu begins to see Teju in the image of his stepmother. Seeking to save Vijay from Teju, Nandu manages to escape custody after killing two other inmates Sulthan ([[Riyaz Khan]]) and Paasha for a clean getaway thus leaving no trail. He later meets his maternal uncle ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), who was responsible for incarcerating him. The man dies of choking upon seeing his nephew. Vijay & Teju gets [[Marriage|married]] & have sex. The next day Vijay and Teju are shocked to learn of Nandu's escape. Vijay initially refuses to believe it was Nandu who escaped. But, Nandu's doctor believes it was Nandu who escaped, because of the similarity that both Nandhu and his murdered buddy Sulthan are [[Circumcision|circumcised]] due to health reasons after the [[autopsy|post mortem]] of Sulthan's [[decapitation|beheaded]] corpse, thus proving Nandu is circumcised. But, Vijay is convinced that it was Nandu.\n\nNandu visits Vijay's home when he is not there and leaves a message about wanting to kill Teju. He keeps [[Hallucination|hallucinating]] about his deceased mother in his imagination. While searching for Teju, Nandu meets socialite Sharmilee ([[Manisha Koirala]]) and they both develop a liking for each other. He insists that he is a [[necrophilia|necrophilic]] when Sharmilee reveals her dislike for Teju when she encounters her prior to the concert where Teju refused to smoke as she is pregnant. Being drugged, Nandu hallucinates about Sharmilee as his stepmother and brutally murders her. After returning to his senses, he regrets his actions and burns Sharmilee's corpse before exiting the room, but leaves behind evidence through which Vijay deduces him as the murderer.\n\nVijay and Teju leave for Vijay's ancestral home in [[Ooty]] to stay safe from Nandu, but he secretly follows them. Vijay and Teju find Nandu's old diary in the house through which they read his past: Vijay and Nandu's mother ([[Anu Haasan]]) committed suicide after realising that Santosh ([[Milind Gunaji]]) their father was having an affair with Jayanthi ([[Kitu Gidwani]]) who later became their stepmother. Both brothers hate her and Nandu becomes violent at school. The teacher ([[Poovilangu Mohan]]) complains about this and Nandu justifies that he is only reflecting the home environment. Enraged, Santosh beats both his sons for disliking his new wife.\n\nOne day, the brothers learn that Jayanthi is having an affair with another man and Nandu tries telling this to his father who pays no heed, and instead beats him. Nandu pleads to his maternal uncle to take him along with him. But as he is suffering from throat cancer, he refuses and suggests a boarding school. Eventually, Vijay leaves with his uncle to a boarding school while Nandu remains home.\n\nThe situation gets worse at home with Nandu and Jayanthi turning violent and Santosh gets a heart attack. Nandu overhears a conversation between Jayanthi and a lawyer, and realises that she is only after his father's wealth. Seeing this, Santosh dies due to another heart attack. Nandu now starts to see both his deceased parents in his hallucinations. His mother gives him the mission of killing Jayanthi, which Nandu does. Nandu stays with the corpses in the house before being incarcerated at the asylum.\n\nIn the present, Vijay learns from his old friend Thenkoshut that Nandu has reached Ooty. Vijay reaches on time to save Teju from Nandu, who entered their hotel room and leaves with her. Nandu after getting a [[Snake|serpent]] styled [[tattoo]] all over his body which resembles the bond between the brothers by Thenkoshut (Krishna Bhatt) decides to exact revenge on Tejaswini. He chases the couple wreaking havoc across the road. After a while they escape from the clutches of Nandu, Vijay manages to push Nandu's car into an abyss and assumes he is dead. However, Nandu escapes and continues his trail. Vijay plans to leave the city and notices Nandu coming to the hotel secretly.\n\nVijay and his commandos try to nab him but he takes on everyone and kills many. Finally, the brothers have a fight where Nandu overcomes Vijay. He corners Teju who starts whacking him with a belt in self-defense, reminding Nandu of Jayanthi's manner of punishing him. Vijay reaches by then and there is another fight between the brothers. Nandu visualises his mother asking him to join her as Jayanthi is torturing her [[Otherworld|up there]]. He realises his mistake and apologises to Vijay for chasing Teju. To kill his stepmother, he lights up some cylinders which explode, killing him.\n\nTeju is later revealed to be pregnant with twins. She fears they will have the same traumatic childhood Vijay and Nandu had, but Vijay comforts her by telling her that they are good parents and nothing will happen.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Tamil version===\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Nandha Kumar (Nandhu), Vijay Kumar (Vijay)\n* [[Raveena Tandon]] as Tejaswini 'Teju', [[News reporter]] for Star News channel\n* [[Manisha Koirala]] as Sharmilee \n* [[Gollapudi Maruti Rao]] as the Psychiatrist doctor\n* [[Milind Gunaji]] as [[Colonel]] Santosh Kumar, Nandhu and Vijay's father\n* [[Sarath Babu]] as Tejaswini's father\n* [[Fathima Babu]] as Tejaswini's mother\n* [[Anu Haasan]] as Priya, Nandhu and Vijay's mother (cameo)\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Jayanthi, Nandhu and Vijay's stepmother\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Sulthan\n* [[Vikram Gokhale]] as Nandhu and Vijay's maternal uncle Ranganath\n*[[Poovilangu Mohan]] as Nandhu and Vijay's headmaster\n* [[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]] as the Kashmir [[Terrorism|militant]]\n* [[Major Ravi]] as Menon, Vijay's [[commando]] buddy\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Sonu\n* Raji Iyer as Malathi, Teju's coworker in Star News channel\n* Krishna Bhatt as Tenoosh Kooth, a mentally unstable tribesman)\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] in \"Siri Siri\" song (uncredited role)\n{{colend}}\n\n===Hindi version===\nAll characters mentioned above in the Tamil version are the same in the Hindi version except Nandu's name, the doctor's character and Tejaswini's parents characters have been played by different actors.\n* Kamal Haasan as Major Vijay Kumar 'Vijay' and Abhay Kumar 'Abhay'<ref name=\"Abhay Characters\"/>\n*[[Naveen Nischol]] as Ravinder, Tejaswini's father<ref name=\"Abhay Characters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/abhay/charac.htm|title= Abhay Characters|website=rediff.com}}</ref>\n* [[Smita Jaykar]] as Geeta, Tejaswini's mother\n* [[Vallabh Vyas]] as  Srinivasa Rao, Psychiatrist doctor\n\n== Production ==\n{{quote box\n| quote=''Dhayam'' was a novel written by [Kamal] for a magazine long back, and it talked about a pair of twin brothers, one being an \u2018animal\u2019 (Nandhu) and the other a \u2018trained animal\u2019 (Vijay).

Vijay sustains minor injuries as a result of a [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] charge set by him to kill the terrorist leader ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]). He then experiences a series of visuals resembling his younger brother. Meanwhile, at a [[military hospital]] Vijay meets his girlfriend Teju ([[Raveena Tandon]]), a news presenter in Star News channel who he is ready to marry. Teju reveals she is pregnant after she presents her [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]] report to Vijay after one of their dates gone wrong. Vijay then reveals his plan to visit his younger brother in asylum who is implicated for murdering his step-mother to Tejaswini. Vijay\u2019s twin brother, Nandakumar \"Nandu\" ([[Kamal Haasan]]), is a paranoid [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] man who has spent most of his life in the asylum. Vijay cares about Nandu and looks forward to his release, but Nandakumar\u2019s doctor ([[Gollapudi Maruti Rao]]) tells him that Nandu has developed into a psychopath. He is now a danger to society and should not be released.\n\nVijay and Teju visit Nandu to share the news about their impending marriage, which turns disastrous as Nandu begins to see Teju in the image of his stepmother. Seeking to save Vijay from Teju, Nandu manages to escape custody after killing two other inmates Sulthan ([[Riyaz Khan]]) and Paasha for a clean getaway thus leaving no trail. He later meets his maternal uncle ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), who was responsible for incarcerating him. The man dies of choking upon seeing his nephew. Vijay & Teju gets [[Marriage|married]] & have sex. The next day Vijay and Teju are shocked to learn of Nandu's escape. Vijay initially refuses to believe it was Nandu who escaped. But, Nandu's doctor believes it was Nandu who escaped, because of the similarity that both Nandhu and his murdered buddy Sulthan are [[Circumcision|circumcised]] due to health reasons after the [[autopsy|post mortem]] of Sulthan\u2019s [[decapitation|beheaded]] corpse, thus proving Nandu is circumcised. But, Vijay is convinced that it was Nandu.\n\nNandu visits Vijay's home when he is not there and leaves a message about wanting to kill Teju. He keeps [[Hallucination|hallucinating]] about his deceased mother in his imagination. While searching for Teju, Nandu meets socialite Sharmilee ([[Manisha Koirala]]) and they both develop a liking for each other. He insists that he is a [[necrophilia|necrophilic]] when Sharmilee reveals her dislike for Teju when she encounters her prior to the concert where Teju refused to smoke as she is pregnant. Being drugged, Nandu hallucinates about Sharmilee as his stepmother and brutally murders her. After returning to his senses, he regrets his actions and burns Sharmilee's corpse before exiting the room, but leaves behind evidence through which Vijay deduces him as the murderer.\n\nVijay and Teju leave for Vijay's ancestral home in [[Ooty]] to stay safe from Nandu, but he secretly follows them. Vijay and Teju find Nandu's old diary in the house through which they read his past: Vijay and Nandu's mother ([[Anu Haasan]]) committed suicide after realising that Santosh ([[Milind Gunaji]]) their father was having an affair with Jayanthi ([[Kitu Gidwani]]) who later became their stepmother. Both brothers hate her and Nandu becomes violent at school. The teacher ([[Poovilangu Mohan]]) complains about this and Nandu justifies that he is only reflecting the home environment. Enraged, Santosh beats both his sons for disliking his new wife.\n\nOne day, the brothers learn that Jayanthi is having an affair with another man and Nandu tries telling this to his father who pays no heed, and instead beats him. Nandu pleads to his maternal uncle to take him along with him. But as he is suffering from throat cancer, he refuses and suggests a boarding school. Eventually, Vijay leaves with his uncle to a boarding school while Nandu remains home.\n\nThe situation gets worse at home with Nandu and Jayanthi turning violent and Santosh gets a heart attack. Nandu overhears a conversation between Jayanthi and a lawyer, and realises that she is only after his father's wealth. Seeing this, Santosh dies due to another heart attack. Nandu now starts to see both his deceased parents in his hallucinations. His mother gives him the mission of killing Jayanthi, which Nandu does. Nandu stays with the corpses in the house before being incarcerated at the asylum.\n\nIn the present, Vijay learns from his old friend Thenkoshut that Nandu has reached Ooty. Vijay reaches on time to save Teju from Nandu, who entered their hotel room and leaves with her. Nandu after getting a [[Snake|serpent]] styled [[tattoo]] all over his body which resembles the bond between the brothers by Thenkoshut (Krishna Bhatt) decides to exact revenge on Tejaswini. He chases the couple wreaking havoc across the road. After a while they escape from the clutches of Nandu, Vijay manages to push Nandu's car into an abyss and assumes he is dead. However, Nandu escapes and continues his trail. Vijay plans to leave the city and notices Nandu coming to the hotel secretly.\n\nVijay and his commandos try to nab him but he takes on everyone and kills many. Finally, the brothers have a fight where Nandu overcomes Vijay. He corners Teju who starts whacking him with a belt in self-defense, reminding Nandu of Jayanthi's manner of punishing him. Vijay reaches by then and there is another fight between the brothers. Nandu visualises his mother asking him to join her as Jayanthi is torturing her [[Otherworld|up there]]. He realises his mistake and apologises to Vijay for chasing Teju. To kill his stepmother, he lights up some cylinders which explode, killing him.\n\nTeju is later revealed to be pregnant with twins. She fears they will have the same traumatic childhood Vijay and Nandu had, but Vijay comforts her by telling her that they are good parents and nothing will happen.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Tamil version===\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Nandha Kumar (Nandhu), Vijay Kumar (Vijay)\n* [[Raveena Tandon]] as Tejaswini 'Teju', [[News reporter]] for Star News channel\n* [[Manisha Koirala]] as Sharmilee \n* [[Gollapudi Maruti Rao]] as the Psychiatrist doctor\n* [[Milind Gunaji]] as [[Colonel]] Santosh Kumar, Nandhu and Vijay's father\n* [[Sarath Babu]] as Tejaswini's father\n* [[Fathima Babu]] as Tejaswini's mother\n* [[Anu Haasan]] as Priya, Nandhu and Vijay's mother (cameo)\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Jayanthi, Nandhu and Vijay's stepmother\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Sulthan\n* [[Vikram Gokhale]] as Nandhu and Vijay's maternal uncle Ranganath\n*[[Poovilangu Mohan]] as Nandhu and Vijay's headmaster\n* [[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]] as the Kashmir [[Terrorism|militant]]\n* [[Major Ravi]] as Menon, Vijay\u2019s [[commando]] buddy\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Sonu\n* Raji Iyer as Malathi, Teju\u2019s coworker in Star News channel\n* Krishna Bhatt as Tenoosh Kooth, a mentally unstable tribesman)\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] in \"Siri Siri\" song (uncredited role)\n{{colend}}\n\n===Hindi version===\nAll characters mentioned above in the Tamil version are the same in the Hindi version except Nandu's name, the doctor's character and Tejaswini's parents characters have been played by different actors.\n* Kamal Haasan as Major Vijay Kumar 'Vijay' and Abhay Kumar 'Abhay'<ref name=\"Abhay Characters\"/>\n*[[Naveen Nischol]] as Ravinder, Tejaswini's father<ref name=\"Abhay Characters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/abhay/charac.htm|title= Abhay Characters|website=rediff.com}}</ref>\n* [[Smita Jaykar]] as Geeta, Tejaswini's mother\n* [[Vallabh Vyas]] as  Srinivasa Rao, Psychiatrist doctor\n\n== Production ==\n{{quote box\n| quote=''Dhayam'' was a novel written by [Kamal] for a magazine long back, and it talked about a pair of twin brothers, one being an \u2018animal\u2019 (Nandhu) and the other a \u2018trained animal\u2019 (Vijay).

Rex ([[Zaijian Jaranilla|Zaijian Jaranilla)]] is a sensitive loner who is neglected by his mother and lives under the shadow of his brother. His life only seems to be a parade of depressing experiences that peaks with a humiliating incident, which cements his outcast status at school. Despite this, he finds a ray of hope in his budding romance with his crush\u2014until she leaves him thoroughly heartbroken. Tired of his depressing life and being ignored by everyone including his family, Rex makes a drastic decision and disappears from their lives. Rex\u2019s parents make a frantic search for the missing boy, but their hopes are crushed when they finally find a body. They mourn his death and slowly realize that they somehow contributed to the misery in Rex\u2019s life. However, little clues show the continued presence of Rex in the lives of his loved ones, who accidentally stumble upon a discovery that will shake Rex\u2019s family to the core.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Zaijian Jaranilla|Zaijan Jaranilla]]\n* Tart Carlos \n* [[Iyah Mina]]\n* Raul Montessa\n* Vance Larena\n* [[Belle Mariano]]\n* Alyanna Angeles.\n\n== Release ==\n''The Story of my Life'' premiered on December 27, 2019 on [[ABS-CBN]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bandera.inquirer.net/238532/zaijian-lalabanan-ang-depresyon-bullying-sa-story-of-my-life-ng-iwant|title=Zaijian lalabanan ang depresyon, bullying sa \u2018Story Of My Life\u2019 ng iWant|website=bandera.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2020/02/29/1996808/zaijian-cute-vin-hot|title=Zaijian is cute\u2026 Vin is hot!|last=Abunda|first=Boy|website=philstar.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Story of My Life\n| italic_title             = \n| image                    = \n| image_upright            = \n| image_size               = \n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = Kwento ng Aking Buhay\n| native_name              = <!-- {{Infobox name module|language|title}} or {{Infobox name module|title}} -->\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Drama]]\n* [[Miniseries]]\n}}\n| creator                  = \n| based_on                 = <!-- {{Based on|work|author}} -->\n| developer                = \n| screenplay               = \n| writer                   = Maribel Ilag\n| story                    = \n| director                 = Barry Gonzales III\n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| starring                 = [[Zaijan Jaranilla]]\n| judges                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| voices                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| narrated                 = \n| composer                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| company                  = \n| num_episodes             = <!-- Value is incremented when new episodes air.
