Lasting from 1648 to 1669, or a total of 21 years, it is the second longest siege in history after the [[Sieges of Ceuta (1694\u20131727)|siege of Ceuta]]; however, the Ottomans were ultimately victorious despite Candia's unprecedented resistance.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 17th century, Venice's power in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] was waning, as Ottoman power grew. The [[Republic of Venice]] believed that the Ottomans would use any excuse to pursue further hostilities.\n\nIn 1644, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] attacked an Ottoman convoy on its way from [[Alexandria]] to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. They landed at Candia with the loot, which included the former Chief Black Eunuch of the Harem, the kadi of Cairo, among other pilgrims heading to [[Mecca]].\n\nIn response, 60,000 Ottoman troops led by [[Silahdar Yusuf Pasha|Yusuf Pasha]] disembarked on Venetian Crete with no apparent target, with many suspecting them heading for Malta. Instead the Ottomans surprisingly struck against Crete in June 1645, besieging and occupying La Canea (modern [[Chania]]) and Rettimo (modern [[Rethimno]]). Both of these cities took two months each to conquer. Between 1645 and 1648, the Ottomans occupied the rest of the island and prepared to take the capital, Candia.\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Candia III.jpg|thumb|left|Candia and [[Fortifications of Heraklion|its fortifications]], 1651]]\nThe siege of Candia began in May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months laying siege to the city, cutting off the water supply, and disrupting Venice's sea lanes to the city. For the next 16 years, they would bombard the city to little effect.\n\nThe Venetians, in turn, sought to [[blockade]] the Ottoman-held [[Dardanelles]] to prevent the resupply of the Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete. This effort led to a series of [[List of naval battles#Cretan War .281645.E2.80.9369.29|naval actions]]. On 21 June 1655 and 26 August 1656, the Venetians were victorious, although the Venetian commander, [[Lorenzo Marcello]], was killed in the latter engagement. However, on 17\u201319 July 1657, the Ottoman navy soundly defeated the Venetians and the Venetian captain, [[Lazzaro Mocenigo]], was killed by a falling mast.\n\nVenice received more aid from other western European states after the 7 November 1659 ''[[Treaty of the Pyrenees]]'' and the consequent peace between [[France]] and [[Spain]]. However, the [[Peace of Vasv\u00e1r]] (August 1664) released additional Ottoman forces for action against the Venetians in Candia.\n\nIn 1666, a Venetian attempt to recapture La Canea failed. The following year, Colonel Andrea Barozzi, a Venetian [[military engineer]], defected to the Ottomans and gave them information on weak spots in [[Fortifications of Heraklion|Candia's fortifications]]. On 24 July 1669, a French land/sea expedition under [[Mocenigo]] not only failed to lift the siege, but also lost the fleet's vice-flagship, [[French ship Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (1665)|''La Th\u00e9r\u00e8se'']] a 900-ton French warship armed with 58 cannons, to an accidental explosion. This dual disaster was devastating to the morale of the city's defenders.\n\nApparently chastened by their failed relief effort and the loss of so valuable a warship, the French abandoned Candia in August 1669 leaving [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] General [[Francesco Morosini]], the commander of Venetian forces, with only 3,600 fit men and scant supplies to defend the fortress. He, therefore, accepted terms and surrendered to [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed|Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc]], the [[Grand Vizier]] of the Ottoman Empire of on 27 September 1669. However, his surrender without first receiving authorization to do so from the Venetian [[Senate]] made Morosini a controversial figure in Venice for some years afterward.\n\nAs part of the surrender terms, all Christians were allowed to leave Candia with whatever they could carry while Venice retained possession of [[Gramvousa]], [[Souda Island|Souda]] and [[Spinalonga]], fortified islands that shielded natural harbors where Venetian ships could stop during their voyages to the eastern Mediterranean. After Candia's fall, the Venetians somewhat offset their defeat by expanding their holdings in [[Dalmatia]].\n\n== Proposed biological warfare attack ==\nData obtained from the Archives of the Venetian State, relating to an operation organized by the Venetian Intelligence Services, describes a plan aimed at lifting the siege by infecting the Ottoman soldiers with [[Bubonic plague|plague]]; this was to be done by attacking them with a liquid made from the [[spleen]]s and buboes of plague victims.

It is conducted throughout the world on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (with a calendar day reckoned to start at sunset).  The day falls in late March or in April of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the Passover lasts for 7 days in Israel and 8 days outside Israel. Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many Diaspora communities hold a seder also on the second night. The Seder is a ritual performed by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling of the story of the liberation of the [[Israelites]] from [[slavery]] in [[ancient Egypt]].  This story is in the [[Book of Exodus]] (''Shemot'') in The [[Hebrew Bible]].  The Seder itself is based on the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] verse [[613 Mitzvot|commanding]] Jews to retell the story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]: \"You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what [[Tetragrammaton|the LORD]] did for me when I came out of Egypt.'\" (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the [[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]], an ancient work derived from the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Pesahim]]'' 10).<ref>\"Haggadah, Passover.\" Ernst Goldschmidt, Bezalel Narkiss, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Robert Weltsch, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Cecil Roth, Hanoch Avenary, and Jody Myers.

It is customary to invite guests, especially strangers and the needy. The Seder is integral to Jewish faith and identity: as explained in the Haggadah, if not for [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and the Exodus, the Jewish people would still be [[slaves]] in Egypt. Therefore, the Seder is an occasion for praise and thanksgiving and for re-dedication to the idea of liberation. Furthermore, the words and rituals of the Seder are a primary vehicle for the transmission of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] from grandparent to child, and from one generation to the next. Attending a Seder and eating matza on Passover is a widespread custom in the Jewish community, even among those who are not religiously observant.\n\n[[File:1850ukr pesah.jpg|thumb|265px|A Ukrainian 19th-century [[lubok]] representing the Seder table]]\nThe Seder table is traditionally set with the finest place settings and silverware, and family members come to the table dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a [[kittel]].<ref name=MB>Mishnah Berurah, 472:13</ref><ref name=Eider>{{Cite book|last=Eider |first=Shimon |authorlink=Shimon Eider |title=Halachos of Pesach |publisher=Feldheim publishers |isbn=978-0-87306-864-2|year=1998 }}</ref> For the first half of the Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine glass. At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three [[matzo]]t and dishes of salt water for dipping.\n\nEach participant receives a copy of the Haggadah, which is often a traditional version: an ancient text that contains the complete Seder service. Men and women are equally obliged and eligible to participate in the Seder.<ref name=chinuch>sefer hachinuch, mi tzvah 21</ref> In many homes, each participant at the Seder table will recite at least critical parts of the Haggadah in the original Hebrew and Aramaic. [[Halakha]]h requires that certain parts be said in language the participants can understand, and critical parts are often said in both Hebrew and the native language. The leader will often interrupt the reading to discuss different points with his or her children, or to offer a Torah insight into the meaning or interpretation of the words.\n\nIn some homes, participants take turns reciting the text of the Haggadah, in the original Hebrew or in translation. It is traditional for the head of the household and other participants to have pillows placed behind them for added comfort. At several points during the Seder, participants lean to the left \u2013 when drinking the four cups of wine, eating the Afikoman, and eating the korech sandwich.<ref name=Eider />\n\nJews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]] communities, sometimes excluding [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews, hold a seder also on the second night. Seders have been observed around the world, including in remote places such as high in the Himalaya mountains in [[Kathmandu, Nepal]].<ref>April 14, 2014, Israel National News, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/291149#.U6ixzpRX9pA Volunteers Save Kathmandu Seder], Accessed June 22, 2014, \"...Chabad house, which is expecting over 1,000 people for Monday night's seder...\"</ref><ref>April 15th, 2014, Global Post, [http://www.globalpost.com/photo-galleries/planet-pic/6122264/kathmandu-jerusalem-how-jews-around-the-world-are-celebrating-passover From Kathmandu to Jerusalem, how Jews around the world are celebrating Passover], Accessed June 28, 2014</ref>\n\n==Themes of the Seder==\n\n===Slavery and Freedom===\n[[File:Matzah.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Machine-made [[matzo]]]]\nThe rituals and symbolic foods evoke the twin themes of the evening: slavery and freedom. It is stated in the Hagaddah that \"In every generation everyone is obligated to see themselves as if they themselves came out of Egypt\" \u2013 i.e., out of slavery.\n\nThe rendering of time for the Hebrews was that a day began at sunset and ended at sunset. Historically, at the beginning of the 15th of [[Nisan]] in Ancient Egypt, the Jewish people were enslaved to Pharaoh. After the [[Plagues of Egypt#Death of Firstborn (11:1 - 12:36) \u05de\u05b7\u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea|tenth plague]] struck Egypt at midnight, killing all the first-born sons from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the lowest Egyptian to all the first-born of the livestock in the land (Exodus 12:29), Pharaoh let the Hebrew nation go, effectively making them free people for the second half of the night.\n\nThus, Seder participants recall the slavery that reigned during the first half of the night by eating [[matzo]] (the \"poor person's bread\"), [[maror]] (bitter herbs which symbolize the bitterness of slavery), and charoset (a sweet paste representing the mortar which the Jewish slaves used to cement bricks). Recalling the freedom of the second half of the night, they eat the matzo (the \"bread of freedom\" as well as the \"bread of affliction\") and '[[afikoman]]', and drink the four cups of wine, in a reclining position, and dip vegetables into salt water (the dipping being a sign of royalty and freedom).\n\n===The Four Cups===\nThere is an obligation to drink four cups of wine during the Seder. The [[Mishnah]] says ([[Pesachim|Pes.]] 10:1) that even the poor are obliged to drink the four cups. Each cup is imbibed at a specific point in the Seder. The first is for [[Kiddush]] (\u05e7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9), the second is for '[[Maggid]]' (\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3), the third is for [[Birkat Hamazon]] (\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d5\u05df) and the fourth is for [[Hallel]] (\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc).<ref name=\"Marcus\">{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Yossef |title=What is the significance of the four cups of wine? |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |work=Chabad |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421031844/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |archivedate=21 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Seder in a Nutshell |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |work=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317234258/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}</ref>\n[[File:Pessach Pesach Pascha Judentum Ungesaeuert Seder datafox.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Passover Seder table]]\n[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Traditional arrangement of symbolic foods on a Passover Seder plate]]\n\nThe Four Cups represent the four expressions of deliverance promised by God {{bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}: \"I will bring out,\" \"I will deliver,\" \"I will redeem,\" and \"I will take.\"<ref name=\"Marcus\"/>\n\nThe [[Vilna Gaon]] relates the Four Cups to four worlds: this world, the [[Messiah|Messianic]] age, the world at the revival of the dead, and the [[world to come]]. The [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|MaHaRaL]] connects them to the four Matriarchs: [[Sarah]], [[Rebeccah]], [[Rachel]], and [[Leah]]. (The three [[matzo]]t, in turn, are connected to the three Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) [[Isaac Abrabanel|Abarbanel]] relates the cups to the four historical redemptions of the Jewish people: the choosing of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt, the survival of the Jewish people throughout the exile, and the fourth which will happen at the end of days.\n\nThe four cups might also reflect the Roman custom of drinking as many cups as there are letters in the name of the chief guest at a meal, which in the case of the Seder is God Himself whose Hebrew name has four letters.<ref>{{cite web|title=OzTorah: Four Cups of Wine|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2012/04/four-cups-of-wine/|work=Oztorah.com|publisher=Rabbi Raymond Apple|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Seder plate===\n\nThe special Passover Seder plate (''ke'are'') is a special plate containing symbolic foods used during the Passover Seder. Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The seventh symbolic item used during the meal \u2013 a stack of three matzot \u2013 is placed on its own plate on the Seder table.\n\nThe six items on the Seder plate are:\n* ''[[Maror]]'': Bitter herbs, symbolizing the bitterness and harshness of the slavery which the Jews endured in Ancient Egypt. For ''maror'', many people use freshly grated horseradish or whole horseradish root.\n* ''Chazeret'' is typically romaine lettuce, whose roots are bitter-tasting. In addition to horseradish and romaine lettuce, other forms of bitter lettuce, such as [[endive]], may be eaten in fulfillment of the [[mitzvah]], as well as green onions, dandelion greens, celery leaves, or curly parsley (but parsley and celery are more commonly used as the karpas or vegetable element).  Much depends upon whether one's tradition is Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrahi, Persian, or one of the many other Jewish ethno-cultural traditions.\n* ''[[Charoset]]'': A sweet, brown, pebbly paste of fruits and nuts, representing the mortar used by the Jewish slaves to build the storehouses of Egypt.  The actual recipe depends partly on ethno-cultural tradition and partly on locally available ingredients.  Ashkenazi Jews, for example, traditionally make apple-raisin based charoset while Sephardic Jews often make date-based recipes that might feature orange or/and lemon, or even banana.\n* ''[[Karpas]]'': A vegetable other than bitter herbs, usually parsley but sometimes something such as [[celery]] or cooked [[potato]], which is dipped into salt water (Ashkenazi custom), vinegar (Sephardi custom), or [[charoset]] (older custom, still common amongst [[Yemenite Jews]]) at the beginning of the Seder.\n* ''[[Zeroa]]'': A roasted lamb or goat bone, symbolizing the ''korban Pesach'' (Pesach sacrifice), which was a lamb offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.\n* ''Beitzah'': A roast egg \u2013 usually a [[hard-boiled egg]] that has been roasted in a baking pan with a little oil, or with a lamb shank \u2013 symbolizing the ''korban chagigah'' (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.\n\n===Focus on the children===\nSince the retelling of the Exodus to one's child is the object of the Seder experience, much effort is made to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children and keep them awake during the meal. To that end, questions and answers are a central device in the Seder ritual. By encouraging children to ask questions, they will be more open to hearing the answers.\n\nThe most famous question which the youngest child asks at the Seder is the \"''[[Ma Nishtana]]''\" \u2013 'Why is this night different from all other nights?' After the asking of this questions, the main portion of the Seder, ''Magid'', discusses the answers in the form of a historical review. Also, at different points in the Seder, the leader of the Seder will cover the matzot and lift their cup of wine; then put down the cup of wine and uncover the matzot \u2013 all to elicit questions from the children.<ref name=manishtana>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\nIn Sephardic tradition, the questions are asked by the assembled company in chorus rather than by a child, and are put to the leader of the seder, who either answers the question or may direct the attention of the assembled company to someone who is acting out that particular part of the Exodus.  Physical re-enactment of the Exodus during the Passover seder is common in many families and communities, especially amongst Sephardim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/sephardicpassovercustoms.html|title=Sephardic Passover (Pesach) Customs and Traditions|website=www.angelfire.com}}</ref>\n\nFamilies will follow the Haggadah's lead by asking their own questions at various points in the Haggadah and offering prizes such as nuts and candies for correct answers. The ''[[afikoman]]'', which is hidden away for the \"dessert\" after the meal, is another device used to encourage children's participation. In some families, the leader of the Seder hides the ''afikoman'' and the children must find it, whereupon they receive a prize or reward. In other homes, the children hide the ''afikoman'' and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize (often money) for revealing its location.\n\n==Order of the Seder==\nThe order and procedures of the Seder are stated and printed in the text of the Passover [[Haggadah]], a copy of which is in front of all participants. Jewish children learn the following words, denoting the order of the Seder, with a rhyme and tune at their Jewish schools:\n\n{{quote|[[#Kadeish (blessings and the first cup of wine)|Kaddesh]] ({{lang|he|\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9}}).

It should be recited as soon as the synagogue services are over but not before nightfall.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" /> This ''Kiddush'' is similar to that which is recited on all of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], but also refers to [[matzot]] and the exodus from Egypt. Acting in a way that shows freedom and majesty, many Jews have the custom of filling each other's cups at the Seder table. The Kiddush is traditionally said by the father of the house, but all Seder participants may participate by reciting the Kiddush and drinking at least a majority of the first cup of wine.\n\n===''Urchatz'' (wash hands)===\nTechnically, according to [[Jewish law]], whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one's hands if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, at other times of the year, one has either already washed their hands before eating bread, or dry the fruit or vegetable, in which case one need not wash their hands before eating the fruit or vegetable.\n\nAccording to most traditions, no blessing is recited at this point in the Seder, unlike the blessing recited over the washing of the hands before eating bread.  However, followers of [[Rambam]] or the [[Gaon of Vilna]] do recite a blessing.\n\n===''Karpas'' (appetizer)===\nEach participant dips a vegetable into either ''salt water'' (Ashkenazi custom; said to serve as a reminder of the tears shed by their enslaved ancestors), ''vinegar'' (Sephardi custom) or ''[[charoset]]'' (older Sephardi custom; still common among Yemenite Jews). Another custom mentioned in some Ashkenazi sources and probably originating with [[Meir of Rothenburg]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} was to dip the karpas in ''wine''.\n\n===''Yachatz'' (breaking of the middle matzah)===\nThree [[matzot]] are stacked on the seder table; at this stage, the middle matzah of the three is broken in half. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the ''[[afikoman]]'', the \"dessert\" after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzot.\n\n===''Magid'' (relating the Exodus)===\nThe story of Passover, and the change from slavery to freedom is told. At this point in the Seder, Moroccan Jews have a custom of raising the Seder plate over the heads of all those present while chanting \"Bivhilu yatzanu mimitzrayim, halahma anya b'nei horin\" (In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people).\n\n==== ''Ha Lachma Anya'' (invitation to the Seder) ====\n{{Main|Ha Lachma Anya}}\n[[File:Maurice Ascalon Pal-Bell Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A bronze [[matzo]] plate designed by [[Maurice Ascalon]], inscribed with the opening words of ''Ha Lachma Anya'']]\nThe [[matzo]]t are uncovered, and referred to as the \"bread of affliction\". Participants declare (in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) an invitation to all who are hungry or needy to join in the Seder. [[Halakha]] requires that this invitation be repeated in the native language of the country.\n\n==== ''Mah Nishtanah'' (The Four Questions) ====\n{{Main|the four questions}}\n\nThe [[Mishna]] details questions one is obligated to ask on the night of the seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions.<ref name=jewfaq>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult \"child\" until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant.<ref name=pesachim116>Talmud Bavli, Pesachim, 116a</ref> The need to ask is so great that even if a person is alone at the seder they are obligated to ask themselves and to answer their own questions.<ref name=pesachim116 />\n\n''Ma nishtana ha lyla ha zeh mikkol hallaylot?''<br>\nWhy is this night different from all other nights?\n\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin \u1e25amets umatsa, vehallayla hazze kullo matsa.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat either leavened bread or matza, but on this night we eat only matza?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin sh'ar y'rakot, vehallayla hazze maror.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot en anu matbillin afillu pa'am e\u1e25at, vehallayla hazze sh'tei fe'amim.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip [our food] even once, but on this night we dip them twice?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin ben yosh'vin uven m'subbin, vehallayla hazze kullanu m'subbin.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we dine either sitting upright or reclining, but on this night we all recline?\n\nThe second question substitutes for a different question, present in the mishnah but removed by later authorities due to its inapplicability after the [[destruction of the temple]]:\n# <li value=\"5\"> ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin basar tsali shaluk umvushal, vehallayla hazze kullo tsali.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we eat meat either roasted, marinated, or cooked, but on this night it is entirely roasted?</li>\n\nRoasted sacrifices were no longer possible after the destruction, and roasted meat was therefore disallowed on seder night, to avoid ambiguity.\n\nThe questions are answered with the following:\n# We eat only matzah because our ancestors could not wait for their breads to rise when they were fleeing slavery in Egypt, and so they were flat when they came out of the oven.\n# We eat only Maror, a bitter herb, to remind us of the bitterness of slavery that our ancestors endured while in Egypt.\n# The first dip, green vegetables in salt water, symbolizes the replacing of our tears with gratitude, and the second dip, Maror in Charoses, symbolizes the sweetening of our burden of bitterness and suffering.\n# We recline at the Seder table because in ancient times, a person who reclined at a meal was a free person, while slaves and servants stood.\n# We eat only roasted meat because that is how the Pesach/Passover lamb is prepared during sacrifice in the Temple at Jerusalem.\n\nThe four questions have been translated into over 300 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whyisthisnight.com |title=300 Ways to Ask The Four Questions |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==== The Four Sons ====\nThe traditional Haggadah speaks of \"four sons\" \u2013 one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know to ask. This is based upon the rabbis of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] finding four references in the Torah to responding to your son who asks a question.<ref name=\"Bazak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |title=The Four Sons |last=Bazak |first=Rav Amnon |others=David Silverberg (trans.) |work=Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash |publisher=Yeshivat Har Etzion |accessdate=12 March 2013 |location=Alon Shvut, Israel |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518205620/http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}</ref> Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.\n\nThe wise son asks \"What are the statutes, the testimonies, and the laws that God has commanded us to do?\"  One explanation for why this very detailed-oriented question is categorized as wise, is that the wise son is trying to learn how to carry out the seder, rather than asking for someone else's understanding of its meaning. He is answered fully:\n\"You should reply to him with [all] the laws of pesach: one may not eat any dessert after the paschal sacrifice.\"\n\nThe wicked son, who asks, \"What is this service to you?\", is characterized by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that \"It is because God acted for ''my'' sake when ''I'' left Egypt.\" (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.\n\nThe simple son, who asks, \"What is this?\" is answered with \"With a strong hand the Almighty led us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.\"\n\nAnd the one who does not know to ask is told, \"It is because of what the Almighty did for me when I left Egypt.\"\n\nSome modern Haggadahs mention \"children\" instead of \"sons\", and some have added a fifth child. The fifth child can represent the children of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] who did not survive to ask a question<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haggadot.com/clips/csjo-fifth-child |title=CSJO: Fifth Child |publisher=Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations |accessdate=2011-10-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or represent [[Jews]] who have drifted so far from Jewish life that they do not participate in a Seder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |title=Jewish Holidays > Pesach |publisher=Kolel |accessdate=2011-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108024133/http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |archive-date=2011-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the former, tradition is to say that for that child we ask \"Why?\" and, like the simple child, we have no answer.\n\n==== \"Go and learn\" ====\nFour verses in [[Deuteronomy]] (26:5\u20138) are then expounded, with an elaborate, traditional commentary. (\"5. And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God: 'A wandering Aramean was my parent, and they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 6. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt [[with a strong hand and an outstretched arm]], and with great terribleness, and with [[signs and wonders|signs, and with wonders]].\")\n\nThe Haggadah explores the meaning of those verses, and embellishes the story. This telling describes the slavery of the Jewish people and their miraculous salvation by God. This culminates in an enumeration of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]]:\n\n# ''Dam'' (blood) \u2013 All the water was changed to blood\n# ''Tzefardeyah'' (frogs) \u2013 An infestation of frogs sprang up in Egypt\n# ''Kinim'' (lice) \u2013 The [[Egyptians]] were afflicted by [[louse|lice]]\n# ''Arov'' (wild animals) \u2013 An infestation of wild animals (some say flies) sprang up in Egypt\n# ''Dever'' (pestilence) \u2013 A plague killed off the Egyptian livestock\n# ''Sh'chin'' (boils) \u2013 An epidemic of [[boil]]s afflicted the Egyptians\n# ''Barad'' (hail) \u2013 Hail rained from the sky\n# ''Arbeh'' (locusts) \u2013 Locusts swarmed over Egypt\n# ''Choshech'' (darkness) \u2013 Egypt was covered in darkness\n# ''Makkat Bechorot'' (killing of the first-born) \u2013 All the first-born sons of the Egyptians were slain by God\n\nWith the recital of the Ten Plagues, each participant removes a drop of wine from his or her cup using a fingertip. Although this night is one of salvation, [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] explains that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God's creatures had to suffer.<ref>Klein, Isaac.  ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice''.  New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1992.  Print.  p. 126</ref> A [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] for the plagues is also introduced: \"D'tzach Adash B'achav\", while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.\n\nAt this part in the Seder, songs of praise are sung, including the song ''[[Dayenu]]'', which proclaims that had God performed any single one of the many deeds performed for the Jewish people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. Some sing instead ''The Women's Dayenu'', a feminist variant of ''Dayenu'', by [[Michele Landsberg]].<ref>http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women\u2019s-dayenu/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410111232/http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women%E2%80%99s-dayenu/ |date=2015-04-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |title=To the pulpit by way of the classroom &#124; NJJN |publisher=Njjewishnews.com |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2015-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401235732/http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |archive-date=2015-04-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Dayenu'' is a declaration (mandated by Rabban Gamliel) of the reasons of the commandments of the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal lamb]], [[Matzah]], and [[Maror]], with scriptural sources. Then follows a short prayer, and the recital of the first two psalms of [[Hallel]] (which will be concluded after the meal). A long blessing is recited, and the second cup of wine is drunk.\n\n===''Rohtzah'' (ritual washing of hands)===\nThe ritual hand-washing is repeated, this time with all customs including a blessing.\n\n===''Motzi'' (blessings over the Matzah)===\nTwo blessings are recited.\n\nFirst one recites the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words \"who brings forth\" (motzi in Hebrew).<ref name=\"FamilyHaggadah\">{{Cite book|editor1-first=Nosson|editor1-last=Scherman|editor2-first=Meir|editor2-last=Zlotowitz|title=The Family Haggadah|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd.|origyear=1981|year=1994|isbn=978-0-89906-178-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/familyhaggadahha0000unse}}</ref>\n\n===''Matzah''===\nThen one recites the blessing regarding the commandment to eat Matzah.\n\nAn olive-size piece (some say two) is then eaten while reclining to the left.\n\n===''Maror'' (bitter herbs)===\nThe blessing for the eating of the maror (bitter herbs) is recited and then it is to be eaten.<ref name=\"FamilyHaggadah\"/>\n\n===''Korech'' (sandwich)===\nThe maror (bitter herb) is placed between two small pieces of matzo, similarly to how the contents of a sandwich are placed between two slices of bread, and eaten.

After the consumption of the ''afikoman'', traditionally, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.\n\n===''Bareich'' (Grace after Meals)===\nThe recital of [[Birkat Hamazon]].\n\n==== ''Kos Shlishi'' (the Third Cup of Wine) ====\nThe drinking of the Third Cup of Wine.\n\nNote: The Third Cup is customarily poured before the [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace after Meals]] is recited because the Third Cup also serves as a [[Birkat Hamazon#Cup of Blessing|Cup of Blessing]] associated with the Grace after Meals on special occasions.\n\n==== ''Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi'' (cup of Elijah the Prophet); Miriam's cup ====\nIn many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point. [[Psalms]] 79:6\u20137 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 3:66 among Ashkenazim.\n\nMost Ashkenazim have the custom to fill a fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic discussion that concerns the number of cups that are supposed to be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6\u20137, some rabbis felt that it was important to include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which \u2013 by this stage \u2013 was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until [[Elijah]] (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the ''Kos shel Eliyahu'' (\"Cup of Elijah\"). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the [[Moshiach|Jewish Messiah]].\n\nSome seders (including the original Women's Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam.<ref name=\"miriamscup.com\">[http://www.miriamscup.com/RitualFirst.htm Miriam's Cup: Miriam's Cup rituals for the family Passover seder].

The first two psalms, [[Psalm 113|113]] and [[Psalm 114|114]], were recited before the meal.  The remaining psalms [[Psalm 115|115]]\u2013[[Psalm 118|118]], are recited at this point. [[Psalm 136]] (the Great Hallel) is then recited, followed by ''[[Nishmat]]'', a portion of the morning service for Shabbat and festivals.\n\nThere are a number of opinions concerning the paragraph ''Yehalelukha'' which normally follows Hallel, and ''[[Yishtabakh]]'', which normally follows ''Nishmat''. Most Ashkenazim recite ''Yehalelukha'' immediately following the Hallel proper, i.e. at the end of Psalm 118, except for the concluding words. After Nishmat, they recite ''Yishtabakh'' in its entirety.  Sephardim recite '\"Yehalelukha'' alone after Nishmat.\n\nAfterwards the Fourth Cup of Wine is drunk and a brief Grace for the \"fruit of the vine\" is said.\n\n===''Nirtzah''===\n{{Main|Passover songs}}\nThe Seder concludes with a prayer that the night's service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: \"''[[L'shanah haba'ah]] b'Yerushalayim!'' \u2013 [[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\" Jews in [[Israel]], and especially those in [[Jerusalem]], recite instead \"''L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim hab'nuyah!'' \u2013 Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!\" Jerusalem is the holiest city in the Bible; it has become symbolic of the idea of spiritual perfection.  The tradition of saying \"Next year in Jerusalem\" is similar to the tradition of opening the door for Elijah: it recognizes that \u201cthis year\u201d we live in an imperfect world outside of \u201cJerusalem,\u201d but we patiently await a time, hopefully \u201cnext year,\u201d in which we live in spiritual perfection.<ref>Kolatch, Alfred J.  ''The Family Seder: A Traditional Passover Haggadah For the Modern Home''.  New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1991.  Print.  p. 99.</ref>\n\nAlthough the 15 orders of the Seder have been complete, the Haggadah concludes with additional songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]] will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is ''Chad Gadya'' (\"One Kid Goat\"). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the [[Vilna Gaon]] as an [[allegory]] to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people at the end of days.\n\nFollowing the Seder, those who are still awake may recite the [[Song of Songs]], engage in Torah learning, or continue talking about the events of the Exodus until sleep overtakes them.\n\n==Non-traditional Seders==\n\n===Feminist Seders===\nIn 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in [[E.

The first of these, the ''Freedom Seder,'' was written by [[Arthur Waskow]], published in ''Ramparts'' magazine and in a small booklet by the Micah Press and in a later edition (1970) by Holt-Rinehart-Winston, and was actually performed on April 4, 1969, the first anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.and the third night of Passover, at Lincoln Memorial Temple in Washington, DC. It celebrated the liberation struggle of Black America alongside that of ancient Israel from Pharaoh, and was the first Haggadah to go beyond the original Biblical story. It sparked a large number of Haggadahs celebrating various other forms of liberation \u2013 feminism, vegetarianism, the liberation movements in Latin America in the 1970s, ecological healing, etc.. <!--{{See Waskow's book ''Godwrestling -- Round 2.''}}--> Today, many [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregations hold annual interfaith community Seders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe|title=Unitarian Universalists have diverse and inclusive beliefs|date=9 February 2015|website=UUA.org}}</ref> A number of Interfaith Passover Seder [[Haggadah]]s have been written especially for this purpose.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===White House Passover Seder===\n{{main|White House Passover Seder}}\n\n[[File:Barack Obama hosts a Seder dinner 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Obamas host the first [[White House Passover Seder]] in 2009 (White House photo).]]\nIn 2009 President [[Barack Obama]] began conducting an annual Passover seder in the [[Family Dining Room#2015 Obama redecoration|Old Family Dining Room]] of the [[White House]], marking the first time that a sitting US president hosted a Seder in the White House.<ref name=huff>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/white-house-seder-_n_5146629.html|title=How Three Jewish Junior Obama Staffers Brought The First Passover Seder to the White House|first= Paul Brandeis |last=Raushenbush|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=cs>{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2013/0325/Why-Obama-a-Christian-hosts-a-Passover-seder-each-year-at-White-House|title= Why Obama, a Christian, hosts a Passover seder each year at White House|first=David T.|last=Cook|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref> The private dinner for about 20 guests,<ref name=for>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/news/173508/how-is-the-white-house-seder-different-from-all-ot/|title=How is the White House Seder Different from All Others?|first=Devra|last=Ferst|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> both Jewish and non-Jewish \u2013 including the President and his family, members of the President's and First Lady's staffs, and friends and their families<ref name=hill>{{cite web |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237766-israeli-relations-put-focus-on-white-house-seder|title= Iran deal, Israeli tensions put focus on White House Seder|first=Jordan|last=Fabian|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref> \u2013 features the reading of the Haggadah, traditional rituals such as the hiding of the afikoman and the cup of Elijah, and the reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=huff/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jewish holidays]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|title=A Passover Seder Companion and Analytic Introduction to the Haggadah|first=Martin|last=Sicker|year=2004|isbn=978-0595313693}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Passover Seder}}\n* [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-passover-pesach-seder/ My Jewish Learning: The Passover (Pesach) Seder]\n* [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1980/jewish/passover-seder.htm/ Chabad.org: The Passover Seder]\n\n{{Wikibooks|Passover Haggadah/Kadesh}}\n{{Wikibooks|Passover Haggadah}}\n\n{{Jewish and Israeli holidays}}\n\n[[Category:Passover seder| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish festive meals]]\n[[Category:Jewish law and rituals]]\n[[Category:Jewish sacrificial law]]\n[[Category:Hallel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Seder}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|image = Sedertable.jpg\n|caption = Table set for the Passover Seder\n|observedby = '''[[Jews]]'''.

It is conducted throughout the world on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (with a calendar day reckoned to start at sunset).  The day falls in late March or in April of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the Passover lasts for 7 days in Israel and 8 days outside Israel. Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many Diaspora communities hold a seder also on the second night. The Seder is a ritual performed by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling of the story of the liberation of the [[Israelites]] from [[slavery]] in [[ancient Egypt]].  This story is in the [[Book of Exodus]] (''Shemot'') in The [[Hebrew Bible]].  The Seder itself is based on the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] verse [[613 Mitzvot|commanding]] Jews to retell the story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]: \"You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what [[Tetragrammaton|the LORD]] did for me when I came out of Egypt.'\" (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the [[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]], an ancient work derived from the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Pesahim]]'' 10).<ref>\"Haggadah, Passover.\" Ernst Goldschmidt, Bezalel Narkiss, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Robert Weltsch, Bezalel Narkiss, Joseph Gutmann, Cecil Roth, Hanoch Avenary, and Jody Myers.

It is customary to invite guests, especially strangers and the needy. The Seder is integral to Jewish faith and identity: as explained in the Haggadah, if not for [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and the Exodus, the Jewish people would still be [[slaves]] in Egypt. Therefore, the Seder is an occasion for praise and thanksgiving and for re-dedication to the idea of liberation. Furthermore, the words and rituals of the Seder are a primary vehicle for the transmission of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] from grandparent to child, and from one generation to the next. Attending a Seder and eating matza on Passover is a widespread custom in the Jewish community, even among those who are not religiously observant.\n\n[[File:1850ukr pesah.jpg|thumb|265px|A Ukrainian 19th-century [[lubok]] representing the Seder table]]\nThe Seder table is traditionally set with the finest place settings and silverware, and family members come to the table dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a [[kittel]].<ref name=MB>Mishnah Berurah, 472:13</ref><ref name=Eider>{{Cite book|last=Eider |first=Shimon |authorlink=Shimon Eider |title=Halachos of Pesach |publisher=Feldheim publishers |isbn=978-0-87306-864-2|year=1998 }}</ref> For the first half of the Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine glass. At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three [[matzo]]t and dishes of salt water for dipping.\n\nEach participant receives a copy of the Haggadah, which is often a traditional version: an ancient text that contains the complete Seder service. Men and women are equally obliged and eligible to participate in the Seder.<ref name=chinuch>sefer hachinuch, mi tzvah 21</ref> In many homes, each participant at the Seder table will recite at least critical parts of the Haggadah in the original Hebrew and Aramaic. [[Halakha]]h requires that certain parts be said in language the participants can understand, and critical parts are often said in both Hebrew and the native language. The leader will often interrupt the reading to discuss different points with his or her children, or to offer a Torah insight into the meaning or interpretation of the words.\n\nIn some homes, participants take turns reciting the text of the Haggadah, in the original Hebrew or in translation. It is traditional for the head of the household and other participants to have pillows placed behind them for added comfort. At several points during the Seder, participants lean to the left \u2013 when drinking the four cups of wine, eating the Afikoman, and eating the korech sandwich.<ref name=Eider />\n\nJews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]] communities, sometimes excluding [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews, hold a seder also on the second night. Seders have been observed around the world, including in remote places such as high in the Himalaya mountains in [[Kathmandu, Nepal]].<ref>April 14, 2014, Israel National News, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/291149#.U6ixzpRX9pA Volunteers Save Kathmandu Seder], Accessed June 22, 2014, \"...Chabad house, which is expecting over 1,000 people for Monday night's seder...\"</ref><ref>April 15th, 2014, Global Post, [http://www.globalpost.com/photo-galleries/planet-pic/6122264/kathmandu-jerusalem-how-jews-around-the-world-are-celebrating-passover From Kathmandu to Jerusalem, how Jews around the world are celebrating Passover], Accessed June 28, 2014</ref>\n\n==Themes of the Seder==\n\n===Slavery and freedom===\n[[File:Matzah.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Machine-made [[matzo]]]]\nThe rituals and symbolic foods evoke the twin themes of the evening: slavery and freedom. It is stated in the Hagaddah that \"In every generation everyone is obligated to see themselves as if they themselves came out of Egypt\" \u2013 i.e., out of slavery.\n\nThe rendering of time for the Hebrews was that a day began at sunset and ended at sunset. Historically, at the beginning of the 15th of [[Nisan]] in Ancient Egypt, the Jewish people were enslaved to Pharaoh. After the [[Plagues of Egypt#Death of Firstborn (11:1 - 12:36) \u05de\u05b7\u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea|tenth plague]] struck Egypt at midnight, killing all the first-born sons from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the lowest Egyptian to all the first-born of the livestock in the land (Exodus 12:29), Pharaoh let the Hebrew nation go, effectively making them free people for the second half of the night.\n\nThus, Seder participants recall the slavery that reigned during the first half of the night by eating [[matzo]] (the \"poor person's bread\"), [[maror]] (bitter herbs which symbolize the bitterness of slavery), and charoset (a sweet paste representing the mortar which the Jewish slaves used to cement bricks). Recalling the freedom of the second half of the night, they eat the matzo (the \"bread of freedom\" as well as the \"bread of affliction\") and '[[afikoman]]', and drink the four cups of wine, in a reclining position, and dip vegetables into salt water (the dipping being a sign of royalty and freedom).\n\n===The Four Cups===\nThere is an obligation to drink four cups of wine during the Seder. The [[Mishnah]] says ([[Pesachim|Pes.]] 10:1) that even the poor are obliged to drink the four cups. Each cup is imbibed at a specific point in the Seder. The first is for [[Kiddush]] (\u05e7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9), the second is for '[[Maggid]]' (\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3), the third is for [[Birkat Hamazon]] (\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d5\u05df) and the fourth is for [[Hallel]] (\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc).<ref name=\"Marcus\">{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Yossef |title=What is the significance of the four cups of wine? |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |work=Chabad |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421031844/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/658520/jewish/What-is-the-significance-of-the-four-cups.htm |archivedate=21 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Seder in a Nutshell |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |work=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317234258/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1751/jewish/The-Seder-in-a-Nutshell.htm |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}</ref>\n[[File:Pessach Pesach Pascha Judentum Ungesaeuert Seder datafox.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Passover Seder table]]\n[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Traditional arrangement of symbolic foods on a Passover Seder plate]]\n\nThe Four Cups represent the four expressions of deliverance promised by God {{bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}: \"I will bring out,\" \"I will deliver,\" \"I will redeem,\" and \"I will take.\"<ref name=\"Marcus\"/>\n\nThe [[Vilna Gaon]] relates the Four Cups to four worlds: this world, the [[Messiah|Messianic]] age, the world at the revival of the dead, and the [[world to come]]. The [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|MaHaRaL]] connects them to the four Matriarchs: [[Sarah]], [[Rebeccah]], [[Rachel]], and [[Leah]]. (The three [[matzo]]t, in turn, are connected to the three Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) [[Isaac Abrabanel|Abarbanel]] relates the cups to the four historical redemptions of the Jewish people: the choosing of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt, the survival of the Jewish people throughout the exile, and the fourth which will happen at the end of days.\n\nThe four cups might also reflect the Roman custom of drinking as many cups as there are letters in the name of the chief guest at a meal, which in the case of the Seder is God Himself whose Hebrew name has four letters.<ref>{{cite web|title=OzTorah: Four Cups of Wine|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2012/04/four-cups-of-wine/|work=Oztorah.com|publisher=Rabbi Raymond Apple|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Seder plate===\n\nThe special Passover Seder plate (''ke'are'') is a special plate containing symbolic foods used during the Passover Seder. Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The seventh symbolic item used during the meal \u2013 a stack of three matzot \u2013 is placed on its own plate on the Seder table.\n\nThe six items on the Seder plate are:\n* ''[[Maror]]'': Bitter herbs, symbolizing the bitterness and harshness of the slavery which the Jews endured in Ancient Egypt. For ''maror'', many people use freshly grated horseradish or whole horseradish root.\n* ''Chazeret'' is typically romaine lettuce, whose roots are bitter-tasting. In addition to horseradish and romaine lettuce, other forms of bitter lettuce, such as [[endive]], may be eaten in fulfillment of the [[mitzvah]], as well as green onions, dandelion greens, celery leaves, or curly parsley (but parsley and celery are more commonly used as the karpas or vegetable element).  Much depends upon whether one's tradition is Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrahi, Persian, or one of the many other Jewish ethno-cultural traditions.\n* ''[[Charoset]]'': A sweet, brown, pebbly paste of fruits and nuts, representing the mortar used by the Jewish slaves to build the storehouses of Egypt.  The actual recipe depends partly on ethno-cultural tradition and partly on locally available ingredients.  Ashkenazi Jews, for example, traditionally make apple-raisin based charoset while Sephardic Jews often make date-based recipes that might feature orange or/and lemon, or even banana.\n* ''[[Karpas]]'': A vegetable other than bitter herbs, usually parsley but sometimes something such as [[celery]] or cooked [[potato]], which is dipped into salt water (Ashkenazi custom), vinegar (Sephardi custom), or [[charoset]] (older custom, still common amongst [[Yemenite Jews]]) at the beginning of the Seder.\n* ''[[Zeroa]]'': A roasted lamb or goat bone, symbolizing the ''korban Pesach'' (Pesach sacrifice), which was a lamb offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.\n* ''Beitzah'': A roast egg \u2013 usually a [[hard-boiled egg]] that has been roasted in a baking pan with a little oil, or with a lamb shank \u2013 symbolizing the ''korban chagigah'' (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and was then eaten as part of the meal on Seder night.\n\n===Focus on the children===\nSince the retelling of the Exodus to one's child is the object of the Seder experience, much effort is made to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children and keep them awake during the meal. To that end, questions and answers are a central device in the Seder ritual. By encouraging children to ask questions, they will be more open to hearing the answers.\n\nThe most famous question which the youngest child asks at the Seder is the \"''[[Ma Nishtana]]''\" \u2013 'Why is this night different from all other nights?' After the asking of this questions, the main portion of the Seder, ''Magid'', discusses the answers in the form of a historical review. Also, at different points in the Seder, the leader of the Seder will cover the matzot and lift their cup of wine; then put down the cup of wine and uncover the matzot \u2013 all to elicit questions from the children.<ref name=manishtana>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\nIn Sephardic tradition, the questions are asked by the assembled company in chorus rather than by a child, and are put to the leader of the seder, who either answers the question or may direct the attention of the assembled company to someone who is acting out that particular part of the Exodus.  Physical re-enactment of the Exodus during the Passover seder is common in many families and communities, especially amongst Sephardim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/sephardicpassovercustoms.html|title=Sephardic Passover (Pesach) Customs and Traditions|website=www.angelfire.com}}</ref>\n\nFamilies will follow the Haggadah's lead by asking their own questions at various points in the Haggadah and offering prizes such as nuts and candies for correct answers. The ''[[afikoman]]'', which is hidden away for the \"dessert\" after the meal, is another device used to encourage children's participation. In some families, the leader of the Seder hides the ''afikoman'' and the children must find it, whereupon they receive a prize or reward. In other homes, the children hide the ''afikoman'' and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize (often money) for revealing its location.\n\n==Order of the Seder==\nThe order and procedures of the Seder are stated and printed in the text of the Passover [[Haggadah]], a copy of which is in front of all participants. Jewish children learn the following words, denoting the order of the Seder, with a rhyme and tune at their Jewish schools:\n\n{{quote|[[#Kadeish (blessings and the first cup of wine)|Kaddesh]] ({{lang|he|\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9}}).

It should be recited as soon as the synagogue services are over but not before nightfall.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" /> This ''Kiddush'' is similar to that which is recited on all of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], but also refers to [[matzot]] and the exodus from Egypt. Acting in a way that shows freedom and majesty, many Jews have the custom of filling each other's cups at the Seder table. The Kiddush is traditionally said by the father of the house, but all Seder participants may participate by reciting the Kiddush and drinking at least a majority of the first cup of wine.\n\n===''Urchatz'' (wash hands)===\nTechnically, according to [[Jewish law]], whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one's hands if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, at other times of the year, one has either already washed their hands before eating bread, or dry the fruit or vegetable, in which case one need not wash their hands before eating the fruit or vegetable.\n\nAccording to most traditions, no blessing is recited at this point in the Seder, unlike the blessing recited over the washing of the hands before eating bread.  However, followers of [[Rambam]] or the [[Gaon of Vilna]] do recite a blessing.\n\n===''Karpas'' (appetizer)===\nEach participant dips a vegetable into either ''salt water'' (Ashkenazi custom; said to serve as a reminder of the tears shed by their enslaved ancestors), ''vinegar'' (Sephardi custom) or ''[[charoset]]'' (older Sephardi custom; still common among Yemenite Jews). Another custom mentioned in some Ashkenazi sources and probably originating with [[Meir of Rothenburg]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} was to dip the karpas in ''wine''.\n\n===''Yachatz'' (breaking of the middle matzah)===\nThree [[matzot]] are stacked on the seder table; at this stage, the middle matzah of the three is broken in half. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the ''[[afikoman]]'', the \"dessert\" after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzot.\n\n===''Magid'' (relating the Exodus)===\nThe story of Passover, and the change from slavery to freedom is told. At this point in the Seder, Moroccan Jews have a custom of raising the Seder plate over the heads of all those present while chanting \"Bivhilu yatzanu mimitzrayim, halahma anya b'nei horin\" (In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people).\n\n==== ''Ha Lachma Anya'' (invitation to the Seder) ====\n{{Main|Ha Lachma Anya}}\n[[File:Maurice Ascalon Pal-Bell Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A bronze [[matzo]] plate designed by [[Maurice Ascalon]], inscribed with the opening words of ''Ha Lachma Anya'']]\nThe [[matzo]]t are uncovered, and referred to as the \"bread of affliction\". Participants declare (in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) an invitation to all who are hungry or needy to join in the Seder. [[Halakha]] requires that this invitation be repeated in the native language of the country.\n\n==== ''Mah Nishtanah'' (The Four Questions) ====\n{{Main|the four questions}}\n\nThe [[Mishna]] details questions one is obligated to ask on the night of the seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions.<ref name=jewfaq>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm |title=Judaism 101: Pesach Seder: How is This Night Different |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult \"child\" until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant.<ref name=pesachim116>Talmud Bavli, Pesachim, 116a</ref> The need to ask is so great that even if a person is alone at the seder they are obligated to ask themselves and to answer their own questions.<ref name=pesachim116 />\n\n''Ma nishtana ha lyla ha zeh mikkol hallaylot?''<br>\nWhy is this night different from all other nights?\n\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin \u1e25amets umatsa, vehallayla hazze kullo matsa.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat either leavened bread or matza, but on this night we eat only matza?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin sh'ar y'rakot, vehallayla hazze maror.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot en anu matbillin afillu pa'am e\u1e25at, vehallayla hazze sh'tei fe'amim.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip [our food] even once, but on this night we dip them twice?\n# ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin ben yosh'vin uven m'subbin, vehallayla hazze kullanu m'subbin.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we dine either sitting upright or reclining, but on this night we all recline?\n\nThe second question substitutes for a different question, present in the mishnah but removed by later authorities due to its inapplicability after the [[destruction of the temple]]:\n# <li value=\"5\"> ''Shebb'khol hallelot anu okh'lin basar tsali shaluk umvushal, vehallayla hazze kullo tsali.''<br>Why is it that on all other nights we eat meat either roasted, marinated, or cooked, but on this night it is entirely roasted?</li>\n\nRoasted sacrifices were no longer possible after the destruction, and roasted meat was therefore disallowed on seder night, to avoid ambiguity.\n\nThe questions are answered with the following:\n# We eat only matzah because our ancestors could not wait for their breads to rise when they were fleeing slavery in Egypt, and so they were flat when they came out of the oven.\n# We eat only Maror, a bitter herb, to remind us of the bitterness of slavery that our ancestors endured while in Egypt.\n# The first dip, green vegetables in salt water, symbolizes the replacing of our tears with gratitude, and the second dip, Maror in Charoses, symbolizes the sweetening of our burden of bitterness and suffering.\n# We recline at the Seder table because in ancient times, a person who reclined at a meal was a free person, while slaves and servants stood.\n# We eat only roasted meat because that is how the Pesach/Passover lamb is prepared during sacrifice in the Temple at Jerusalem.\n\nThe four questions have been translated into over 300 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whyisthisnight.com |title=300 Ways to Ask The Four Questions |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==== The Four Sons ====\nThe traditional Haggadah speaks of \"four sons\" \u2013 one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know to ask. This is based upon the rabbis of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] finding four references in the Torah to responding to your son who asks a question.<ref name=\"Bazak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |title=The Four Sons |last=Bazak |first=Rav Amnon |others=David Silverberg (trans.) |work=Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash |publisher=Yeshivat Har Etzion |accessdate=12 March 2013 |location=Alon Shvut, Israel |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518205620/http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes68-ab.htm |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}</ref> Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.\n\nThe wise son asks \"What are the statutes, the testimonies, and the laws that God has commanded us to do?\"  One explanation for why this very detailed-oriented question is categorized as wise, is that the wise son is trying to learn how to carry out the seder, rather than asking for someone else's understanding of its meaning. He is answered fully:\n\"You should reply to him with [all] the laws of pesach: one may not eat any dessert after the paschal sacrifice.\"\n\nThe wicked son, who asks, \"What is this service to you?\", is characterized by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that \"It is because God acted for ''my'' sake when ''I'' left Egypt.\" (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.\n\nThe simple son, who asks, \"What is this?\" is answered with \"With a strong hand the Almighty led us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.\"\n\nAnd the one who does not know to ask is told, \"It is because of what the Almighty did for me when I left Egypt.\"\n\nSome modern Haggadahs mention \"children\" instead of \"sons\", and some have added a fifth child. The fifth child can represent the children of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] who did not survive to ask a question<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haggadot.com/clips/csjo-fifth-child |title=CSJO: Fifth Child |publisher=Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations |accessdate=2011-10-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or represent [[Jews]] who have drifted so far from Jewish life that they do not participate in a Seder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |title=Jewish Holidays > Pesach |publisher=Kolel |accessdate=2011-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108024133/http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |archive-date=2011-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the former, tradition is to say that for that child we ask \"Why?\" and, like the simple child, we have no answer.\n\n==== \"Go and learn\" ====\nFour verses in [[Deuteronomy]] (26:5\u20138) are then expounded, with an elaborate, traditional commentary. (\"5. And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God: 'A wandering Aramean was my parent, and they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 6. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt [[with a strong hand and an outstretched arm]], and with great terribleness, and with [[signs and wonders|signs, and with wonders]].\")\n\nThe Haggadah explores the meaning of those verses, and embellishes the story. This telling describes the slavery of the Jewish people and their miraculous salvation by God. This culminates in an enumeration of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]]:\n\n# ''Dam'' (blood) \u2013 All the water was changed to blood\n# ''Tzefardeyah'' (frogs) \u2013 An infestation of frogs sprang up in Egypt\n# ''Kinim'' (lice) \u2013 The [[Egyptians]] were afflicted by [[louse|lice]]\n# ''Arov'' (wild animals) \u2013 An infestation of wild animals (some say flies) sprang up in Egypt\n# ''Dever'' (pestilence) \u2013 A plague killed off the Egyptian livestock\n# ''Sh'chin'' (boils) \u2013 An epidemic of [[boil]]s afflicted the Egyptians\n# ''Barad'' (hail) \u2013 Hail rained from the sky\n# ''Arbeh'' (locusts) \u2013 Locusts swarmed over Egypt\n# ''Choshech'' (darkness) \u2013 Egypt was covered in darkness\n# ''Makkat Bechorot'' (killing of the first-born) \u2013 All the first-born sons of the Egyptians were slain by God\n\nWith the recital of the Ten Plagues, each participant removes a drop of wine from his or her cup using a fingertip. Although this night is one of salvation, [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] explains that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God's creatures had to suffer.<ref>Klein, Isaac.  ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice''.  New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1992.  Print.  p. 126</ref> A [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] for the plagues is also introduced: \"D'tzach Adash B'achav\", while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.\n\nAt this part in the Seder, songs of praise are sung, including the song ''[[Dayenu]]'', which proclaims that had God performed any single one of the many deeds performed for the Jewish people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. Some sing instead ''The Women's Dayenu'', a feminist variant of ''Dayenu'', by [[Michele Landsberg]].<ref>http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women\u2019s-dayenu/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410111232/http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women%E2%80%99s-dayenu/ |date=2015-04-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |title=To the pulpit by way of the classroom &#124; NJJN |publisher=Njjewishnews.com |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2015-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401235732/http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |archive-date=2015-04-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Dayenu'' is a declaration (mandated by Rabban Gamliel) of the reasons of the commandments of the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal lamb]], [[Matzah]], and [[Maror]], with scriptural sources. Then follows a short prayer, and the recital of the first two psalms of [[Hallel]] (which will be concluded after the meal). A long blessing is recited, and the second cup of wine is drunk.\n\n===''Rohtzah'' (ritual washing of hands)===\nThe ritual hand-washing is repeated, this time with all customs including a blessing.\n\n===''Motzi'' (blessings over the Matzah)===\nTwo blessings are recited.\n\nFirst one recites the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words \"who brings forth\" (motzi in Hebrew).<ref name=\"FamilyHaggadah\">{{Cite book|editor1-first=Nosson|editor1-last=Scherman|editor2-first=Meir|editor2-last=Zlotowitz|title=The Family Haggadah|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd.|origyear=1981|year=1994|isbn=978-0-89906-178-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/familyhaggadahha0000unse}}</ref>\n\n===''Matzah''===\nThen one recites the blessing regarding the commandment to eat Matzah.\n\nAn olive-size piece (some say two) is then eaten while reclining to the left.\n\n===''Maror'' (bitter herbs)===\nThe blessing for the eating of the maror (bitter herbs) is recited and then it is to be eaten.<ref name=\"FamilyHaggadah\"/>\n\n===''Korech'' (sandwich)===\nThe maror (bitter herb) is placed between two small pieces of matzo, similarly to how the contents of a sandwich are placed between two slices of bread, and eaten. This follows the tradition of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], who did the same at his Seder table 2000 years ago (except that in Hillel's day the Paschal sacrifice, matzo, and maror were eaten together.)\n\n===''Shulchan Orech'' (the meal)===\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting]]\nThe festive meal is eaten. Traditionally it begins with the charred egg on the Seder plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard.asp?AID=117122 |title=Chabad.org: 11.

After the consumption of the ''afikoman'', traditionally, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.\n\n===''Bareich'' (Grace after Meals)===\nThe recital of [[Birkat Hamazon]].\n\n==== ''Kos Shlishi'' (the Third Cup of Wine) ====\nThe drinking of the Third Cup of Wine.\n\nNote: The Third Cup is customarily poured before the [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace after Meals]] is recited because the Third Cup also serves as a [[Birkat Hamazon#Cup of Blessing|Cup of Blessing]] associated with the Grace after Meals on special occasions.\n\n==== ''Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi'' (cup of Elijah the Prophet); Miriam's cup ====\nIn many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point. [[Psalms]] 79:6\u20137 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 3:66 among Ashkenazim.\n\nMost Ashkenazim have the custom to fill a fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic discussion that concerns the number of cups that are supposed to be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6\u20137, some rabbis felt that it was important to include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which \u2013 by this stage \u2013 was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until [[Elijah]] (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the ''Kos shel Eliyahu'' (\"Cup of Elijah\"). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the [[Moshiach|Jewish Messiah]].\n\nSome seders (including the original Women's Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam.<ref name=\"miriamscup.com\">[http://www.miriamscup.com/RitualFirst.htm Miriam's Cup: Miriam's Cup rituals for the family Passover seder].

The first two psalms, [[Psalm 113|113]] and [[Psalm 114|114]], were recited before the meal.  The remaining psalms [[Psalm 115|115]]\u2013[[Psalm 118|118]], are recited at this point. [[Psalm 136]] (the Great Hallel) is then recited, followed by ''[[Nishmat]]'', a portion of the morning service for Shabbat and festivals.\n\nThere are a number of opinions concerning the paragraph ''Yehalelukha'' which normally follows Hallel, and ''[[Yishtabakh]]'', which normally follows ''Nishmat''. Most Ashkenazim recite ''Yehalelukha'' immediately following the Hallel proper, i.e. at the end of Psalm 118, except for the concluding words. After Nishmat, they recite ''Yishtabakh'' in its entirety.  Sephardim recite '\"Yehalelukha'' alone after Nishmat.\n\nAfterwards the Fourth Cup of Wine is drunk and a brief Grace for the \"fruit of the vine\" is said.\n\n===''Nirtzah''===\n{{Main|Passover songs}}\nThe Seder concludes with a prayer that the night's service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: \"''[[L'shanah haba'ah]] b'Yerushalayim!'' \u2013 [[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\" Jews in [[Israel]], and especially those in [[Jerusalem]], recite instead \"''L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim hab'nuyah!'' \u2013 Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!\" Jerusalem is the holiest city in the Bible; it has become symbolic of the idea of spiritual perfection.  The tradition of saying \"Next year in Jerusalem\" is similar to the tradition of opening the door for Elijah: it recognizes that \u201cthis year\u201d we live in an imperfect world outside of \u201cJerusalem,\u201d but we patiently await a time, hopefully \u201cnext year,\u201d in which we live in spiritual perfection.<ref>Kolatch, Alfred J.  ''The Family Seder: A Traditional Passover Haggadah For the Modern Home''.  New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1991.  Print.  p. 99.</ref>\n\nAlthough the 15 orders of the Seder have been complete, the Haggadah concludes with additional songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]] will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is ''Chad Gadya'' (\"One Kid Goat\"). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the [[Vilna Gaon]] as an [[allegory]] to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people at the end of days.\n\nFollowing the Seder, those who are still awake may recite the [[Song of Songs]], engage in Torah learning, or continue talking about the events of the Exodus until sleep overtakes them.\n\n==Non-traditional Seders==\n\n===Feminist Seders===\nIn 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in [[E.

It celebrated the liberation struggle of Black America alongside that of ancient Israel from Pharaoh, and was the first Haggadah to go beyond the original Biblical story. It sparked a large number of Haggadahs celebrating various other forms of liberation \u2013 feminism, vegetarianism, the liberation movements in Latin America in the 1970s, ecological healing, etc.. <!--{{See Waskow's book ''Godwrestling -- Round 2.''}}--> Today, many [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregations hold annual interfaith community Seders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe|title=Unitarian Universalists have diverse and inclusive beliefs|date=9 February 2015|website=UUA.org}}</ref> A number of Interfaith Passover Seder [[Haggadah]]s have been written especially for this purpose.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===White House Passover Seder===\n{{main|White House Passover Seder}}\n\n[[File:Barack Obama hosts a Seder dinner 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Obamas host the first [[White House Passover Seder]] in 2009 (White House photo).]]\nIn 2009 President [[Barack Obama]] began conducting an annual Passover seder in the [[Family Dining Room#2015 Obama redecoration|Old Family Dining Room]] of the [[White House]], marking the first time that a sitting US president hosted a Seder in the White House.<ref name=huff>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/white-house-seder-_n_5146629.html|title=How Three Jewish Junior Obama Staffers Brought The First Passover Seder to the White House|first= Paul Brandeis |last=Raushenbush|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=cs>{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2013/0325/Why-Obama-a-Christian-hosts-a-Passover-seder-each-year-at-White-House|title= Why Obama, a Christian, hosts a Passover seder each year at White House|first=David T.|last=Cook|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref> The private dinner for about 20 guests,<ref name=for>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/news/173508/how-is-the-white-house-seder-different-from-all-ot/|title=How is the White House Seder Different from All Others?|first=Devra|last=Ferst|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> both Jewish and non-Jewish \u2013 including the President and his family, members of the President's and First Lady's staffs, and friends and their families<ref name=hill>{{cite web |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237766-israeli-relations-put-focus-on-white-house-seder|title= Iran deal, Israeli tensions put focus on White House Seder|first=Jordan|last=Fabian|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref> \u2013 features the reading of the Haggadah, traditional rituals such as the hiding of the afikoman and the cup of Elijah, and the reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=huff/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jewish holidays]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|title=A Passover Seder Companion and Analytic Introduction to the Haggadah|first=Martin|last=Sicker|year=2004|isbn=978-0595313693}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Passover Seder}}\n* [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-passover-pesach-seder/ My Jewish Learning: The Passover (Pesach) Seder]\n* [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1980/jewish/passover-seder.htm/ Chabad.org: The Passover Seder]\n\n{{Wikibooks|Passover Haggadah/Kadesh}}\n{{Wikibooks|Passover Haggadah}}\n\n{{Jewish and Israeli holidays}}\n\n[[Category:Passover seder| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish festive meals]]\n[[Category:Jewish law and rituals]]\n[[Category:Jewish sacrificial law]]\n[[Category:Hallel]]\n", "name_user": "71.223.85.140", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSlavery and Freedom)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder"}
