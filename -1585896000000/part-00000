However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed. The Dee Dees arrive again at 3:00 to see Dexter righting something and warn him, he then firmly says that they're interrupting his \"...very important calculations.\" as it shows Dexter's papers for the doorway.<ref>{{cite episode |title=DeeDeemensional |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Dexter's Laboratory |series-link= |first=Rob |last=Renzetti |network=TNT |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=english}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIMDb: {{Rating|7.6|10}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dexter's Laboratory Season 1 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115157/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1 |website=IMDb |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> Rating Graph: {{Rating|7.6|10}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Dexter's Laboratory rating (TV show, 1996-2003) |url=https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/dexter-s-laboratory-ratings-5382/ |website=Rating Graph |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title          = DeeDeemensional\n| series         = [[Dexter's Laboratory]]\n| image          = The intertitle for DeeDeemensional.jpg\n| image_size     = 220\n| alt            = Dexter looks up with his 3d glasses as his sister appears twice, on in blue and one in red, as the title of the episode shows below.\n| caption        = The [[intertitle]].\n| season         = 1\n| series_no      =\n| episode        = 1a\n| director       = \n* [[Rob Renzetti]] (director)\n* [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] (director)\n* [[Horseman Cao]] (animation director)\n* [[Chris Cuddington]] (animation director)\n* [[Bodie Chandler]] (music director)\n| writer         = Rob Renzetti\n| story          = \n| teleplay       = \n| based_on       = \n| narrator       = \n| presenter      =\n| producer       = \n* Genndy Tartakovsky (producer)\n* [[Lary Huber]] (executive producer)\n* [[Buzz Potamkin]] (executive producer)\n* [[Fred Seibert]] (executive producer)\n* [[Ted Turner]] (executive producer)\n* [[Davis Doi]] (supervising producer)\n* [[Debby Hindman]] (associative producer)\n* [[Bob Onorato]] (line producer)\n| music          = \n* Bodie Chandler (director)\n* [[Gary Lionelli]] (composer)\n* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (composer)\n* [[Pamela Phillips Oland]] (end lyrics)\n| photographer   = \n| editor         = \n* [[Pat Foley]] (supervising film editor)\n* [[Paul Douglas (editor)|Paul Douglas]] (supervising film editor) (supervising editor)\n* [[Tom Gleason]] (supervising editor)\n* [[Gina Lamar]] (post-production assistant)\n* [[John Forrest Niss]] (post-production executive)\n* [[William Deboer Jr.]] (negative cutter)\n| production     = 102a<ref>{{cite web |title=DeeDeemensional |url=https://dexterslab.fandom.com/wiki/DeeDeemensional |website=Dexter's Laboratory Wiki |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| airdate        = {{Start date|1996|04|27}}\n| length         = 7 minutes\n| awards         = \n| guests         = \n| prev           = \n| next           = [[Dial M for Monkey: Magmanamus]]\n| season_article = \n| episode_list   = [[List of Dexter's Laboratory episodes]]\n}}\n\"'''DeeDeemensional'''\" is the first of thre shorts of the first episode of the [[Cartoon Network|animated television series]] \"[[Dexter's Laboratory]]\".

This important property allows the replicator equation to capture the essence of [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Unlike the quasispecies equation, the replicator equation does not incorporate [[mutation]] and so is not able to innovate new types or pure strategies. \n\n== Equation ==\n\nThe most general continuous form of the replicator equation is given by the [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\dot{x_i} = x_i [ f_i(x) - \\varphi(x)], \\quad \\varphi(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j f_j(x)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>x_i</math> is the proportion of type <math> i </math> in the population, <math>x=(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)</math> is the vector of the distribution of types in the population, <math>f_i(x)</math> is the fitness of type <math>i</math> (which is dependent on the population), and <math>\\varphi(x)</math> is the average population fitness (given by the weighted average of the fitness of the <math>n</math> types in the population). Since the elements of the population vector <math>x</math> sum to unity by definition, the equation is defined on the n-dimensional [[simplex]].\n\nThe replicator equation assumes a uniform population distribution; that is, it does not incorporate population structure into the fitness. The fitness landscape does incorporate the population distribution of types, in contrast to other similar equations, such as the quasispecies equation.\n\nIn application, populations are generally finite, making the discrete version more realistic. The analysis is more difficult and computationally intensive in the discrete formulation, so the continuous form is often used, although there are significant properties that are lost due to this smoothing. Note that the continuous form can be obtained from the discrete form by a [[limiting]] process.\n\nTo simplify analysis, fitness is often assumed to depend linearly upon the population distribution, which allows the replicator equation to be written in the form:\n\n:<math>\\dot{x_i}=x_i\\left(\\left(Ax\\right)_i-x^TAx\\right)</math>\n\nwhere the [[payoff matrix]] <math>A</math> holds all the fitness information for the population: the expected payoff can be written as <math>\\left(Ax\\right)_i</math> and the mean fitness of the population as a whole can be written as <math>x^TAx</math>. It can be shown that the change in the ratio of two proportions <math>x_{i}/x_{j}</math> with respect to time is:<math display=\"block\">{d\\over{dt}}\\left( {x_{i}\\over{x_{j}}} \\right) = {x_{i}\\over{x_{j}}} \\left[ f_{i}(x) - f_{j}(x) \\right]</math>In other words, the change in the ratio is driven entirely by the difference in fitness between types.<br />\n\n=== Derivation of deterministic and stochastic replicator dynamics ===\nSuppose that the number of individuals of type <math>i</math> is <math>N_{i}</math> and that the total number of individuals is <math>N</math>. Define the proportion of each type to be <math>x_{i} = N_{i}/N</math>. Assume that the change in each type is governed by [[geometric Brownian motion]]:<math display=\"block\">dN_{i} = f_{i}N_{i}dt + \\sigma_{i}N_{i}dW_{i}</math>where <math>f_{i}</math> is the fitness associated with type <math>i</math>. The average fitness of the types <math>\\varphi = x^{T}f</math>. The [[Wiener process|Wiener processes]] are assumed to be uncorrelated. For <math>x_{i}(N_{1},...,N_{m})</math>, [[It\u00f4's lemma]] then gives us:<math display=\"block\">\\begin{aligned}\ndx_{i}(N_{1},...,N_{m}) &= {\\partial x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}}}dN_{j} + {1\\over{2}}{\\partial^{2}x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}\\partial N_{k}}}dN_{j}dN_{k} \\\\\n&= {\\partial x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}}}dN_{j} + {1\\over{2}}{\\partial^{2}x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}^{2}}}(dN_{j})^{2}\n\\end{aligned}</math>The partial derivatives are then:<math display=\"block\">\\begin{aligned}\n{\\partial x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}}} &= {1\\over{N}}\\delta_{ij} - {x_{i}\\over{N}} \\\\\n{\\partial^{2} x_{i}\\over{\\partial N_{j}^{2}}} &= -{2\\over{N^{2}}}\\delta_{ij} + {2x_{i}\\over{N^{2}}}\n\\end{aligned}</math>where <math>\\delta_{ij}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta|Kronecker delta function]]. These relationships imply that:<math display=\"block\">dx_{i} = {dN_{i}\\over{N}} -x_{i}\\sum_{j}{dN_{j}\\over{N}} - {(dN_{i})^{2}\\over{N^{2}}} + x_{i}\\sum_{j}{(dN_{j})^{2}\\over{N^{2}}}</math>Each of the components in this equation may be calculated as:<math display=\"block\">\\begin{aligned}\n{dN_{i}\\over{N}} &= f_{i}x_{i}dt + \\sigma_{i}x_{i}dW_{i} \\\\\n-x_{i}\\sum_{j}{dN_{j}\\over{N}} &= -x_{i}\\left(\\varphi dt + \\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j}x_{j}dW_{j} \\right) \\\\\n-{(dN_{i})^{2}\\over{N^{2}}} &= -\\sigma_{i}^{2}x_{i}^{2}dt \\\\\nx_{i}\\sum_{j}{(dN_{j})^{2}\\over{N^{2}}} &= x_{i}\\left( \\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j}^{2}x_{j}^{2}\\right )dt\n\\end{aligned}</math>Then the stochastic replicator dynamics equation for each type is given by:<math display=\"block\">dx_{i} = x_{i}\\left(f_{i} -\\varphi-\\sigma_{i}^{2}x_{i} + \\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j}^{2}x_{j}^{2} \\right)dt + x_{i}\\left(\\sigma_{i}dW_{i}-\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j}x_{j}dW_{j} \\right )</math>Assuming that the <math>\\sigma_{i}</math> terms are identically zero, the deterministic replicator dynamics equation is recovered.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n{{Main|Evolutionarily stable state}}\n\nThe analysis differs in the continuous and discrete cases: in the former, methods from differential equations are utilized, whereas in the latter the methods tend to be stochastic. Since the replicator equation is non-linear, an exact solution is difficult to obtain (even in simple versions of the continuous form) so the equation is usually analyzed in terms of stability. The replicator equation (in its continuous and discrete forms) satisfies the [[Folk theorem (game theory) | folk theorem]] of evolutionary game theory which characterizes the stability of equilibria of the equation. The solution of the equation is often given by the set of [[evolutionarily stable state]]s of the population.\n\nIn general nondegenerate cases, there can be at most one interior evolutionary stable state (ESS), though there can be many equilibria on the boundary of the simplex. All the faces of the simplex are forward-invariant which corresponds to the lack of innovation in the replicator equation: once a strategy becomes extinct there is no way to revive it.\n\nPhase portrait solutions for the continuous linear-fitness replicator equation have been classified in the two and three dimensional cases. Classification is more difficult in higher dimensions because the number of distinct portraits increases rapidly.\n\n== Relationships to other equations ==\n\nThe continuous replicator equation on <math>n</math> types is equivalent to the [[Generalized Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation]] in <math>n-1</math> dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bomze|first=Immanuel M.|date=1983-10-01|title=Lotka-Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: A two-dimensional classification|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00318088|journal=Biological Cybernetics|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=201\u2013211|doi=10.1007/BF00318088|issn=1432-0770}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bomze|first=Immanuel M.|date=1995-04-01|title=Lotka-Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00201420|journal=Biological Cybernetics|language=en|volume=72|issue=5|pages=447\u2013453|doi=10.1007/BF00201420|issn=1432-0770}}</ref> The transformation is made by the change of variables: \n:<math>x_i = \\frac{y_i}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}} \\quad i=1, \\ldots,n-1 </math>\n:<math>x_n = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}},</math>\nwhere <math>y_i</math> is the Lotka&ndash;Volterra variable.

This equation is a simultaneous generalization of the replicator equation and the [[quasispecies]] equation, and is used in the mathematical analysis of language.\n\nThe replicator equation can easily be generalized to [[asymmetric games]].

Since the replicator equation is non-linear, an exact solution is difficult to obtain (even in simple versions of the continuous form) so the equation is usually analyzed in terms of stability. The replicator equation (in its continuous and discrete forms) satisfies the [[Folk theorem (game theory) | folk theorem]] of evolutionary game theory which characterizes the stability of equilibria of the equation. The solution of the equation is often given by the set of [[evolutionarily stable state]]s of the population.\n\nIn general nondegenerate cases, there can be at most one interior evolutionary stable state (ESS), though there can be many equilibria on the boundary of the simplex. All the faces of the simplex are forward-invariant which corresponds to the lack of innovation in the replicator equation: once a strategy becomes extinct there is no way to revive it.\n\nPhase portrait solutions for the continuous linear-fitness replicator equation have been classified in the two and three dimensional cases. Classification is more difficult in higher dimensions because the number of distinct portraits increases rapidly.\n\n== Relationships to other equations ==\n\nThe continuous replicator equation on <math>n</math> types is equivalent to the [[Generalized Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation]] in <math>n-1</math> dimensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bomze|first=Immanuel M.|date=1983-10-01|title=Lotka-Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: A two-dimensional classification|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00318088|journal=Biological Cybernetics|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=201\u2013211|doi=10.1007/BF00318088|issn=1432-0770}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bomze|first=Immanuel M.|date=1995-04-01|title=Lotka-Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00201420|journal=Biological Cybernetics|language=en|volume=72|issue=5|pages=447\u2013453|doi=10.1007/BF00201420|issn=1432-0770}}</ref> The transformation is made by the change of variables: \n:<math>x_i = \\frac{y_i}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}} \\quad i=1, \\ldots,n-1 </math>\n:<math>x_n = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}},</math>\nwhere <math>y_i</math> is the Lotka&ndash;Volterra variable.

This equation is a simultaneous generalization of the replicator equation and the [[quasispecies]] equation, and is used in the mathematical analysis of language.\n\nThe replicator equation can easily be generalized to [[asymmetric games]]. A recent generalization that incorporates population structure is used in [[evolutionary graph theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Erez|last2=Hauert|first2=Christoph|last3=Nowak|first3=Martin A.|date=2005|title=Evolutionary dynamics on graphs|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03204|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=433|issue=7023|pages=312\u2013316|doi=10.1038/nature03204|issn=1476-4687|via=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Cressman, R.

Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\".

In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations.

Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86\u201387}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

For example, [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], who was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor \"operations\" against the Armenians, later became [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign minister and \"Protector of Bohemia and Moravia\" during [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s terror in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Fisk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html |title=Photograph links Germans to 1915 Armenia genocide |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Armin T.

In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of reasons: \"obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly by the mobilisation, but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race [utrotandet af den armeniska rasen]\".<ref name=\"Avedian\" />{{rp |52}}\n\nWirs\u00e9n, when writing his memoirs from his mission to the Balkans and Turkey, ''Minnen fr\u00e5n fred och krig'' (\"Memories from Peace and War\"), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian Genocide, entitled ''Mordet p\u00e5 en nation'' (\"The Murder of a Nation\"). Commenting on the interpretation that the deportations resulted from the purported collaboration of the Armenians with the Russians, Wirsen states that the deportations were nothing but a cover for their extermination: \"Officially, these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate [utrota] the Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a dominating position\".<ref name=\"Avedian\" />{{rp |28}} He concluded: \"The annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human feelings&nbsp;...

Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\".

In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations.

Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name=\"Ak\u00e7am\" />{{rp |86\u201387}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

For example, [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], who was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor \"operations\" against the Armenians, later became [[Adolf Hitler]]'s foreign minister and \"Protector of Bohemia and Moravia\" during [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s terror in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Fisk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html |title=Photograph links Germans to 1915 Armenia genocide |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==== Armin T.

In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of reasons: \"obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly by the mobilisation, but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race [utrotandet af den armeniska rasen]\".<ref name=\"Avedian\" />{{rp |52}}\n\nWirs\u00e9n, when writing his memoirs from his mission to the Balkans and Turkey, ''Minnen fr\u00e5n fred och krig'' (\"Memories from Peace and War\"), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian Genocide, entitled ''Mordet p\u00e5 en nation'' (\"The Murder of a Nation\"). Commenting on the interpretation that the deportations resulted from the purported collaboration of the Armenians with the Russians, Wirsen states that the deportations were nothing but a cover for their extermination: \"Officially, these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate [utrota] the Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a dominating position\".<ref name=\"Avedian\" />{{rp |28}} He concluded: \"The annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human feelings&nbsp;...
