The description below focuses on a specific mechanism of valvular pathology but there are other causes of valve pathology and fibrosis of the cardiac muscle.\n\nFibrocyte cells normally secrete [[collagen]], and function to provide structural support for the heart. When over-activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve, with white tissue building up primarily on the [[tricuspid valve]], but also occurring on the [[pulmonary valve]]. The thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right-sided [[heart failure]].\n\n== Connection with excess blood serotonin (5-HT) ==\n\nCertain diseases such as gastrointestinal [[carcinoid]] tumors of the mid-gut, which sometimes release large amounts of 5-hydroxytryptamine, commonly known as 5-HT or [[serotonin]] into the blood, may produce a characteristic pattern of mostly right-sided cardiac fibrosis which can be identified at autopsy. This pathology has also been seen in certain East-African tribes who eat foods ([[Matoke]] \u2014a green banana) containing excess amounts of serotonin.\n\n== Connection with direct serotonergic agonist drugs ==\nElevated prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and related valvopathies was found to be associated with use of a number of unrelated drugs following long-term statistical analysis once the drugs had been on the market for some time. The cause of this was unknown at the time, but eventually it was realised that all the implicated drugs acted as agonists at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in the heart in addition to their intended sites of action elsewhere in the body.<ref name=\"pmid17202454\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanettini R, Antonini A, Gatto G, Gentile R, Tesei S, Pezzoli G |title=Valvular heart disease and the use of

The description below focuses on a specific mechanism of valvular pathology but there are other causes of valve pathology and fibrosis of the cardiac muscle.\n\nFibrocyte cells normally secrete [[collagen]], and function to provide structural support for the heart. When over-activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve, with white tissue building up primarily on the [[tricuspid valve]], but also occurring on the [[pulmonary valve]]. The thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right-sided [[heart failure]].\n\n== Connection with excess blood serotonin (5-HT) ==\n\nCertain diseases such as gastrointestinal [[carcinoid]] tumors of the mid-gut, which sometimes release large amounts of 5-hydroxytryptamine, commonly known as 5-HT or [[serotonin]] into the blood, may produce a characteristic pattern of mostly right-sided cardiac fibrosis which can be identified at autopsy. This pathology has also been seen in certain East-African tribes who eat foods ([[Matoke]] \u2014a green banana) containing excess amounts of serotonin.\n\n== Connection with direct serotonergic agonist drugs ==\nElevated prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and related valvopathies was found to be associated with use of a number of unrelated drugs following long-term statistical analysis once the drugs had been on the market for some time. The cause of this was unknown at the time, but eventually it was realised that all the implicated drugs acted as agonists at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in the heart in addition to their intended

It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1694 and later became the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. It inherited the unique distinction in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its headdress as well as the front, a tradition that originated with the 28th Regiment after it fought in two ranks back to back at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two [[Regular army|regular]], two [[Militia (Great Britain)|militia]] and two [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer]] battalions, and saw its first action during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], the regiment's four auxiliary battalions were converted to three [[Territorial Force]] battalions and a [[Special Reserve]] battalion, and a further 18 battalions were added to the regiment's establishment during the war. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing a total of 8,100 men killed and winning 72 different [[battle honour]]s. Four awards of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. The wartime battalions were disbanded as the war ended, and just before the [[Second World War]], two of the territorial battalions were re-purposed and ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the remaining territorial battalion was duplicated, and another five battalions were raised on the outbreak of war, though most of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war progressed. Four battalions saw active service under the regiment's colours during the war. The 2nd and 5th Battalions both fought in the [[Battle of France]] and, after being lost almost in its entirety during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], the re-formed 2nd Battalion landed at [[Gold Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] and fought in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaign in North-West Europe. The 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], and the 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of Japanese forces during the [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, the hostilities-only battalions were disbanded and the 1st and 2nd Battalions were [[wikt:amalgamated|amalgamated]], leaving the regiment with one regular and one [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] battalion. It achieved fame during the [[Korean War]] when the 1st Battalion held out for three nights against overwhelming odds during the [[Battle of the Imjin River]]. The stand, described by the commander of the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea at the time as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\", prevented the encirclement of other United Nations forces, for which the regiment was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and earned the nickname ''The Glorious Glosters''. Two men serving with the regiment were awarded the VC for their actions in the battle. In the latter half of the 20th century, the regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion and completed tours of duty around the world, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, as well as in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]]. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which carried more battle honours on its [[Military colours, standards and guidons|colours]] than any other regiment of the line, was merged with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment inherited the back badge, and when it too was merged in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor, [[The Rifles]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Soldier of 28th regiment 1742.jpg|thumb|upright|Uniform of the 28th c.1742 with its yellow [[Facing colour|facings]]]]\n\nThe Gloucestershire Regiment traced its roots to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, raised in 1694 in Portsmouth,<ref>Daniell p. 3</ref> which first saw action in 1705 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 12</ref> Having been commanded by, and therefore named after, a succession of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and fought under this name during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 18</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|title=Bragg\u2019s Regiment and the 28th Foot&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230907/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another predecessor, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was formed in 1758 when the British Army was expanded during the [[Seven Years' War]].

On 21&nbsp;March, during the [[Battle of Alexandria]], French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. With the men still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given for the rear rank to turn about, and standing thus in two ranks back to back, the regiment held the line. To commemorate this action, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress, a unique distinction in the British Army that was officially sanctioned in 1830.<ref>Daniell pp. 69\u201375</ref><ref name=Grazebrook>Grazebrook pp. 112\u2013113</ref>{{efn|The origins of the back badge and its initial form are not known; other than the honour \"Egypt\", awarded to all units, there is no record of a special badge being officially granted. An officer who served with the regiment between 1805 and 1807 wrote that the regiment \"acquired the emblem of the double front.\" In 1815, a staff officer witnessed the regiment marching out to Quatre Bras \"having their number both in front and rear of their low caps\u2014a memorial of Egypt.\" The first record of official recognition appears in an 1830 letter from the [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], which states that \"it was never the intention to deprive the 28th Regiment of any badge of honour they may have acquired by their distinguished service in Egypt, and that there will be no objection to their retaining the plate they have been accustomed to wear on the back of their caps since that service...\" This was officially confirmed in another letter dated 1843.

The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and added \"Alma\", \"Inkerman\" and \"Sevastopol\" to its legacy.<ref>Daniell ch.XIII\u2013XIV</ref>\n\nAnother thread that would be woven into the story of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the civilian administered auxiliary forces which supported the army in times of need. In the mid-18th century, county [[Militia (Great Britain)|militias]] were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and these were organised in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at [[Cecily Hill Barracks|Cirencester]].<ref>Daniell p. 26</ref> In 1859, county-based [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer rifle corps]] were raised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.<ref>Daniell pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Colours in Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|The regimental colours in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]\nIn 1872, the [[Cardwell Reforms]] began the process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line infantry regiments, a process that was completed by the [[Childers Reforms]] nine years later. As a result, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at [[Horfield Barracks]] in Bristol.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24992|pages=3300\u20133301|date=1 July 1881}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 186\u2013187.

It was a privilege that the 2nd Battalion did not want, but it was made palatable to the former 61st Regiment by replacing the number 28 with the Sphinx, a battle honour awarded to both predecessor regiments.<ref name=\"formation\"/> Although both battalions were forced to give up their individual [[facing colour]]s on their uniforms&nbsp;\u2013 yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st Regiment&nbsp;\u2013 when the government imposed a standard white across all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never accepted this change for their [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]]. Both battalions retained their former colours until 1929, when a compromise primrose yellow was finally chosen and a new regimental colour subsequently presented.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 188</ref>\n\nThe two battalions continued to refer to themselves by their former regimental numbers until they were merged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment became a single-battalion regiment. The 1st Battalion celebrated the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the anniversary of the Battle of Alexandria annually. The 2nd Battalion, on the other hand, held games followed by a dinner and a ball on the anniversary of the 61st Regiment's victory at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwallah]] on 13 January 1849 when overseas, or on the anniversary of that regiment's victory at [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]] on 22 July 1812 when at home.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 189</ref>\n\nThe new regiment acquired its march, ''The Kinnegad Slashers'', and its official nickname, ''Slashers'', from the 28th Regiment. The name arose from an incident in 1764, when members of the regiment allegedly slashed off part of the ear of a Montreal magistrate who had been harassing soldiers stationed in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was also sometimes referred to as ''The Old Braggs'', from Colonel [[Philip Bragg]], who commanded the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two other nicknames associated with the new regiment were inherited from the 61st Regiment; ''The Flowers of Toulouse'', from the scarlet uniforms of that regiment's many dead in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]], and ''The Silver-Tailed Dandies'', from the silver decorations on the longer-than-normal coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform.<ref>Daniell pp. 17, 41\u201342, 118, 178</ref>\n\n==Second Boer War==\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.

When the column came under fire near Rietfontein, the battalion was detached and ordered forward, but the order was ambiguous and the battalion advanced too far.

The troops moved out on the night of 29&nbsp;October with the intention to be in position before the main battle started, but they left too late to reach their objective before daybreak. As they took up an alternative position on the nearby Tchrengula Hill the pack-mules bolted, taking most of the heavy weaponry and ammunition with them. The Boers discovered the incursion at dawn and surrounded the position, and although the British held out for several hours they were forced to surrender at 12:30. The battalion lost 38 killed and 115 wounded, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Pretoria.<ref>Daniell pp. 191\u2013194</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|title=The Siege of Ladysmith&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013173326/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhile the remainder of the 1st Battalion helped in the defence of Ladysmith (the city was eventually [[relief of Ladysmith|relieved]] on 1&nbsp;March), the 2nd Battalion deployed to South Africa, arriving in January 1900. The battalion fought in the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], a nine-day battle which ended on 27&nbsp;February with the capture of the Boer general [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] and his force of some 4,000 men. On 15&nbsp;March, the battalion entered the Boer city of Bloemfontein, where it remained on garrison duties until 1904. The 1st Battalion, re-united when its POWs were liberated after the capture of Pretoria on 5&nbsp;July, was posted in August 1900 to Ceylon, where it remained until 1903 guarding Boer prisoners of war.<ref>Daniell pp. 194\u2013199, 203</ref>\n\nSome of the regiment's auxiliary battalions, which in 1900 were increased in number by the formation of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion,<ref name=\"Daniell p. 199\">Daniell p. 199</ref> also played a role in the war.

The battalion fought its first action on 8&nbsp;August in the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], during which it suffered over 820 casualties, including all of its officers, [[warrant officer]]s and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s. It was brought back up to strength and moved to Egypt in January 1916. In March, the 13th Division was transferred to Mesopotamia, but on landing at Basra the battalion was put out of action by an outbreak of [[Relapsing fever borreliosis|relapsing fever]]. It rejoined the division in the middle of April and fought in the unsuccessful attempt to lift the [[siege of Kut]]. The battalion saw action in December 1916 and February 1917 during the subsequent advance on and [[Second Battle of Kut|capture of Kut]], and fought its last battle on 29&nbsp;March 1917 during the [[Samarrah Offensive|Samarrah offensive]]. It spent the next 15 months mostly on defensive and garrison duties and was disbanded in September 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\n====8th Battalion====\n[[File:Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart by Sir William Orpen.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who won the Victoria Cross while commanding officer of the 8th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment]]\nThe 8th Battalion was raised in Bristol in September 1914. It arrived in France in July 1915 as part of the [[57th Brigade (United Kingdom)|57th Brigade]] in the [[19th (Western) Division]]<ref name=James /> and saw its first action the next year during the [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Battle of Albert]], in which it helped [[Capture of La Boisselle|capture La Boisselle]]. The division's 58th Brigade had captured the western half of the village on 2&nbsp;July, and the 8th Battalion [[North Staffordshire Regiment]] and 10th Battalion [[Worcestershire Regiment]], both of the 57th Brigade, assisted in the capture of the rest of the village the next day. A German counter-attack regained the eastern half of the village, and the 8th Glosters suffered 302 casualties when it fought alongside the 10th Battalion [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] to help retake it. During the battle, the Glosters' commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], assumed command of all four 57th Brigade battalions when the other three commanding officers became casualties, and for his actions in averting a serious reverse he was awarded the VC. Later the same month, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion made two unsuccessful attacks against the German line east of the village which together cost it 374 casualties, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major [[Lord Alexander Thynne|Lord A.G. Thynne]], both wounded. On 18&nbsp;November, the last day of the Somme offensive, the battalion suffered 295 casualties when it captured Grandcourt during the [[Battle of the Ancre]].<ref>Littlewood pp. 117\u2013118. Lt-Col de Wiart credited his award of the VC to 8th Battalion, \"for every man in the Battalion has done as much as I have\"</ref><ref>Daniell p. 223</ref>\n\nIn 1917, the 8th Battalion saw action in June during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], fought two minor actions in July near Oosttaverne, south of Ypres, and was involved in the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] in August. The battalion was next in action on the evening of 21&nbsp;March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive, when the Germans captured Doignies. Unable to recapture the village, the battalion blocked any further enemy progress until the morning of 23&nbsp;March, when German forces broke through on the left and threatened to outflank it. Company A fought to the last man covering the battalion's withdrawal, for which action the company commander, Captain [[Manley Angell James]], was awarded the VC. By the time the 19th Division withdrew to Doullens on 28&nbsp;March the battalion had suffered 323 casualties.<ref>Littlewood pp. 119\u2013121, 185</ref> In April, the battalion fought in three engagements of the Battle of the Lys: the Battles of Messines, Bailleul and First Kemmel. The following month, the 19th Division's parent unit, [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], was transferred to the French Sixth Army. The division was supposed to rest and re-organise in a quiet sector, but on 27&nbsp;May the Germans launched a major attack, ensnaring the 8th Battalion in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne]]. The battalion saw its last action in October, during the Battle of the Selle, and was disbanded in May 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 121\u2013122</ref>\n\n====9th Battalion====\nThe 9th Battalion was formed in Bristol in September 1914 and reached France in September 1915 as part of the [[78th Brigade (United Kingdom)|78th Brigade]] in the [[26th Division (United Kingdom)|26th Division]].<ref name=James /> The division was transferred to XII Corps of the British Salonika Army in November 1915, and the battalion held the line around Tumba, north of Salonika, until July 1916, when the division relieved the French south of Lake Dojran. The battalion participated in two attacks against the Bulgarian lines, on 25&nbsp;April and 8&nbsp;May 1917, during the [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Battle of Dojran]]. In July 1918, the battalion was transferred to the [[198th (East Lancashire) Brigade|198th Brigade]] of the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Division]] in France, becoming the divisional pioneers, and was disbanded in November 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n====10th Battalion====\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=My word, as soon as the order was given the Gloucesters were out and over the parapet and soon doing great havoc among the Germans.\n|author=Unnamed lance-corporal, 10th Battalion<br />Battle of Loos<ref>Daniell p. 209</ref>}}\nThe 10th Battalion was raised in September 1914 in Bristol, but was recruited mainly by volunteers from Cheltenham.<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 139</ref> It crossed to France in August 1915 and replaced one of the Guards battalions in the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Brigade]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]].

On 23&nbsp;July 1916, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion attacked the German line east of the village, and was involved in two further attacks in the same area in August, all without success. The battalion's last action of the war came on 9&nbsp;September, in a failed attack on High Wood which cost it 122 casualties. In 1917, the 1st Division was allocated to Operation Hush, and when that was cancelled the 10th battalion moved to the Ypres area. It was disbanded in February 1918 and its men distributed among the regiment's 1st and 8th Battalions and the 13th Entrenching Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 139\u2013141</ref><ref>Westlake p. 137</ref>\n\n====12th Battalion (Bristol's Own)====\n{{main|12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol's Own)}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Somme, July-november 1916 Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Battalion troops move up during the Battle of Morval]]\nThe 12th Battalion was raised in Bristol in August 1914 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee.

The division returned to France in April 1918, occupying positions in the line near Nieppe Forest, and the battalion saw action on 25&nbsp;April and 28&nbsp;June, both times successfully advancing the front line. Its last action came during the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]], where it suffered some 100 casualties on 21&nbsp;August but succeeded in capturing [[Irles]] on 23&nbsp;August. On 6&nbsp;October, the battalion was disbanded and its men distributed among the other units of the 5th Division.<ref>Littlewood pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n====13th Battalion (Forest of Dean)====\nThe 13th Battalion was raised in December 1914 at Malvern by [[Sir Henry Webb, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Webb]] and recruited from the miners of the Forest of Dean, South Wales and the Durham coalfields. In July 1915, it was taken over by the War Office and went to France in March 1916 as divisional pioneers to the [[39th Division (United Kingdom)|39th Division]].<ref name=James /> The battalion saw its first significant action on 30&nbsp;June 1916, during the [[Battle of the Boar's Head]], when it dug communication trenches behind the assaulting troops. On several occasions during the battle the pioneers had to stop digging to defend themselves, and the battalion suffered 71 casualties. It saw action again towards the end of 1916 during operations on the Ancre, including the [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]] and the Battle of the Ancre. In March 1918, the battalion suffered particularly badly in the opening week of the [[German Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], during which it was required to take positions in the line as infantry, and by the time the division was withdrawn on 31&nbsp;March the battalion had sustained 326 casualties. In April, the survivors were allocated to composite infantry battalions and saw their last action on 26&nbsp;April during the Second Battle of Kemmel, part of the Battle of the Lys, after which the battalion was reduced to a training cadre.<ref>Littlewood pp. 159\u2013162</ref>\n\n====14th Battalion (West of England)====\nThe 14th Battalion was a [[Bantam (military)|bantam]] unit of volunteers from Bristol and Birmingham who had previously been rejected for service because of their short height. It was raised in April 1915 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee, adopted by the War Office in June 1915, and departed for France in January 1916 as part of the [[105th Brigade (United Kingdom)|105th Brigade]] in the [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]].<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 167</ref> The battalion went into the line in March, where the men's first task was to raise the height of the [[wikt:fire step|firing step]],<ref>Daniell pp. 225\u2013226</ref> and its first significant action came on 8&nbsp;June, when it conducted a large raid south-east of Neuve Chapelle. In July, following the [[capture of Tr\u00f4nes Wood]] by the 18th Division during the Battle of Bazentin, the battalion moved into the line at the northern end of the wood where, on 19&nbsp;July, it suffered 107 casualties to enemy artillery.<ref>Westlake p. 138</ref> On 21&nbsp;August 1917, while in the line near \u00c9pehy, the Germans attacked one of the battalion's bombing posts. Although his bombing party were driven back, Second-Lieutenant [[Hardy Falconer Parsons]] remained and prevented the enemy from entering the trenches, for which act he was posthumously awarded the VC. The battalion fought in the Action of 22&nbsp;October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw its last action on 4&nbsp;February 1918, when it successfully attacked a fortified farm in the Ypres sector. Seven days later the battalion was disbanded and its men transferred to the 13th Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 167\u2013170</ref>\n\n====18th Battalion====\nThe 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], and decamped to France in August 1918 as part of the [[49th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division|16th Division]]. It went into action on 11&nbsp;September, when it successfully assaulted the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its last action on 18&nbsp;September, when a German attack drove A Company from its forward posts. The battalion was disbanded in June 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Fifth Gloucester Gazette===\n[[File:Lieutenant FW Harvey DCM.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant F. W.

The 1st Battalion completed tours of duty in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican [[Se\u00e1n Moylan]], and Germany, which counted as a home posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In 1928, the 2nd Battalion returned to the UK and the 1st Battalion was posted overseas, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938.<ref>Daniell pp. 232\u2013235</ref> Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937.<ref>Daniell p. 237</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|title=Egypt and Preparation for War|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163707/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|archive-date=2017-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, the 5th Battalion became the regiment's sole territorial unit when the 4th Battalion was converted to the [[66th (Gloucesters) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (RA), and the 6th Battalion converted to the [[44th Royal Tank Regiment|44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Daniell p. 239</ref> On the eve of the [[Second World War]], the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and the 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line duplicate of the 5th Battalion.<ref>Daniell p. 425</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:\n* 1st Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 stationed around Rangoon in Burma<ref>Daniell p. 265</ref>\n* 2nd Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]] in the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]<ref>Joslen p. 246</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#5th_Gloucesters|5th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 144th Infantry Brigade in the 48th Division<ref>Joslen p. 329</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#7th_Gloucesters|7th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 183rd Infantry Brigade in the 61st Division<ref>Joslen p. 376</ref>\n\n===Battle of France===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=Completely surrounded, with our lack of weapons there was only one thing to do.

The 5th Battalion marched {{convert|95|mi|km|-1}} in 83 hours with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in a matter of minutes to an airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20&nbsp;May, when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) for two days before the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] resumed its retreat. On 25&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of Somer Force. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the [[Battle of Dunkirk|outer perimeter around Dunkirk]]. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27&nbsp;May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29&nbsp;May, but few made it to Dunkirk. The 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties at Cassel, 484 of them POWs.<ref>Daniell pp. 251\u2013259</ref> Meanwhile, the 5th Battalion was given a similar task at the villages of Arneke and Ledringhem, some {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26&nbsp;May, and the first attacks came the next day. By 28&nbsp;May, the battalion had concentrated at Ledringhem, where it was surrounded, and it withdrew under orders in the early hours of 29&nbsp;May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day and were subsequently taken off the beach by [[Little Ships of Dunkirk|little ships]]. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.<ref>Daniell pp. 260\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Retreat from Rangoon===\n[[File:Japanese Conquest of Burma April-May 1942.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Japanese Conquest of Burma April\u2013May 1942]]\nIn March 1942, the 1st Battalion provided the rearguard for the British retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. It saw its first significant action of the war on 7 and 8&nbsp;March at the [[Taukkyan Roadblock]], and for the rest of the month operated independently to cover the retreat, fighting battles at Letpadan on 17&nbsp;March and Paungde on 27&nbsp;March. In a subsequent battle near Padigong, {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from Paungde, D Company became isolated for 17 hours and had to fight its way back to the battalion at Shwedaung. In the meantime, the battalion became part of the [[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]] in the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Infantry Division]], which had to fight its way to and through Shwedaung when Japanese forces infiltrated between the rearguard and the main column. By the end of March, the 1st Battalion had been reduced to 140 all ranks, its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 270\u2013280</ref>\n\nIn mid-April, the under-strength battalion became so dispersed while protecting demolition parties at oil installations around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot returned from hospital he was informed the battalion had ceased to exist. He was nevertheless able to gather the remnants, now numbering 7 officers and 170 other ranks, at Shwebo on 27&nbsp;April, and the battalion was subsequently reinforced by a draft of 3 officers and 120 other ranks. When the Japanese threatened Monywa, Bagot took command of all the troops in the area, which included the 1st Battalion, to form Bagot Force. This mixed group of units fought a delaying action at Budalin, {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} north of Monywa, on 4&nbsp;May before withdrawing to Ye-u. The battalion continued to act as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9&nbsp;May and into India at Tamu at the end of the month.<ref>Daniell pp. 280\u2013286</ref> At the same time, the Japanese halted operations in Burma. Since the start of the retreat from Rangoon on 7&nbsp;March the battalion had lost 8 officers and 156 other ranks killed in action or died of sickness, and many more wounded.<ref>Daniell p. 285</ref> The battalion was rested and brought back up to strength in India, where it spent the remainder of the war, and saw no further action.<ref>Daniell pp. 308\u2013309</ref>\n\n===Home front===\nOn its return to the UK, the 5th Battalion was brought back up to strength and manned coastal defences in Cornwall. It converted to a reconnaissance role in June 1941, eventually becoming the [[43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment]], and from October it ceased to have any affiliation with the Gloucestershire Regiment.<ref>Daniell pp. 288\u2013289</ref><ref>Joslen p. 69</ref> Its duplicate, the 7th Battalion, was posted to Northern Ireland, but saw no action and became a training unit in 1944.<ref>Daniell p. 289</ref> With so many of its men languishing in POW camps, the 2nd Battalion was rebuilt and served in home defence at various locations around the UK, finally ending up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being assigned to a more active role.<ref>Daniell pp. 288, 292</ref>\n\nAs the UK braced itself for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German plan to invade, a number of [[Home Service Battalions|home defence]] battalions were raised under the regiment's colours. The 8th Battalion was formed from the [[National Defence Companies]] and consisted of men too old, too young or unfit for active service, and the younger contingent from this battalion later formed the 70th Battalion. The 9th and 10th Battalions were also raised, the former serving in Northern Ireland, the latter in south Wales and then Lincolnshire. The 11th Battalion was created in October 1940 from a re-designation of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 battalions of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] wore the badges of the regiment. As the threat of invasion receded, most of these home defence battalions were disbanded, the 8th and 70th in 1942, the 9th in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the 11th Battalion ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment when it was converted to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The 10th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942 and became the [[159th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|159th Regiment]] in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], though it retained the Glosters' cap badges. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it converted back to infantry and reverted to the regiment's 10th Battalion.<ref>Daniell pp. 289\u2013291, 310</ref>\n\n===Normandy landings and North-West Europe===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B15267.jpg|thumb|A soldier of Gloucestershire. Private G. Mills of the 2nd Battalion, 6&nbsp;March 1945.]]\nIn 1944, the 2nd Battalion was transferred to the [[56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|56th Independent Infantry Brigade]], and at 11:00 on 6&nbsp;June, during the [[Normandy landings]], the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at [[Gold Beach]]. The battalion saw action in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11&nbsp;June during [[Operation Perch]]; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30&nbsp;July during [[Operation Bluecoat]]; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12&nbsp;August in the prelude to [[Operation Tractable]].<ref>Daniell pp. 293\u2013300</ref> In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]], the 56th Brigade came under command of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], with which it remained for the rest of the war. During the advance to the River Seine, the 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing \u00c9paignes on 25&nbsp;August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2&nbsp;September. It spearheaded the [[Operation Astonia|assault on Le Havre]] eight days later, and it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, on 12&nbsp;September, capturing 1,500 prisoners and much beer for the loss during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 300\u2013302. Each man in the battalion received two bottles of beer on liberation of the fort's cellar. The battalion's quartermaster had to move fast to secure custody of the wine inventory before the quartermasters of other regiments arrived.</ref>\n\nFrom Le Havre, the 2nd Battalion advanced into Belgium, seeing action in the bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it fought at Stampersgat. The battalion reached Nijmegen in late November, where it spent over four relatively quiet months interrupted only by a four-day battle at Zetten in January 1945. The battalion's last significant action of the war came on 12&nbsp;April, when it assaulted across the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the rest of the 56th Brigade passed through to [[Liberation of Arnhem|capture the town itself]]. Following the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 8&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion entered Germany near Osnabr\u00fcck. It provided a detachment for the British guard at the [[Nuremberg trials]], and in August it was transferred to the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade|5th Guards Brigade]] stationed in Berlin. Between the Normandy landings on 6&nbsp;June 1944 and [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]] on 8&nbsp;May 1945 the battalion suffered 718 casualties. Among them was the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, died of wounds received during the attack at Stampersgat and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Bray (British Army officer)|Robert Bray]].<ref>Daniell pp. 302\u2013307</ref>\n\n===Burma Campaign 1944\u201345===\nOn reverting to the infantry role, the 10th Battalion was assigned to the [[72nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|72nd Brigade]] in the [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Division]]. The division was destined for [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|Burma]], and thus the battalion \"having been trained as infantry, tank troops, and combined-operations troops, went straight into jungle warfare, for which we had had no training\".<ref>Daniell p. 311. Quoting an officer of the battalion</ref> The Glosters arrived on the Arakan Peninsula (modern day Rakhine) in February 1944, were part of the relief effort in the [[Battle of the Admin Box]], and fought in dispersed, company-scale actions in the capture of the Mayu tunnels and Hambone Hill. The division went into reserve in May and was airlifted to Myitkyina in July, transferring to the [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under the American General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. It pushed south along the Mandalay railway and captured Taungni on 9&nbsp;August, during which period the 10th Battalion lost more men to sickness than enemy action. Brought back up to strength in September, the battalion was engaged in four days of fierce fighting at Pinwe in November, losing all the officers in both A and C Companies, and all but one in B Company, before being relieved on 26&nbsp;November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|title=Front Line Frankie & Vinegar Joe&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023231213/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 311\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe 36th Division continued its advance south in January 1945, and the 10th Battalion saw action in a series of short battles around Mabein that month. The battalion saw its last action of the war supporting the [[26th Indian Infantry Brigade|26th Indian Brigade]] attack at Myitson on the River Shweli, during which D Company was cut off for five days before the rest of the battalion was able to link up with it on 16&nbsp;February. Of the 250 or so men in the battalion before the battle, 119 were killed or wounded by the time the Japanese withdrew on 17&nbsp;February. Although the men had fought well, there were bitter recriminations over the conduct of the battle between the commander of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the 10th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which resulted in Butler being sacked. After reaching Mandalay, the battalion returned to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|title=The End of the War in South-East Asia&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024095433/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|archive-date=2017-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 320\u2013324</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nThe regiment accrued 20 different battle honours and lost 870 men killed in the nine battalions that had served under its colours during the Second World War.

That same year, the 1st Battalion was reduced to a cadre and returned from India to the UK, and the 2nd Battalion was posted to Jamaica and detached companies to Bermuda and British Honduras (modern day Belize). It was in Jamaica that, in accordance with the restructuring of the British Army, the regiment's two battalions swapped colours and amalgamated to form the single-battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21&nbsp;September 1948.<ref>Daniell pp. 325\u2013331</ref>\n\n==Korean War==\n[[File:Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nAfter its return to the UK in 1949, the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[James Carne]], was assigned to the [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group]], and on 3&nbsp;November 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the battalion arrived with the brigade in Korea.

On the first day of the battle, UN forces fell back to Line Kansas, but both the Koreans and the British were already on Line Kansas, and did not have as much leeway to fall back.

Against the four battalions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the [[63rd Army (People's Republic of China)|63rd Army]], comprising the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; some 27,000 men in 27 infantry battalions.<ref>Salmon pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\n====First night&nbsp;\u2013 attacks on A and D Companies and the F echelon====\n\nAt 22:00, a 17-man patrol from C Company in position on the river bank, supported by the guns of the 45th Field Regiment, engaged the leading Chinese troops three times as they attempted to cross the ford.

They were low on ammunition, though in their favour the 45th Field Regiment were still able to provide support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments).<ref>Salmon pp. 129, 203\u2013206</ref> The Glosters fought through the night of 24\u201325&nbsp;April, during which the peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill. It was recaptured in a counter-attack led by the [[adjutant]], Captain [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]], and the Chinese launched seven attacks in one hour in an attempt to take it again, all without success. Their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with the 45th Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support. Carne received permission to attempt a breakout at 06:05. He had no choice but to leave the wounded, estimated at some 100. The survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.<ref>Salmon pp. 206\u2013225</ref>\n\n====After the battle====\n\nThe Glosters' stand had plugged a large gap in the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would otherwise have left the flanks of the ROK 1st and US 3rd Divisions vulnerable. Their presence also threatened the rear of the Chinese forces as they advanced and denied them the use of routes south for their artillery and mule trains. General [[James Van Fleet]], commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]], described the stand as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\",<ref name=salmon-quotes>Salmon p. 314</ref> and in a letter to General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgeway]], commander-in-chief of UN forces in Korea, he wrote that \"the loss of 622 officers and men saved many times that number\".<ref name=salmon-quotes /> The 29th Brigade commander, Brigadier [[Thomas Brodie]], christened the regiment ''The Glorious Glosters'', a sobriquet that was repeated in the headlines of the day, and Hill 235 became known as ''Gloster Hill'', at the foot of which the [[Gloucester Valley Battle Monument]] was built in 1957.<ref>Salmon p. 307</ref><ref name=imjin /><ref>Daniell p. 375</ref>\n\nThe other battalions of the 29th Brigade had also been engaged in desperate fighting, though without the same scale of losses, and in total the brigade suffered 1,091 casualties.

But by that time, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] had prompted the government to [[Options for Change|restructure the armed forces]]. As a result, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]].

It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1694 and later became the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. It inherited the unique distinction in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its headdress as well as the front, a tradition that originated with the 28th Regiment after it fought in two ranks back to back at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two [[Regular army|regular]], two [[Militia (Great Britain)|militia]] and two [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer]] battalions, and saw its first action during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], the regiment's four auxiliary battalions were converted to three [[Territorial Force]] battalions and a [[Special Reserve]] battalion, and a further 18 battalions were added to the regiment's establishment during the war. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing a total of 8,100 men killed and winning 72 different [[battle honour]]s. Four awards of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. The wartime battalions were disbanded as the war ended, and just before the [[Second World War]], two of the territorial battalions were re-purposed and ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the remaining territorial battalion was duplicated, and another five battalions were raised on the outbreak of war, though most of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war progressed. Four battalions saw active service under the regiment's colours during the war. The 2nd and 5th Battalions both fought in the [[Battle of France]] and, after being lost almost in its entirety during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], the re-formed 2nd Battalion landed at [[Gold Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] and fought in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaign in North-West Europe. The 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], and the 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of Japanese forces during the [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, the hostilities-only battalions were disbanded and the 1st and 2nd Battalions were [[wikt:amalgamated|amalgamated]], leaving the regiment with one regular and one [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] battalion. It achieved fame during the [[Korean War]] when the 1st Battalion held out for three nights against overwhelming odds during the [[Battle of the Imjin River]]. The stand, described by the commander of the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea at the time as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\", prevented the encirclement of other United Nations forces, for which the regiment was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and earned the nickname ''The Glorious Glosters''. Two men serving with the regiment were awarded the VC for their actions in the battle. In the latter half of the 20th century, the regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion and completed tours of duty around the world, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, as well as in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]]. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which carried more battle honours on its [[Military colours, standards and guidons|colours]] than any other regiment of the line, was merged with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment inherited the back badge, and when it too was merged in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor, [[The Rifles]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Soldier of 28th regiment 1742.jpg|thumb|upright|Uniform of the 28th c.1742 with its yellow [[Facing colour|facings]]]]\n\nThe Gloucestershire Regiment traced its roots to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, raised in 1694 in Portsmouth,<ref>Daniell p. 3</ref> which first saw action in 1705 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 12</ref> Having been commanded by, and therefore named after, a succession of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and fought under this name during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 18</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|title=Bragg\u2019s Regiment and the 28th Foot&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230907/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another predecessor, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was formed in 1758 when the British Army was expanded during the [[Seven Years' War]].

For the first time the county of [[Gloucestershire]] was associated with both the 28th and 61st Regiments, which were renamed as the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|title=North and South Gloucestershire&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107013144/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Both regiments began to recruit from the county, and it was in Gloucester in December 1782 that the 61st Regiment was presented with new colours to replace those lost during the [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|Franco-Spanish invasion of Minorca]] earlier that year.<ref>Daniell p. 54</ref>\n\nIn March 1801, the 28th Regiment formed part of the British expeditionary force that landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to oppose [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] Army of the East. On 21&nbsp;March, during the [[Battle of Alexandria]], French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. With the men still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given for the rear rank to turn about, and standing thus in two ranks back to back, the regiment held the line. To commemorate this action, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress, a unique distinction in the British Army that was officially sanctioned in 1830.<ref>Daniell pp. 69\u201375</ref><ref name=Grazebrook>Grazebrook pp. 112\u2013113</ref>{{efn|The origins of the back badge and its initial form are not known; other than the honour \"Egypt\", awarded to all units, there is no record of a special badge being officially granted. An officer who served with the regiment between 1805 and 1807 wrote that the regiment \"acquired the emblem of the double front.\" In 1815, a staff officer witnessed the regiment marching out to Quatre Bras \"having their number both in front and rear of their low caps\u2014a memorial of Egypt.\" The first record of official recognition appears in an 1830 letter from the [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], which states that \"it was never the intention to deprive the 28th Regiment of any badge of honour they may have acquired by their distinguished service in Egypt, and that there will be no objection to their retaining the plate they have been accustomed to wear on the back of their caps since that service...\" This was officially confirmed in another letter dated 1843.

The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and added \"Alma\", \"Inkerman\" and \"Sevastopol\" to its legacy.<ref>Daniell ch.XIII\u2013XIV</ref>\n\nAnother thread that would be woven into the story of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the civilian administered auxiliary forces which supported the army in times of need. In the mid-18th century, county [[Militia (Great Britain)|militias]] were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and these were organised in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at [[Cecily Hill Barracks|Cirencester]].<ref>Daniell p. 26</ref> In 1859, county-based [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer rifle corps]] were raised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.<ref>Daniell pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Colours in Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|The regimental colours in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]\nIn 1872, the [[Cardwell Reforms]] began the process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line infantry regiments, a process that was completed by the [[Childers Reforms]] nine years later. As a result, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at [[Horfield Barracks]] in Bristol.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24992|pages=3300\u20133301|date=1 July 1881}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 186\u2013187.

It was a privilege that the 2nd Battalion did not want, but it was made palatable to the former 61st Regiment by replacing the number 28 with the Sphinx, a battle honour awarded to both predecessor regiments.<ref name=\"formation\"/> Although both battalions were forced to give up their individual [[facing colour]]s on their uniforms&nbsp;\u2013 yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st Regiment&nbsp;\u2013 when the government imposed a standard white across all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never accepted this change for their [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]]. Both battalions retained their former colours until 1929, when a compromise primrose yellow was finally chosen and a new regimental colour subsequently presented.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 188</ref>\n\nThe two battalions continued to refer to themselves by their former regimental numbers until they were merged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment became a single-battalion regiment. The 1st Battalion celebrated the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the anniversary of the Battle of Alexandria annually. The 2nd Battalion, on the other hand, held games followed by a dinner and a ball on the anniversary of the 61st Regiment's victory at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwallah]] on 13 January 1849 when overseas, or on the anniversary of that regiment's victory at [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]] on 22 July 1812 when at home.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 189</ref>\n\nThe new regiment acquired its march, ''The Kinnegad Slashers'', and its official nickname, ''Slashers'', from the 28th Regiment. The name arose from an incident in 1764, when members of the regiment allegedly slashed off part of the ear of a Montreal magistrate who had been harassing soldiers stationed in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was also sometimes referred to as ''The Old Braggs'', from Colonel [[Philip Bragg]], who commanded the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two other nicknames associated with the new regiment were inherited from the 61st Regiment; ''The Flowers of Toulouse'', from the scarlet uniforms of that regiment's many dead in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]], and ''The Silver-Tailed Dandies'', from the silver decorations on the longer-than-normal coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform.<ref>Daniell pp. 17, 41\u201342, 118, 178</ref>\n\n==Second Boer War==\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.

When the column came under fire near Rietfontein, the battalion was detached and ordered forward, but the order was ambiguous and the battalion advanced too far.

The troops moved out on the night of 29&nbsp;October with the intention to be in position before the main battle started, but they left too late to reach their objective before daybreak. As they took up an alternative position on the nearby Tchrengula Hill the pack-mules bolted, taking most of the heavy weaponry and ammunition with them. The Boers discovered the incursion at dawn and surrounded the position, and although the British held out for several hours they were forced to surrender at 12:30. The battalion lost 38 killed and 115 wounded, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Pretoria.<ref>Daniell pp. 191\u2013194</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|title=The Siege of Ladysmith&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013173326/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhile the remainder of the 1st Battalion helped in the defence of Ladysmith (the city was eventually [[relief of Ladysmith|relieved]] on 1&nbsp;March), the 2nd Battalion deployed to South Africa, arriving in January 1900. The battalion fought in the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], a nine-day battle which ended on 27&nbsp;February with the capture of the Boer general [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] and his force of some 4,000 men. On 15&nbsp;March, the battalion entered the Boer city of Bloemfontein, where it remained on garrison duties until 1904. The 1st Battalion, re-united when its POWs were liberated after the capture of Pretoria on 5&nbsp;July, was posted in August 1900 to Ceylon, where it remained until 1903 guarding Boer prisoners of war.<ref>Daniell pp. 194\u2013199, 203</ref>\n\nSome of the regiment's auxiliary battalions, which in 1900 were increased in number by the formation of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion,<ref name=\"Daniell p. 199\">Daniell p. 199</ref> also played a role in the war.

The battalion fought its first action on 8&nbsp;August in the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], during which it suffered over 820 casualties, including all of its officers, [[warrant officer]]s and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s. It was brought back up to strength and moved to Egypt in January 1916. In March, the 13th Division was transferred to Mesopotamia, but on landing at Basra the battalion was put out of action by an outbreak of [[Relapsing fever borreliosis|relapsing fever]]. It rejoined the division in the middle of April and fought in the unsuccessful attempt to lift the [[siege of Kut]]. The battalion saw action in December 1916 and February 1917 during the subsequent advance on and [[Second Battle of Kut|capture of Kut]], and fought its last battle on 29&nbsp;March 1917 during the [[Samarrah Offensive|Samarrah offensive]]. It spent the next 15 months mostly on defensive and garrison duties and was disbanded in September 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\n====8th Battalion====\n[[File:Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart by Sir William Orpen.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who won the Victoria Cross while commanding officer of the 8th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment]]\nThe 8th Battalion was raised in Bristol in September 1914. It arrived in France in July 1915 as part of the [[57th Brigade (United Kingdom)|57th Brigade]] in the [[19th (Western) Division]]<ref name=James /> and saw its first action the next year during the [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Battle of Albert]], in which it helped [[Capture of La Boisselle|capture La Boisselle]]. The division's 58th Brigade had captured the western half of the village on 2&nbsp;July, and the 8th Battalion [[North Staffordshire Regiment]] and 10th Battalion [[Worcestershire Regiment]], both of the 57th Brigade, assisted in the capture of the rest of the village the next day. A German counter-attack regained the eastern half of the village, and the 8th Glosters suffered 302 casualties when it fought alongside the 10th Battalion [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] to help retake it. During the battle, the Glosters' commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], assumed command of all four 57th Brigade battalions when the other three commanding officers became casualties, and for his actions in averting a serious reverse he was awarded the VC. Later the same month, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion made two unsuccessful attacks against the German line east of the village which together cost it 374 casualties, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major [[Lord Alexander Thynne|Lord A.G. Thynne]], both wounded. On 18&nbsp;November, the last day of the Somme offensive, the battalion suffered 295 casualties when it captured Grandcourt during the [[Battle of the Ancre]].<ref>Littlewood pp. 117\u2013118. Lt-Col de Wiart credited his award of the VC to 8th Battalion, \"for every man in the Battalion has done as much as I have\"</ref><ref>Daniell p. 223</ref>\n\nIn 1917, the 8th Battalion saw action in June during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], fought two minor actions in July near Oosttaverne, south of Ypres, and was involved in the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] in August. The battalion was next in action on the evening of 21&nbsp;March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive, when the Germans captured Doignies. Unable to recapture the village, the battalion blocked any further enemy progress until the morning of 23&nbsp;March, when German forces broke through on the left and threatened to outflank it. Company A fought to the last man covering the battalion's withdrawal, for which action the company commander, Captain [[Manley Angell James]], was awarded the VC. By the time the 19th Division withdrew to Doullens on 28&nbsp;March the battalion had suffered 323 casualties.<ref>Littlewood pp. 119\u2013121, 185</ref> In April, the battalion fought in three engagements of the Battle of the Lys: the Battles of Messines, Bailleul and First Kemmel. The following month, the 19th Division's parent unit, [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], was transferred to the French Sixth Army. The division was supposed to rest and re-organise in a quiet sector, but on 27&nbsp;May the Germans launched a major attack, ensnaring the 8th Battalion in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne]]. The battalion saw its last action in October, during the Battle of the Selle, and was disbanded in May 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 121\u2013122</ref>\n\n====9th Battalion====\nThe 9th Battalion was formed in Bristol in September 1914 and reached France in September 1915 as part of the [[78th Brigade (United Kingdom)|78th Brigade]] in the [[26th Division (United Kingdom)|26th Division]].<ref name=James /> The division was transferred to XII Corps of the British Salonika Army in November 1915, and the battalion held the line around Tumba, north of Salonika, until July 1916, when the division relieved the French south of Lake Dojran. The battalion participated in two attacks against the Bulgarian lines, on 25&nbsp;April and 8&nbsp;May 1917, during the [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Battle of Dojran]]. In July 1918, the battalion was transferred to the [[198th (East Lancashire) Brigade|198th Brigade]] of the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Division]] in France, becoming the divisional pioneers, and was disbanded in November 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n====10th Battalion====\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=My word, as soon as the order was given the Gloucesters were out and over the parapet and soon doing great havoc among the Germans.\n|author=Unnamed lance-corporal, 10th Battalion<br />Battle of Loos<ref>Daniell p. 209</ref>}}\nThe 10th Battalion was raised in September 1914 in Bristol, but was recruited mainly by volunteers from Cheltenham.<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 139</ref> It crossed to France in August 1915 and replaced one of the Guards battalions in the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Brigade]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]].

On 23&nbsp;July 1916, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion attacked the German line east of the village, and was involved in two further attacks in the same area in August, all without success. The battalion's last action of the war came on 9&nbsp;September, in a failed attack on High Wood which cost it 122 casualties. In 1917, the 1st Division was allocated to Operation Hush, and when that was cancelled the 10th battalion moved to the Ypres area. It was disbanded in February 1918 and its men distributed among the regiment's 1st and 8th Battalions and the 13th Entrenching Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 139\u2013141</ref><ref>Westlake p. 137</ref>\n\n====12th Battalion (Bristol's Own)====\n{{main|12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol's Own)}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Somme, July-november 1916 Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Battalion troops move up during the Battle of Morval]]\nThe 12th Battalion was raised in Bristol in August 1914 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee.

The division returned to France in April 1918, occupying positions in the line near Nieppe Forest, and the battalion saw action on 25&nbsp;April and 28&nbsp;June, both times successfully advancing the front line. Its last action came during the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]], where it suffered some 100 casualties on 21&nbsp;August but succeeded in capturing [[Irles]] on 23&nbsp;August. On 6&nbsp;October, the battalion was disbanded and its men distributed among the other units of the 5th Division.<ref>Littlewood pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n====13th Battalion (Forest of Dean)====\nThe 13th Battalion was raised in December 1914 at Malvern by [[Sir Henry Webb, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Webb]] and recruited from the miners of the Forest of Dean, South Wales and the Durham coalfields. In July 1915, it was taken over by the War Office and went to France in March 1916 as divisional pioneers to the [[39th Division (United Kingdom)|39th Division]].<ref name=James /> The battalion saw its first significant action on 30&nbsp;June 1916, during the [[Battle of the Boar's Head]], when it dug communication trenches behind the assaulting troops. On several occasions during the battle the pioneers had to stop digging to defend themselves, and the battalion suffered 71 casualties. It saw action again towards the end of 1916 during operations on the Ancre, including the [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]] and the Battle of the Ancre. In March 1918, the battalion suffered particularly badly in the opening week of the [[German Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], during which it was required to take positions in the line as infantry, and by the time the division was withdrawn on 31&nbsp;March the battalion had sustained 326 casualties. In April, the survivors were allocated to composite infantry battalions and saw their last action on 26&nbsp;April during the Second Battle of Kemmel, part of the Battle of the Lys, after which the battalion was reduced to a training cadre.<ref>Littlewood pp. 159\u2013162</ref>\n\n====14th Battalion (West of England)====\nThe 14th Battalion was a [[Bantam (military)|bantam]] unit of volunteers from Bristol and Birmingham who had previously been rejected for service because of their short height. It was raised in April 1915 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee, adopted by the War Office in June 1915, and departed for France in January 1916 as part of the [[105th Brigade (United Kingdom)|105th Brigade]] in the [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]].<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 167</ref> The battalion went into the line in March, where the men's first task was to raise the height of the [[wikt:fire step|firing step]],<ref>Daniell pp. 225\u2013226</ref> and its first significant action came on 8&nbsp;June, when it conducted a large raid south-east of Neuve Chapelle. In July, following the [[capture of Tr\u00f4nes Wood]] by the 18th Division during the Battle of Bazentin, the battalion moved into the line at the northern end of the wood where, on 19&nbsp;July, it suffered 107 casualties to enemy artillery.<ref>Westlake p. 138</ref> On 21&nbsp;August 1917, while in the line near \u00c9pehy, the Germans attacked one of the battalion's bombing posts. Although his bombing party were driven back, Second-Lieutenant [[Hardy Falconer Parsons]] remained and prevented the enemy from entering the trenches, for which act he was posthumously awarded the VC. The battalion fought in the Action of 22&nbsp;October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw its last action on 4&nbsp;February 1918, when it successfully attacked a fortified farm in the Ypres sector. Seven days later the battalion was disbanded and its men transferred to the 13th Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 167\u2013170</ref>\n\n====18th Battalion====\nThe 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], and decamped to France in August 1918 as part of the [[49th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division|16th Division]]. It went into action on 11&nbsp;September, when it successfully assaulted the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its last action on 18&nbsp;September, when a German attack drove A Company from its forward posts. The battalion was disbanded in June 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Fifth Gloucester Gazette===\n[[File:Lieutenant FW Harvey DCM.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant F. W.

The 1st Battalion completed tours of duty in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican [[Se\u00e1n Moylan]], and Germany, which counted as a home posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In 1928, the 2nd Battalion returned to the UK and the 1st Battalion was posted overseas, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938.<ref>Daniell pp. 232\u2013235</ref> Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937.<ref>Daniell p. 237</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|title=Egypt and Preparation for War|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163707/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|archive-date=2017-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, the 5th Battalion became the regiment's sole territorial unit when the 4th Battalion was converted to the [[66th (Gloucesters) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (RA), and the 6th Battalion converted to the [[44th Royal Tank Regiment|44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Daniell p. 239</ref> On the eve of the [[Second World War]], the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and the 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line duplicate of the 5th Battalion.<ref>Daniell p. 425</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:\n* 1st Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 stationed around Rangoon in Burma<ref>Daniell p. 265</ref>\n* 2nd Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]] in the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]<ref>Joslen p. 246</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#5th_Gloucesters|5th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 144th Infantry Brigade in the 48th Division<ref>Joslen p. 329</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#7th_Gloucesters|7th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 183rd Infantry Brigade in the 61st Division<ref>Joslen p. 376</ref>\n\n===Battle of France===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=Completely surrounded, with our lack of weapons there was only one thing to do.

The 5th Battalion marched {{convert|95|mi|km|-1}} in 83 hours with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in a matter of minutes to an airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20&nbsp;May, when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) for two days before the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] resumed its retreat. On 25&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of Somer Force. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the [[Battle of Dunkirk|outer perimeter around Dunkirk]]. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27&nbsp;May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29&nbsp;May, but few made it to Dunkirk. The 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties at Cassel, 484 of them POWs.<ref>Daniell pp. 251\u2013259</ref> Meanwhile, the 5th Battalion was given a similar task at the villages of Arneke and Ledringhem, some {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26&nbsp;May, and the first attacks came the next day. By 28&nbsp;May, the battalion had concentrated at Ledringhem, where it was surrounded, and it withdrew under orders in the early hours of 29&nbsp;May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day and were subsequently taken off the beach by [[Little Ships of Dunkirk|little ships]]. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.<ref>Daniell pp. 260\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Retreat from Rangoon===\n[[File:Japanese Conquest of Burma April-May 1942.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Japanese Conquest of Burma April\u2013May 1942]]\nIn March 1942, the 1st Battalion provided the rearguard for the British retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. It saw its first significant action of the war on 7 and 8&nbsp;March at the [[Taukkyan Roadblock]], and for the rest of the month operated independently to cover the retreat, fighting battles at Letpadan on 17&nbsp;March and Paungde on 27&nbsp;March. In a subsequent battle near Padigong, {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from Paungde, D Company became isolated for 17 hours and had to fight its way back to the battalion at Shwedaung. In the meantime, the battalion became part of the [[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]] in the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Infantry Division]], which had to fight its way to and through Shwedaung when Japanese forces infiltrated between the rearguard and the main column. By the end of March, the 1st Battalion had been reduced to 140 all ranks, its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 270\u2013280</ref>\n\nIn mid-April, the under-strength battalion became so dispersed while protecting demolition parties at oil installations around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot returned from hospital he was informed the battalion had ceased to exist. He was nevertheless able to gather the remnants, now numbering 7 officers and 170 other ranks, at Shwebo on 27&nbsp;April, and the battalion was subsequently reinforced by a draft of 3 officers and 120 other ranks. When the Japanese threatened Monywa, Bagot took command of all the troops in the area, which included the 1st Battalion, to form Bagot Force. This mixed group of units fought a delaying action at Budalin, {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} north of Monywa, on 4&nbsp;May before withdrawing to Ye-u. The battalion continued to act as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9&nbsp;May and into India at Tamu at the end of the month.<ref>Daniell pp. 280\u2013286</ref> At the same time, the Japanese halted operations in Burma. Since the start of the retreat from Rangoon on 7&nbsp;March the battalion had lost 8 officers and 156 other ranks killed in action or died of sickness, and many more wounded.<ref>Daniell p. 285</ref> The battalion was rested and brought back up to strength in India, where it spent the remainder of the war, and saw no further action.<ref>Daniell pp. 308\u2013309</ref>\n\n===Home front===\nOn its return to the UK, the 5th Battalion was brought back up to strength and manned coastal defences in Cornwall. It converted to a reconnaissance role in June 1941, eventually becoming the [[43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment]], and from October it ceased to have any affiliation with the Gloucestershire Regiment.<ref>Daniell pp. 288\u2013289</ref><ref>Joslen p. 69</ref> Its duplicate, the 7th Battalion, was posted to Northern Ireland, but saw no action and became a training unit in 1944.<ref>Daniell p. 289</ref> With so many of its men languishing in POW camps, the 2nd Battalion was rebuilt and served in home defence at various locations around the UK, finally ending up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being assigned to a more active role.<ref>Daniell pp. 288, 292</ref>\n\nAs the UK braced itself for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German plan to invade, a number of [[Home Service Battalions|home defence]] battalions were raised under the regiment's colours. The 8th Battalion was formed from the [[National Defence Companies]] and consisted of men too old, too young or unfit for active service, and the younger contingent from this battalion later formed the 70th Battalion. The 9th and 10th Battalions were also raised, the former serving in Northern Ireland, the latter in south Wales and then Lincolnshire. The 11th Battalion was created in October 1940 from a re-designation of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 battalions of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] wore the badges of the regiment. As the threat of invasion receded, most of these home defence battalions were disbanded, the 8th and 70th in 1942, the 9th in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the 11th Battalion ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment when it was converted to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The 10th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942 and became the [[159th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|159th Regiment]] in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], though it retained the Glosters' cap badges. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it converted back to infantry and reverted to the regiment's 10th Battalion.<ref>Daniell pp. 289\u2013291, 310</ref>\n\n===Normandy landings and North-West Europe===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B15267.jpg|thumb|A soldier of Gloucestershire. Private G. Mills of the 2nd Battalion, 6&nbsp;March 1945.]]\nIn 1944, the 2nd Battalion was transferred to the [[56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|56th Independent Infantry Brigade]], and at 11:00 on 6&nbsp;June, during the [[Normandy landings]], the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at [[Gold Beach]]. The battalion saw action in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11&nbsp;June during [[Operation Perch]]; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30&nbsp;July during [[Operation Bluecoat]]; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12&nbsp;August in the prelude to [[Operation Tractable]].<ref>Daniell pp. 293\u2013300</ref> In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]], the 56th Brigade came under command of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], with which it remained for the rest of the war. During the advance to the River Seine, the 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing \u00c9paignes on 25&nbsp;August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2&nbsp;September. It spearheaded the [[Operation Astonia|assault on Le Havre]] eight days later, and it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, on 12&nbsp;September, capturing 1,500 prisoners and much beer for the loss during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 300\u2013302. Each man in the battalion received two bottles of beer on liberation of the fort's cellar. The battalion's quartermaster had to move fast to secure custody of the wine inventory before the quartermasters of other regiments arrived.</ref>\n\nFrom Le Havre, the 2nd Battalion advanced into Belgium, seeing action in the bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it fought at Stampersgat. The battalion reached Nijmegen in late November, where it spent over four relatively quiet months interrupted only by a four-day battle at Zetten in January 1945. The battalion's last significant action of the war came on 12&nbsp;April, when it assaulted across the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the rest of the 56th Brigade passed through to [[Liberation of Arnhem|capture the town itself]]. Following the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 8&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion entered Germany near Osnabr\u00fcck. It provided a detachment for the British guard at the [[Nuremberg trials]], and in August it was transferred to the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade|5th Guards Brigade]] stationed in Berlin. Between the Normandy landings on 6&nbsp;June 1944 and [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]] on 8&nbsp;May 1945 the battalion suffered 718 casualties. Among them was the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, died of wounds received during the attack at Stampersgat and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Bray (British Army officer)|Robert Bray]].<ref>Daniell pp. 302\u2013307</ref>\n\n===Burma Campaign 1944\u201345===\nOn reverting to the infantry role, the 10th Battalion was assigned to the [[72nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|72nd Brigade]] in the [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Division]]. The division was destined for [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|Burma]], and thus the battalion \"having been trained as infantry, tank troops, and combined-operations troops, went straight into jungle warfare, for which we had had no training\".<ref>Daniell p. 311. Quoting an officer of the battalion</ref> The Glosters arrived on the Arakan Peninsula (modern day Rakhine) in February 1944, were part of the relief effort in the [[Battle of the Admin Box]], and fought in dispersed, company-scale actions in the capture of the Mayu tunnels and Hambone Hill. The division went into reserve in May and was airlifted to Myitkyina in July, transferring to the [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under the American General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. It pushed south along the Mandalay railway and captured Taungni on 9&nbsp;August, during which period the 10th Battalion lost more men to sickness than enemy action. Brought back up to strength in September, the battalion was engaged in four days of fierce fighting at Pinwe in November, losing all the officers in both A and C Companies, and all but one in B Company, before being relieved on 26&nbsp;November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|title=Front Line Frankie & Vinegar Joe&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023231213/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 311\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe 36th Division continued its advance south in January 1945, and the 10th Battalion saw action in a series of short battles around Mabein that month. The battalion saw its last action of the war supporting the [[26th Indian Infantry Brigade|26th Indian Brigade]] attack at Myitson on the River Shweli, during which D Company was cut off for five days before the rest of the battalion was able to link up with it on 16&nbsp;February. Of the 250 or so men in the battalion before the battle, 119 were killed or wounded by the time the Japanese withdrew on 17&nbsp;February. Although the men had fought well, there were bitter recriminations over the conduct of the battle between the commander of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the 10th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which resulted in Butler being sacked. After reaching Mandalay, the battalion returned to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|title=The End of the War in South-East Asia&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024095433/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|archive-date=2017-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 320\u2013324</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nThe regiment accrued 20 different battle honours and lost 870 men killed in the nine battalions that had served under its colours during the Second World War.

That same year, the 1st Battalion was reduced to a cadre and returned from India to the UK, and the 2nd Battalion was posted to Jamaica and detached companies to Bermuda and British Honduras (modern day Belize). It was in Jamaica that, in accordance with the restructuring of the British Army, the regiment's two battalions swapped colours and amalgamated to form the single-battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21&nbsp;September 1948.<ref>Daniell pp. 325\u2013331</ref>\n\n==Korean War==\n[[File:Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nAfter its return to the UK in 1949, the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[James Carne]], was assigned to the [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group]], and on 3&nbsp;November 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the battalion arrived with the brigade in Korea.

On the first day of the battle, UN forces fell back to Line Kansas, but both the Koreans and the British were already on Line Kansas, and did not have as much leeway to fall back.

Against the four battalions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the [[63rd Army (People's Republic of China)|63rd Army]], comprising the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; some 27,000 men in 27 infantry battalions.<ref>Salmon pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\n====First night&nbsp;\u2013 attacks on A and D Companies and the F echelon====\n\nAt 22:00, a 17-man patrol from C Company in position on the river bank, supported by the guns of the 45th Field Regiment, engaged the leading Chinese troops three times as they attempted to cross the ford.

They were low on ammunition, though in their favour the 45th Field Regiment were still able to provide support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments).<ref>Salmon pp. 129, 203\u2013206</ref> The Glosters fought through the night of 24\u201325&nbsp;April, during which the peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill. It was recaptured in a counter-attack led by the [[adjutant]], Captain [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]], and the Chinese launched seven attacks in one hour in an attempt to take it again, all without success. Their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with the 45th Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support. Carne received permission to attempt a breakout at 06:05. He had no choice but to leave the wounded, estimated at some 100. The survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.<ref>Salmon pp. 206\u2013225</ref>\n\n====After the battle====\n\nThe Glosters' stand had plugged a large gap in the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would otherwise have left the flanks of the ROK 1st and US 3rd Divisions vulnerable. Their presence also threatened the rear of the Chinese forces as they advanced and denied them the use of routes south for their artillery and mule trains. General [[James Van Fleet]], commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]], described the stand as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\",<ref name=salmon-quotes>Salmon p. 314</ref> and in a letter to General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgeway]], commander-in-chief of UN forces in Korea, he wrote that \"the loss of 622 officers and men saved many times that number\".<ref name=salmon-quotes /> The 29th Brigade commander, Brigadier [[Thomas Brodie]], christened the regiment ''The Glorious Glosters'', a sobriquet that was repeated in the headlines of the day, and Hill 235 became known as ''Gloster Hill'', at the foot of which the [[Gloucester Valley Battle Monument]] was built in 1957.<ref>Salmon p. 307</ref><ref name=imjin /><ref>Daniell p. 375</ref>\n\nThe other battalions of the 29th Brigade had also been engaged in desperate fighting, though without the same scale of losses, and in total the brigade suffered 1,091 casualties.

But by that time, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] had prompted the government to [[Options for Change|restructure the armed forces]]. As a result, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]].

[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.17% of the population.\n\nThere were 436 households out of which 38.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 70.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.3% were non-families. 14.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 2.98.\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 26.8% under the age of 18, 6.0% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 26.3% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $41,957, and the median income for a family was $44,291. Males had a median income of $32,931 versus $30,515 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the CDP was $17,139.  About 1.9% of families and 2.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including none of those under age 18 and 5.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Dickinson County, Michigan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Dickinson County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Iron Mountain micropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Dickinson County, Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "Notorious4life", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnesec,_Michigan"}

In these cases, one of the strategies shown below for assigning the rankings may be adopted. \nA common shorthand way to distinguish these ranking strategies is by the ranking numbers that would be produced for four items, with the first item ranked ahead of the second and third (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of the fourth. These names are also shown below.\n\n=== Standard competition ranking (\"1224\" ranking) ===\nIn competition ranking, items that compare equal receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers. The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap is one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it. This ranking strategy is frequently adopted for competitions, as it means that if two (or more) competitors tie for a position in the ranking, the position of all those ranked below them is unaffected (i.e., a competitor only comes second if exactly one person scores better than them, third if exactly two people score better than them, fourth if exactly three people score better than them, etc.).\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\"), C also gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\").\n\n=== Modified competition ranking (\"1334\" ranking) ===\nSometimes, competition ranking is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers ''before'' the sets of equal-ranking items (rather than after them as in standard competition ranking).{{where|date=July 2016}} The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal to it or above it. This ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if they score higher than all but one of their opponents, third if they score higher than all but two of their opponents, etc.\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked head of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 3 (\"joint third\"), C also gets ranking number 3 (\"joint third\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\"). In this case, nobody would get ranking number 2 (\"second\") and that would be left as a gap.\n\n=== Dense ranking (\"1223\" ranking) ===\nIn dense ranking, items that compare equally receive the same ranking number, and the next item(s) receive the immediately following ranking number. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it that are distinct with respect to the ranking order.\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\"), C also gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\") and D gets ranking number 3 (\"Third\").\n\n=== Ordinal ranking (\"1234\" ranking) ===\nIn ordinal ranking, all items receive distinct ordinal numbers, including items that compare equal. The assignment of distinct ordinal numbers to items that compare equal can be done at random, or arbitrarily, but it is generally preferable to use a system that is arbitrary but consistent, as this gives stable results if the ranking is done multiple times. An example of an arbitrary but consistent system would be to incorporate other attributes into the ranking order (such as alphabetical ordering of the competitor's name) to ensure that no two items exactly match.\n\nWith this strategy, if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\"), and '''either''' B gets ranking number 2 (\"second\") and C gets ranking number 3 (\"third\") '''or''' C gets ranking number 2 (\"second\") and B gets ranking number 3 (\"third\").\n\nIn computer data processing, ordinal ranking is also referred to as \"row numbering\".\n\n=== Fractional ranking (\"1 2.5 2.5 4\" ranking) ===\nItems that compare equal receive the same ranking number, which is the [[mean]] of what they would have under ordinal rankings. Equivalently, the ranking number of 1 plus the number of items ranked above it plus half the number of items equal to it. This strategy has the property that the sum of the ranking numbers is the same as under ordinal ranking. For this reason, it is used in computing [[Borda count]]s and in statistical tests (see below).\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B and C each get ranking number 2.5 (average of \"joint second/third\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\").\n\nHere is an example: \nSuppose you have the data set 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0.\n\nThe ordinal ranks are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nFor v = 1.0, the fractional rank is the average of the ordinal ranks: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5.\nIn a similar manner, for v = 5.0, the fractional rank is (7 + 8 + 9) / 3 = 8.0.\n\nThus the fractional ranks are: 1.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 6.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0\n\n== Ranking in statistics ==\nIn [[statistics]], ranking is the [[data transformation (statistics)|data transformation]] in which [[number|numerical]] or [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] values are replaced by their rank when the data are sorted. For example, the numerical data 3.4, 5.1, 2.6, 7.3 are observed, the ranks of these data items would be 2, 3, 1 and 4 respectively. For example, the ordinal data hot, cold, warm would be replaced by 3, 1, 2. In these examples, the ranks are assigned to values in ascending order. (In some other cases, descending ranks are used.) Ranks are related to the indexed list of [[order statistics]], which consists of the original dataset rearranged into ascending order.\n\nSome kinds of [[statistical test]]s employ calculations based on ranks. Examples include:\n\n* [[Friedman test]]\n* [[Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way analysis of variance|Kruskal\u2013Wallis test]]\n* [[Rank product]]s\n* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]]\n* [[Wilcoxon rank-sum test]]\n* [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test]]\n\nThe distribution of values in decreasing order of rank is often of interest when values vary widely in scale; this is the [[rank-size distribution]] (or rank-frequency distribution), for example for city sizes or word frequencies. These often follow a [[power law]].\n\nSome ranks can have non-integer values for tied data values. For example, when there is an even number of copies of the same data value, the above described [[#Fractional ranking (\"1 2.5 2.5 4\" ranking)|fractional statistical rank]] of the tied data ends in \u00bd.\n\n=== Rank function in Excel ===\n[[Microsoft Excel]] provides two ranking functions, the '''Rank.EQ''' function which assigns competition ranks (\"1224\") and the '''Rank.AVG''' function which assigns fractional ranks (\"1 2.5 2.5 4\") as described above.\n\n=== Comparison of rankings ===\nA [[rank correlation]] can be used to compare two rankings for the same set of objects. For example, [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] is useful to measure the statistical dependence between the rankings of athletes in two tournaments.

In other words, the holders of [[senior debt]] would be paid out before [[subordinated debt]] holders received any funds.\n* [[Search engine]]s rank web pages by their expected [[relevance]] to a user's query using a combination of query-dependent and query-independent methods. Query-independent methods attempt to measure the estimated importance of a page, independent of any consideration of how well it matches the specific query.

Query-dependent methods attempt to measure the degree to which a page matches a specific query, independent of the importance of the page.

Another example is the \"Rank\u2013rank hypergeometric overlap\" approach<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plaisier|first1=Seema B.|last2=Taschereau|first2=Richard|last3=Wong|first3=Justin A.|last4=Graeber|first4=Thomas G.|title=Rank\u2013rank hypergeometric overlap: identification of statistically significant overlap between gene-expression signatures|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=September 2010|volume=38|issue=17|pages=e169|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq636|pmid=20660011|pmc=2943622}}</ref>, which is designed to compare ranking of the genes that are at the \"top\" of two ordered lists of differentially expressed genes.\n\n== Examples of ranking ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n* In [[politics]], rankings focus on the comparison of economic, social, environmental and governance performance of countries, see [[List of international rankings]].\n* In many [[sport]]s, individuals or teams are given rankings, generally by the sport's [[Sports governing body|governing body]].\n** In [[association football]] (soccer), national teams are ranked in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|Women's World Rankings]] and, unofficially, in the [[World Football Elo Ratings]].\n** In the [[Olympic Games]], each member country ([[National Olympic Committee|NOC]]) is ranked based upon gold, silver and bronze medal counts in the [[Olympic medal table|Olympic medal rankings]].\n** In [[basketball]], national teams are ranked in the [[FIBA World Rankings]] and the [[FIBA Women's World Ranking|Women's World Rankings]].\n** In [[baseball]] and [[softball]], national teams are ranked in the [[WBSC World Rankings]].\n** In [[ice hockey]], national teams are ranked in the [[IIHF World Ranking]].\n** In [[golf]], the top male golfers are ranked using the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], and the top female golfers are ranked using the [[Women's World Golf Rankings]].\n** In [[snooker]], players are ranked using the [[Snooker world rankings]].\n** In [[tennis]], male and female players are ranked using the [[ATP Rankings]] and [[WTA Rankings]] respectively, whilst the [[ITF Rankings]] are used for national [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] teams.\n** In [[road bicycle racing]], male cyclists have been ranked using the [[UCI World Ranking]] from 2016, having previously been ranked using the [[UCI Road World Rankings]] from 1984 to 2004. Female cyclists have been ranked using the [[UCI Women's Road World Rankings]] since 1994.\n** In [[track cycling]] riders and nations are ranked using the [[UCI Track Cycling World Ranking]]\n** In [[chess]], players are ranked using the [[FIDE World Rankings]].\n** In [[sailing]], boats are scored directly using the sum of the ranking.\n** In [[Bridge (game)|bridge]], matchpoint scoring uses fractional ranking to assign the score.\n* In relation to [[Credit (finance)|credit]] standing, the ranking of a security refers to where that particular security would stand in a [[Liquidation|wind up]] of the issuing company, i.e., its [[seniority (finance)|seniority]] in the company's [[capital structure]]. For instance, [[capital note]]s are subordinated securities; they would rank behind senior debt in a wind up. In other words, the holders of [[senior debt]] would be paid out before [[subordinated debt]] holders received any funds.\n* [[Search engine]]s rank web pages by their expected [[relevance]] to a user's query using a combination of query-dependent and query-independent methods. Query-independent methods attempt to measure the estimated importance of a page, independent of any consideration of how well it matches the specific query. Query-independent ranking is usually based on link analysis; examples include the [[HITS algorithm]], [[PageRank]] and [[TrustRank]]. Query-dependent methods attempt to measure the degree to which a page matches a specific query, independent of the importance of the page. Query-dependent ranking is usually based on [[heuristic]]s that consider the number and locations of matches of the various query words on the page itself, in the [[URL]] or in any [[anchor text]] referring to the page.\n* In [[Webometrics]] it is possible to rank institutions according to their presence in the web (number of webpages) and the impact of these contents (external inlinks=site citations), such as the [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]]\n* In [[video gaming]], players may be given a ranking. To \"[[rank up]]\" is to achieve a higher ranking relative to other players, especially with strategies that do not depend on the player's skill.\n* The [[TrueSkill]] ranking system is a skill based ranking system for Xbox Live developed at Microsoft Research\n* A [[bibliogram]] ranks common noun phrases in a piece of text.\n* In language, the status of an item (usually through what is known as \"downranking\" or \"rank-shifting\") in relation to the uppermost rank in a clause; for example, in the sentence \"I want to eat the cake you made today\", \"eat\" is on the uppermost rank, but \"made\" is downranked as part of the nominal group \"the cake you made today\"; this nominal group behaves as though it were a single noun (i.e., I want to eat ''it''), and thus the verb within it (\"made\") is ranked differently from \"eat\".\n* [[Academic journal#Ranking|Academic journal]]s are sometimes ranked according to [[impact factor]]; the number of later articles that cite articles in a given journal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[League table]]\n* [[Ordinal data]]\n* [[Rating (disambiguation)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|ranking}}\n*[https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/70301-ranknum RANKNUM, a Matlab function to compute the five types of ranks]\n*[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=19496 Matlab Toolbox with functions to compute ranks]\n* [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/default.aspx TrueSkill Ranking System]\n* [https://github.com/quidproquo/ranker Ranking Library written in Ruby]\n* [http://www.dataworldwide.org/websites/data_indexes.htm List of Global Development Indexes and Rankings]\n\n{{statistics|inference|collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Nonparametric statistics]]\n[[Category:Rankings| ]]<!-- most of these are not 'mathematical' -->\n[[Category:Comparison (mathematical)]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4061:41e:91ec::1d3:b0ac", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking"}
