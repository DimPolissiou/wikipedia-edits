It is very reminiscent of the Windows XP operating system.\n\nIt featured the \"Naenara\" web browser, based on Mozilla Firefox, and an Office suite based on Open Office, called \"Uri 2.0\". Wine is also included.\n\nUnfortunately, no copies have leaked online. The screenshots of the operating system were officially published by KCNA and discovered by South Korean news sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/04/123_63669.html|title=NK Goes for Linux-Based Operating System|author=Kim Tong-hyung|date=5 April 2010|work=Korea Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Version 2.0 ===\nThe development of version 2.0 began in March 2008, and was completed on June 3, 2009. Like its predecessor, it is based on the appearance of Windows XP, and was priced at 2000 [[North Korean won]] (approx. US$15).\n\nThe \"Naenara\" internet browser is also included in this version. The browser was released on August 6, 2009, as part of the operating system, and was priced at 4000 North Korean won (approx. US$28).\n\nThe operating system uses a special keyboard layout that differs greatly from the South Korean standard layout.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Version 3.0 ===\nVersion 3.0 was introduced on April 15, 2012, and looks most reminiscent of [[macOS]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/12/30/red-star-3-0-desktop-finally-becomes-public/|title=Red Star 3.0 Desktop finally becomes public|last=Williams|first=Martyn|date=2014-12-30|website=North Korea Tech - \ub178\uc2a4\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud14c\ud06c|access-date=2017-08-31}}</ref> The new version supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\nThe operating system comes pre-installed with a number of applications that monitor its users--if a user tries to disable security functions, the operating system often restarts in continuous loops or destroys itself. In addition, a watermarking tool integrated into the system marks all media content with the hard drive's serial number. This makes it possible for the North Korean authorities to trace the spread of files. The system also has hidden \"anti-virus\" software that is capable of removing censored files that are remotely stored by the North Korean secret service. There is a user group called \"[[superuser|administrator]]\" in the operating system. Users, however, can't gain full system access, even if they're administrators, as commands such as [[sudo]] and su are not available.<ref name=\"chaos\" />\n\n=== Version 4.0 ===\nVery little information is available on version 4.0.\n\nAs of late 2017 it is known that a Red Star 4.0 exists and is being field tested.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htecm/20171014.aspx|title=Electronic Weapons: Two Lines, No Waiting|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\nA server variation of version 4.0 appears to be currently used on the website of North Korea's national airline [[Air Koryo]], [[Voice of Korea]], and ''[[The Pyongyang Times]]'' according to the HTTP server header.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.airkoryo.com.kp/|title=Air Koryo|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/|title=The Pyongyang Times|access-date=2018-12-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The Pyongyang Times]]'', an official version of Red Star OS 4.0 has been developed as of January 2019, with full network support as well as system and service management tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/pdf/2019/02/6.pdf|title=The Pyongyang Times}}</ref>\n\n== Vulnerabilities ==\nIn 2016, the security company Hackerhouse found a security vulnerability in the integrated web browser Naenara.

The system also has hidden \"anti-virus\" software that is capable of removing censored files that are remotely stored by the North Korean secret service.

She is voiced by [[Kristen Bell]] as an adult. At the beginning of the film, Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provide her speaking and singing voice as a young child, respectively. Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing). In ''Frozen II'', Hadley Gannaway provided her voice as a young child while Stubenrauch is the archive audio.\n\nCreated by co-directors [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]] and [[Chris Buck]], Anna is loosely based on Gerda, a character from the Danish fairytale \"[[The Snow Queen]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. In the Disney film adaptation, Anna is depicted as the princess of Arendelle, a fictional [[Scandinavia]]n kingdom, and the younger sister of [[Elsa (Frozen)|Princess Elsa]] ([[Idina Menzel]]), who is the heiress to the throne and possesses the elemental ability to create and control ice and snow. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom after inadvertently sending Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation, fearless and faithful Anna is determined to set out on a dangerous adventure to bring her sister back and save both her kingdom and her family.\n\nThe original fairytale in general and the character of the Snow Queen in particular posed long-term problems to adapt into a feature-length production. Several film executives, including [[Walt Disney]], made their attempts towards the story and numerous adaptations were shelved as the filmmakers could not work out the characters. Finally, directors Buck and Lee solved the issue by portraying Anna and Elsa as sisters, establishing a dynamic relationship between the characters.\n\nFilm critics praised Anna's determination and enthusiasm in her personality and Bell for her performance in the films.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins and conception===\n[[File:Page 94 of Andersen's fairy tales (Robinson).png|thumbnail|left|250px|An illustration of Gerda, the character Anna is based upon.]]\nAttempts to produce an adaption of \"[[The Snow Queen]]\" in the Disney studio dated back to 1943, when [[Walt Disney]] considered collaborating with [[Samuel Goldwyn]] to produce a biography film of Hans Christian Andersen. However, the story and particularly the Snow Queen [[Character (arts)|character]] proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators. Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main [[protagonist]], Gerda (who later served as an inspiration for Anna), and the Snow Queen. Most obviously, Andersen's version did not feature any confrontation between them: when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay, the Snow Queen is nowhere to be seen. There just was not enough character conflict to form a full-length feature.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">{{cite news|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx#.UmbFXxZPrTQ |title=Countdown to Disney \"Frozen\" : How one simple suggestion broke the ice on the \"Snow Queen\"'s decades-long story problems |author=Jim Hill |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022125512/http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx |archivedate=October 22, 2013 }}</ref> Later on, [[Glen Keane]], [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen, but none of them made their way.

with the power to create and control ice and snow while Anna wasn't known for being born any magic. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's abilities to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. One night,after they create a [[snowman]] named [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with her magic, which the impact knocks the latter out cold. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain [[troll]]s for help. The troll king, Pabbie, heals her but erases her memory of Elsa's magic, which only remains leaving the memories of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers as strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal but as she was struck in the head, she was lucky to have been healed while the heart would've been more difficult. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond as they grow into young adults. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck from an unknown 2-week voyage. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral...leaving Anna alone as the two sisters grieve separately.\n\nThree years later, when Elsa becomes a young adult, she is set to be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously preparing for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened for the first time since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry as well and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout all of the kingdom of Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go of her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, for accidentally pushing and pressuring her sister, determines to find her and bring her back, leaving her current fianc\u00e9 Hans currently in charge of Arendelle for until both of the sisters return.\n\nAt a trading post on her journey, Anna meets a [[mountain man]] named Kristoff, an [[ice trade|ice harvester]] who agrees to lead her to the North Mountain, where he knows that a magical phenomenon has occurred and helps her escape a pack of wolves, resulting in his sled being destroyed after falling down into a large hole and catching fire. The duo and Kristoff's [[reindeer]] [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]], are chased by wolves on the way and encounter Elsa's snowman, Olaf, who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa and later leads them to her palace. The sisters reunite, but Elsa is reluctant to help Anna by ending the eternal winter. Upset, she loses control of her powers, striking Anna in her heart, which ends up slowly weakening and soon becoming extremely cold as well along with other dangerous freezing side-effects. Desperate to get her sister to leave, Elsa creates a giant snow creature, named Marshmallow (by Olaf), and it throws Anna and her friends away from the palace. After escaping, Kristoff asks Anna what's next of their journey but Anna begins to have a panic-attack of worrying about Elsa, their kingdom, and Kristoff's ice business. The latter reassures the princess that his ice business is no longer his priority and that everything will be ok. But just when things were calming down, a shock of Anna's hair turning white (as a part of the curse Elsa accidentally put her sister on), leads Kristoff takes her back to his adoptive family of trolls. Although the trolls think the two are in love and the duo denying any romance between them, Anna and Kristoff soon come to silently to realize their own feelings for each other despite Anna still being engaged to Hans. As an unexpected wedding between them is about to start, Anna collapses and almost loses consciousness  as her frozen heart curse increases more in its power. Grand Pabbie sadly tells Anna and Kristoff that Anna's heart been accidentally frozen by her sister Elsa with her magic and (although he's quite powerful with strong magic of his own), only an act of true love can save her from freezing completely. Kristoff, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will heal her (as suggested by his troll adoptive mother), takes Anna back to the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, Hans has led a group of soldiers to the ice palace in a search for Anna. Elsa's defenses are not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious when Hans strikes a bow-and-arrow from one of Weselton's guards toward the palace's icy chandelier. At the castle, Anna's request for a kiss is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to freeze to death and die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the new ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna in helping her learn what love is as she confessed that she deep down didn't know much about unlike before with her argument with Elsa from the coronation incident. As he comforts her, Olaf also reveals to her Kristoff's love for her. Realizing her mutual true love feelings for the latter, Anna, (with Olaf's help), races against time to reunite with him in order to break her curse. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, but her fears triggers a massive whiteout blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she \"killed\" Anna and the blizzard comes to a screeching halt. While the end of the storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans ready to kill Elsa, and with her final breath and strength, as her curse begins to reach its end, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid...as her curse completes.\n\nAs Elsa grieves for her sister (as well as the only family she had left), Anna begins to thaw, since her choice to sacrifice herself to save her elder sister rather than herself constitutes \"an act of true love\". Upon learning that Anna saved her because of her love for her older sister, Elsa discovers that love is the key to controlling her powers and is able to thaw the kingdom as she uses her magic safely in public. Anna confronts Hans, who thought Elsa froze her heart. But Anna mocks him and says that ''he'' is the only one with the frozen heart (not her), and punches him in the face, making him fall off the ship into the water. She then buys Kristoff a previously-promised new sled and they share a kiss, starting their new relationship. Anna and Elsa's sisterly bond is then rekindled, with Elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again, much to Anna's joy.\n\n===''Frozen Fever''===\n{{main|Frozen Fever}}\n\nNearly a year after the events of the first movie, Elsa throws a birthday party for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister to make up for all the previous ones in the past, Elsa's sneezes begin to create tiny snowmen (the snowgies), which try to take the cake for themselves, and Elsa nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition, only to be rescued by her sister. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup and tells her that taking care of her older sister is the \u201cbest birthday present\u201d she ever received that day. Meanwhile, after the party, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains to live with Marshmallow.\n\n===''Olaf's Frozen Adventure''===\n{{main|Olaf's Frozen Adventure}}\n\nIn ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure'', it is the first holiday season after the castle gates have reopened. To commemorate the occasion and \"ring in the season\", Anna and Elsa plan a surprise Christmas party for Arendelle's people, though the two sisters soon come to realize that their own family lacks traditions as a result of their lengthy isolation which makes Anna really upset. Olaf, meanwhile, makes it his mission to find a holiday tradition for the sisters to share. While Olaf's efforts are unsuccessful, the sisters later go through some of their old childhood possessions and realize that they did have a holiday tradition after all. Every year for Christmas, Anna would make some artwork of Olaf and slip it under Elsa's door that helped keep them connected while they were separate and Elsa would then keep it all in a box.<ref>{{cite news |last=Booth|first=Kaitlyn|title=Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure Trailer For The 21-Minute Featurette In Front Of Coco|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-trailer-featurette-front-coco/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|accessdate=December 3, 2017|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> with Disney\u00b7[[Pixar]]'s ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' on November 22, 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Snetiker |first=Marc |title=John Lasseter talks Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure, debuts first look |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 13, 2017 |date=June 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613201807/http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |archivedate=June 13, 2017 }}</ref> It made its television debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 14, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE Makes Broadcast Television Debut on ABC, 12/14|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/OLAFS-FROZEN-ADVENTURE-Makes-Broadcast-Television-Debut-on-ABC-1214-20171208|website=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017|date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Ralph Breaks the Internet''===\n{{main|Ralph Breaks the Internet}}\nAnna and Elsa together, alongside the [[Disney Princess]]es and [[Moana (2016 film)#Cast|Moana]], appear in the film, as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/wreck-it-ralph-sequel-star-wars-disney-princesses/|title=Wreck-It Ralph sequel will unite the Disney princesses \u2014 and Star Wars!|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Frozen II''===\n{{main|Frozen II}}\n\nIn the flashback sequence, some time before the first film takes place, a young Anna and Elsa listens to a bedtime story from their father, King Agnarr. Agnarr tells them their grandfather, King Runeard, established a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest thirty-four years ago. At the ceremony, a fight breaks out, resulting in Runeard's death as he falls off a cliff along with the Northuldran warrior whom he was trying to strike down. The battle enrages the elemental spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of the forest and the spirits disappear then a wall of mist descends on the Enchanted Forest, trapping everyone inside. Agnarr, though, manages to escape with the help of an unknown savior, who saves him from the war and the two return to Arendelle as the next King and Queen.\n\nThree years after the events of ''Frozen'', Anna celebrates the arrival of autumn in the kingdom with Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven. One night, when everyone has fallen asleep, Elsa hears and follows a mysterious voice calling out to her, and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits. The spirits disrupts Arendelle, forcing everyone including Anna to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls arrive; Pabbie tells Anna and Elsa the spirits are angry over a past event, and they must discover the truth and set things right.\n\nAnna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven later travel to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice that's calling Elsa. The Wind spirit (named Gale by Olaf), appears and sweeps everyone up in a vortex, where in which it causes Anna to clutch her stomach from feeling extremely sick and nauseous. To avoid throwing up, she tries covering her hands to her mouth but it only worsens her nausea. Although Olaf offered to hold her hair back while she was nearly on the verge of really puking, he couldn't since his arms were in the back of his head (without his knowledge). Besides getting sick, Anna also almost harmed severely by a damaged tree, until it's stopped by Elsa's powers, which then formed a number of ice sculptures. Anna and Elsa discover the sculptures to be images from their father's past, and that their mother Iduna was a Northuldran who saved their father's life all those years ago. The party soon encounters the Northuldra tribe and a group of Arendellian soldiers, still in conflict with one another. The Fire spirit appears where Anna almost gets killed from inhaling in too much smoke while trying to keep her sister safe as well as trying to be careful; only to be saved by Elsa and Kristoff. Elsa soon discovers the Fire spirit to be an agitated magical salamander and manages to calms it down with her powers and soothing it. When Elsa confronts Anna about following her and nearly getting killed in the fire, Anna tearfully admits that she only went in there because she thought Elsa wasn't being careful and didn't want to lose her. The latter then apologizes to her, putting on their mother's cloak for comfort which shocks the Northuldras and Arendellians. Anna and Elsa explains their parentage to the Northuldra and the Arendellian soldiers, forming a truce between them. Later, they learn of the existence of a fifth spirit that will unite the people with the magic of nature.\n\nAnna and Elsa continue to head north with Olaf. They discover their parents' shipwreck and a map to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain memories of the past. Feeling guilty of her and Anna's parents' deaths, Elsa decides to travel alone and sends Anna and Olaf away, which deeply hurts Anna. Elsa reaches Ahtohallan, along the way taming [[Neck (water spirit)|Nokk]], the Water spirit that guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discover the voice to be her mother's call, that her powers was a gift from the magic of nature for Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr, and that she is the fifth spirit. Continuing deeper into Ahtohallan, Elsa discovers the dam to be a ruse to reduce the Northuldran' resources, as Runeard disliked the tribe's connection to magic, and that Runeard also initiated the conflict by killing the Northuldran leader. Elsa sends the information to Anna before she becomes frozen due to venturing too deep into Ahtohallan (in an similar way Anna did when was under frozen heart curse in the previous film), which causes Olaf to fade away due to the loss of Elsa's magic and it not being present.\n\nThough heart-broken of the presumed loss of her sister and best friend, Anna receives Elsa's message, as she concludes the dam must be destroyed to right the past. With help from Kristoff, Sven, and the Arendellian soldiers, she lures the giant Earth spirits to the dam, who then destroy the dam with boulders with Anna barely managing to escape the damage with Kristoff and Lieutenant Mattias\u2019 rescue. Elsa thaws out from Anna's actions of destroying the bridge and rides Nokk back to Arendelle, stopping the flood of water released by the dam from destroying the kingdom. As the mist dissipates from the Enchanted Forest, Anna apologizes to Kristoff for leaving him behind but he comforts her and tells her that it's ok and that his love for her \u201cisn't fragile\u201d. One of the spirits then reveals to Anna that Elsa is alive and well as they reunite and reconcile with one another. Elsa and Anna then revive Olaf, as he mentioned before that \"water has memory\" and Kristoff finally works up the courage to propose to Anna, which she ecstatically accepts. Elsa also explains to Anna that they are now the bridge between the people and the spirits as she puts it: the bridge has two sides just like their mother gave birth to both of them. Sometime later, Elsa abdicates the throne, making Anna the new Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, and promises regularly visits Arendelle to spend time with the ones she loves...including her younger sister Anna as peace is restored in all the lands and realms.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n====Merchandise====\n[[File:Frozen at Fantasy Faire -

({{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0|n|n|\u0251\u02d0}}) is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] who appears in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' 53rd animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' and its sequel ''[[Frozen II]]''. She is voiced by [[Kristen Bell]] as an adult. At the beginning of the film, Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provide her speaking and singing voice as a young child, respectively. Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing). In ''Frozen II'', Hadley Gannaway provided her voice as a young child while Stubenrauch is the archive audio.\n\nCreated by co-directors [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]] and [[Chris Buck]], Anna is loosely based on Gerda, a character from the Danish fairytale \"[[The Snow Queen]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. In the Disney film adaptation, Anna is depicted as the princess of Arendelle, a fictional [[Scandinavia]]n kingdom, and the younger sister of [[Elsa (Frozen)|Princess Elsa]] ([[Idina Menzel]]), who is the heiress to the throne and possesses the elemental ability to create and control ice and snow. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom after inadvertently sending Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation, fearless and faithful Anna is determined to set out on a dangerous adventure to bring her sister back and save both her kingdom and her family.\n\nThe original fairytale in general and the character of the Snow Queen in particular posed long-term problems to adapt into a feature-length production. Several film executives, including [[Walt Disney]], made their attempts towards the story and numerous adaptations were shelved as the filmmakers could not work out the characters. Finally, directors Buck and Lee solved the issue by portraying Anna and Elsa as sisters, establishing a dynamic relationship between the characters.\n\nFilm critics praised Anna's determination and enthusiasm in her personality and Bell for her performance in the films.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins and conception===\n[[File:Page 94 of Andersen's fairy tales (Robinson).png|thumbnail|left|250px|An illustration of Gerda, the character Anna is based upon.]]\nAttempts to produce an adaption of \"[[The Snow Queen]]\" in the Disney studio dated back to 1943, when [[Walt Disney]] considered collaborating with [[Samuel Goldwyn]] to produce a biography film of Hans Christian Andersen. However, the story and particularly the Snow Queen [[Character (arts)|character]] proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators. Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main [[protagonist]], Gerda (who later served as an inspiration for Anna), and the Snow Queen. Most obviously, Andersen's version did not feature any confrontation between them: when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay, the Snow Queen is nowhere to be seen. There just was not enough character conflict to form a full-length feature.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">{{cite news|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx#.UmbFXxZPrTQ |title=Countdown to Disney \"Frozen\" : How one simple suggestion broke the ice on the \"Snow Queen\"'s decades-long story problems |author=Jim Hill |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022125512/http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx |archivedate=October 22, 2013 }}</ref> Later on, [[Glen Keane]], [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen, but none of them made their way. Around 2008, [[Chris Buck]] pitched Disney his version of The Snow Queen. At the time, the project was planned to be traditionally animated under the name of ''Anna and the Snow Queen''. However, by early 2010, the project encountered the same problem and was stuck again.<ref name=ColliderGadTalks>{{cite news|last=Weintraub |first=Steve |title=Josh Gad Talks FROZEN, His History with the Project, the Songs, the Status of TRIPLETS, Playing Sam Kinison, and More |url=http://collider.com/josh-gad-frozen-triplets-sam-kinison-interview/ |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |newspaper=Collider.com |date=November 25, 2013 |time=0:33 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129100349/http://collider.com/josh-gad-frozen-triplets-sam-kinison-interview |archivedate=November 29, 2013 }}</ref> [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], ''Frozen''{{'}}s co-director, later recalled, \"The issue with the original for us in a lot of ways is it's a very symbolic story.

As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's abilities to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. One night,after they create a [[snowman]] named [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with her magic, which the impact knocks the latter out cold. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain [[troll]]s for help. The troll king, Pabbie, heals her but erases her memory of Elsa's magic, which only remains leaving the memories of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers as strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal but as she was struck in the head, she was lucky to have been healed while the heart would've been more difficult. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond as they grow into young adults. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck from an unknown 2-week voyage. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral...leaving Anna alone as the two sisters grieve separately.\n\nThree years later, when Elsa becomes a young adult, she is set to be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously preparing for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened for the first time since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry as well and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout all of the kingdom of Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go of her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, for accidentally pushing and pressuring her sister, determines to find her and bring her back, leaving her current fianc\u00e9 Hans currently in charge of Arendelle for until both of the sisters return.\n\nAt a trading post on her journey, Anna meets a [[mountain man]] named Kristoff, an [[ice trade|ice harvester]] who agrees to lead her to the North Mountain, where he knows that a magical phenomenon has occurred and helps her escape a pack of wolves, resulting in his sled being destroyed after falling down into a large hole and catching fire. The duo and Kristoff's [[reindeer]] [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]], are chased by wolves on the way and encounter Elsa's snowman, Olaf, who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa and later leads them to her palace. The sisters reunite, but Elsa is reluctant to help Anna by ending the eternal winter. Upset, she loses control of her powers, striking Anna in her heart, which ends up slowly weakening and soon becoming extremely cold as well along with other dangerous freezing side-effects. Desperate to get her sister to leave, Elsa creates a giant snow creature, named Marshmallow (by Olaf), and it throws Anna and her friends away from the palace. After escaping, Kristoff asks Anna what's next of their journey but Anna begins to have a panic-attack of worrying about Elsa, their kingdom, and Kristoff's ice business. The latter reassures the princess that his ice business is no longer his priority and that everything will be ok. But just when things were calming down, a shock of Anna's hair turning white (as a part of the curse Elsa accidentally put her sister on), leads Kristoff takes her back to his adoptive family of trolls. Although the trolls think the two are in love and the duo denying any romance between them, Anna and Kristoff soon come to silently to realize their own feelings for each other despite Anna still being engaged to Hans. As an unexpected wedding between them is about to start, Anna collapses and almost loses consciousness  as her frozen heart curse increases more in its power. Grand Pabbie sadly tells Anna and Kristoff that Anna's heart been accidentally frozen by her sister Elsa with her magic and (although he's quite powerful with strong magic of his own), only an act of true love can save her from freezing completely. Kristoff, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will heal her (as suggested by his troll adoptive mother), takes Anna back to the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, Hans has led a group of soldiers to the ice palace in a search for Anna. Elsa's defenses are not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious when Hans strikes a bow-and-arrow from one of Weselton's guards toward the palace's icy chandelier. At the castle, Anna's request for a kiss is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to freeze to death and die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the new ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna in helping her learn what love is as she confessed that she deep down didn't know much about unlike before with her argument with Elsa from the coronation incident. As he comforts her, Olaf also reveals to her Kristoff's love for her. Realizing her mutual true love feelings for the latter, Anna, (with Olaf's help), races against time to reunite with him in order to break her curse. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, but her fears triggers a massive whiteout blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she \"killed\" Anna and the blizzard comes to a screeching halt. While the end of the storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans ready to kill Elsa, and with her final breath and strength, as her curse begins to reach its end, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid...as her curse completes.\n\nAs Elsa grieves for her sister (as well as the only family she had left), Anna begins to thaw, since her choice to sacrifice herself to save her elder sister rather than herself constitutes \"an act of true love\". Upon learning that Anna saved her because of her love for her older sister, Elsa discovers that love is the key to controlling her powers and is able to thaw the kingdom as she uses her magic safely in public. Anna confronts Hans, who thought Elsa froze her heart. But Anna mocks him and says that ''he'' is the only one with the frozen heart (not her), and punches him in the face, making him fall off the ship into the water. She then buys Kristoff a previously-promised new sled and they share a kiss, starting their new relationship. Anna and Elsa's sisterly bond is then rekindled, with Elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again, much to Anna's joy.\n\n===''Frozen Fever''===\n{{main|Frozen Fever}}\n\nNearly a year after the events of the first movie, Elsa throws a birthday party for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister to make up for all the previous ones in the past, Elsa's sneezes begin to create tiny snowmen (the snowgies), which try to take the cake for themselves, and Elsa nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition, only to be rescued by her sister. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup and tells her that taking care of her older sister is the \u201cbest birthday present\u201d she ever received that day. Meanwhile, after the party, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains to live with Marshmallow.\n\n===''Olaf's Frozen Adventure''===\n{{main|Olaf's Frozen Adventure}}\n\nIn ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure'', it is the first holiday season after the castle gates have reopened. To commemorate the occasion and \"ring in the season\", Anna and Elsa plan a surprise Christmas party for Arendelle's people, though the two sisters soon come to realize that their own family lacks traditions as a result of their lengthy isolation which makes Anna really upset. Olaf, meanwhile, makes it his mission to find a holiday tradition for the sisters to share. While Olaf's efforts are unsuccessful, the sisters later go through some of their old childhood possessions and realize that they did have a holiday tradition after all. Every year for Christmas, Anna would make some artwork of Olaf and slip it under Elsa's door that helped keep them connected while they were separate and Elsa would then keep it all in a box.<ref>{{cite news |last=Booth|first=Kaitlyn|title=Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure Trailer For The 21-Minute Featurette In Front Of Coco|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-trailer-featurette-front-coco/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|accessdate=December 3, 2017|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> with Disney\u00b7[[Pixar]]'s ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' on November 22, 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Snetiker |first=Marc |title=John Lasseter talks Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure, debuts first look |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 13, 2017 |date=June 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613201807/http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |archivedate=June 13, 2017 }}</ref> It made its television debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 14, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE Makes Broadcast Television Debut on ABC, 12/14|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/OLAFS-FROZEN-ADVENTURE-Makes-Broadcast-Television-Debut-on-ABC-1214-20171208|website=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017|date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Ralph Breaks the Internet''===\n{{main|Ralph Breaks the Internet}}\nAnna and Elsa together, alongside the [[Disney Princess]]es and [[Moana (2016 film)#Cast|Moana]], appear in the film, as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/wreck-it-ralph-sequel-star-wars-disney-princesses/|title=Wreck-It Ralph sequel will unite the Disney princesses \u2014 and Star Wars!|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Frozen II''===\n{{main|Frozen II}}\n\nIn the flashback sequence, some time before the first film takes place, a young Anna and Elsa listens to a bedtime story from their father, King Agnarr. Agnarr tells them their grandfather, King Runeard, established a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest thirty-four years ago. At the ceremony, a fight breaks out, resulting in Runeard's death as he falls off a cliff along with the Northuldran warrior whom he was trying to strike down. The battle enrages the elemental spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of the forest and the spirits disappear then a wall of mist descends on the Enchanted Forest, trapping everyone inside. Agnarr, though, manages to escape with the help of an unknown savior, who saves him from the war and the two return to Arendelle as the next King and Queen.\n\nThree years after the events of ''Frozen'', Anna celebrates the arrival of autumn in the kingdom with Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven. One night, when everyone has fallen asleep, Elsa hears and follows a mysterious voice calling out to her, and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits. The spirits disrupts Arendelle, forcing everyone including Anna to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls arrive; Pabbie tells Anna and Elsa the spirits are angry over a past event, and they must discover the truth and set things right.\n\nAnna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven later travel to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice that's calling Elsa. The Wind spirit (named Gale by Olaf), appears and sweeps everyone up in a vortex, where in which it causes Anna to clutch her stomach from feeling extremely sick and nauseous. To avoid throwing up, she tries covering her hands to her mouth but it only worsens her nausea. Although Olaf offered to hold her hair back while she was nearly on the verge of really puking, he couldn't since his arms were in the back of his head (without his knowledge). Besides getting sick, Anna also almost harmed severely by a damaged tree, until it's stopped by Elsa's powers, which then formed a number of ice sculptures. Anna and Elsa discover the sculptures to be images from their father's past, and that their mother Iduna was a Northuldran who saved their father's life all those years ago. The party soon encounters the Northuldra tribe and a group of Arendellian soldiers, still in conflict with one another. The Fire spirit appears where Anna almost gets killed from inhaling in too much smoke while trying to keep her sister safe as well as trying to be careful; only to be saved by Elsa and Kristoff. Elsa soon discovers the Fire spirit to be an agitated magical salamander and manages to calms it down with her powers and soothing it. When Elsa confronts Anna about following her and nearly getting killed in the fire, Anna tearfully admits that she only went in there because she thought Elsa wasn't being careful and didn't want to lose her. The latter then apologizes to her, putting on their mother's cloak for comfort which shocks the Northuldras and Arendellians. Anna and Elsa explains their parentage to the Northuldra and the Arendellian soldiers, forming a truce between them. Later, they learn of the existence of a fifth spirit that will unite the people with the magic of nature.\n\nAnna and Elsa continue to head north with Olaf. They discover their parents' shipwreck and a map to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain memories of the past. Feeling guilty of her and Anna's parents' deaths, Elsa decides to travel alone and sends Anna and Olaf away, which deeply hurts Anna. Elsa reaches Ahtohallan, along the way taming [[Neck (water spirit)|Nokk]], the Water spirit that guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discover the voice to be her mother's call, that her powers was a gift from the magic of nature for Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr, and that she is the fifth spirit. Continuing deeper into Ahtohallan, Elsa discovers the dam to be a ruse to reduce the Northuldran' resources, as Runeard disliked the tribe's connection to magic, and that Runeard also initiated the conflict by killing the Northuldran leader. Elsa sends the information to Anna before she becomes frozen due to venturing too deep into Ahtohallan (in an similar way Anna did when was under frozen heart curse in the previous film), which causes Olaf to fade away due to the loss of Elsa's magic and it not being present.\n\nThough heart-broken of the presumed loss of her sister and best friend, Anna receives Elsa's message, as she concludes the dam must be destroyed to right the past. With help from Kristoff, Sven, and the Arendellian soldiers, she lures the giant Earth spirits to the dam, who then destroy the dam with boulders with Anna barely managing to escape the damage with Kristoff and Lieutenant Mattias\u2019 rescue. Elsa thaws out from Anna's actions of destroying the bridge and rides Nokk back to Arendelle, stopping the flood of water released by the dam from destroying the kingdom. As the mist dissipates from the Enchanted Forest, Anna apologizes to Kristoff for leaving him behind but he comforts her and tells her that it's ok and that his love for her \u201cisn't fragile\u201d. One of the spirits then reveals to Anna that Elsa is alive and well as they reunite and reconcile with one another. Elsa and Anna then revive Olaf, as he mentioned before that \"water has memory\" and Kristoff finally works up the courage to propose to Anna, which she ecstatically accepts. Elsa also explains to Anna that they are now the bridge between the people and the spirits as she puts it: the bridge has two sides just like their mother gave birth to both of them. Sometime later, Elsa abdicates the throne, making Anna the new Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, and promises regularly visits Arendelle to spend time with the ones she loves...including her younger sister Anna as peace is restored in all the lands and realms.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n====Merchandise====\n[[File:Frozen at Fantasy Faire -
