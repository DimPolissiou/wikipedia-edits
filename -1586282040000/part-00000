Despite a rough 1\u20139 inaugural campaign, Donnelly quickly got the team turned around. From 2000\u20132004, the Mules won five straight [[Centennial Conference]] championships,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.prestosports.com/sports/fball/2010-11/files/64-85-History.pdf|title=Centennial Conference|author=|date=|website=Centennial Conference}}</ref> and thus, earned five straight postseason berths. In 2007, the Mules again won the Centennial Conference, and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly took his team back to the playoffs by winning the Centennial Conference again in 2008, where they fell in the first round, and again in 2010, with the same result.\n\nSince the 2000 season, Muhlenberg has compiled a 66\u201328 overall record in the Centennial Conference, second best among all active and former members behind only [[Johns Hopkins University]].

In 2007, the Mules again won the Centennial Conference, and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly took his team back to the playoffs by winning the Centennial Conference again in 2008, where they fell in the first round, and again in 2010, with the same result.\n\nSince the 2000 season, Muhlenberg has compiled a 66\u201328 overall record in the Centennial Conference, second best among all active and former members behind only [[Johns Hopkins University]].

There are some unique challenges faced by students wishing to pursue advanced training in [[Nunavut]], a vast territory stretching across Arctic Canada from Hudsons Bay to the north pole. The territory was split from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1999, following a successful plebiscite which affirmed Inuit desires to establish an independent political jurisdiction. Covering one-fifth of Canada's area and over 60% of its coastlines, the territory had a population of 31,153 in 2010.\n\nThere are no universities in Nunavut. [[Nunavut Arctic College]] is the only institution of higher education. It offers a small number of degrees in conjunction with [[Dalhousie University]] \u2013 Nunavut Nursing Program, [[University of Regina]] \u2013 Nunavut Teacher Education, [[University of Prince Edward Island]] \u2013 Master of Education in Leadership and Learning program, and the former [[Akitsiraq Law School|Akitsiraq Law Program]]. Northerners can also receive training in both very basic academic and [[Vocational education|vocational]] studies. Due to the distance and lack of connecting roads between communities, the college attempts to operate on the basis that [[adult education]] must be delivered in all communities and that the training be tailored to address individual and community needs.<ref name=NAC6>{{cite web |url=http://nac.nu.ca/files/Academic%20Calendar%202005-07%20ENG.pdf |title=A Brief Overview of Nunavut Arctic College (pg. 6) |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Nunavut Arctic College: Calendar of Courses |publisher=Nunavut Arctic College |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422114019/http://nac.nu.ca/files/Academic%20Calendar%202005-07%20ENG.pdf |archive-date=2007-04-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>   \n    \nNunavut and the Canadian North have begun to think about and address the issues of language and quality of education in K to 12 through the creative and demanding Education Act (Nunavut 2008) which strongly supports Inuit languages and culture in the school system. The implementation of this fundamental legislation is propelling an intensive effort to strengthen and improve the quality of primary and secondary education, but also has compelled a closer look at Teacher Education in the College, and the quality and ability of graduates to teach effectively at all levels. The first two terms of the Nunavut government invested very strongly in new schools in Nunavut Communities leading (among other factors) to a steadily increasing number of high school graduates, bringing additional pressures to the College through additional adult learners. The College has struggled to effectively meet this expanding demand for higher quality, diversity, and expanded delivery.   \n\nThe external dialogue has also accelerated recently with former Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean speaking in favour of an Arctic University [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/642053 GG advocates for Arctic learning],    \n-Attempts to build an \"Arctic University\", an alliance of 30 institutions with circumpolar components, located mostly in existing institutions with Arctic research mandates, and    \n- ~ The declaration of the three territorial Premiers (Yukon \u2013 Fentie, NWT \u2013 Roland, Nunavut \u2013 Aariak) who, in a September 2009 [http://www.gov.nu.ca/news/2009/sept/sept5a.pdf Conference Communique] \"committed to examine options for the development of a northern university\" in common.    \n    \n[[The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation]] has taken up the issue of post-secondary education in the Canadian North, both through its [https://archive.is/20100907062633/http://www.gordonfn.org/CdnNorth_ArcticVoicesFellowship.cfm Arctic Voices Fellowship] program and through its commitment to sponsor a 2010 conference among territorial interest groups to address a common institutional design which would enhance post-secondary learning across Canada's northern territories.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Iqaluit-aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the community of Iqaluit]]\nAlthough the territory of Nunavut was created in 1999, Nunavut Arctic College (NAC) was created in 1995 through legislation implemented January 1, 1995, when the former Arctic College was split into [[Aurora College]] in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Arctic College in the eastern arctic.<ref name=NAC6/> Today this early split is seen as an attempt by the dominant western college to retain resources and funding after division and has been seen at the heart of the multi-year struggle of the College to fulfill its mandate, address public perception, despite a number of successful and effective graduates, that instruction and student quality are low and that many students drop out or become perpetual enrollees in an atmosphere where instructors take advantage of weak management and collective bargaining status as \"teachers\" with school year type holidays and no obligations for research and long term scholarship. \n\nThe major [[campus]]es of Nunavut Arctic College are Nunatta Campus in [[Iqaluit]] on [[Baffin Island]], Kivalliq Campus at [[Rankin Inlet]], and Kitikmeot Campus at [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]]. The three campuses have very distinct atmospheres and approaches, some being vital and active with committed leadership and others being regrettably perfunctory in performing their obligations. The College has also established Learning Centres in twenty-four of the twenty-six communities on the territory.<ref name=WHED>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/systems_data/ca13.rtf |title=Canada (Nunavut) \u2013 Education system |accessdate=2008-07-25 |format=RTF |publisher=IAU, World Higher Education Database (WHED) }}</ref><ref name=NAC6/> The efficiency and quality of these Centres varies with the enthusiasm and basic abilities of the single supervising instructor, and the College struggles to maintain these feeder institutions with minimal financial support and varying program success. Prior to 1999 most campus infrastructure had been built in the western territory, and Nunavut Arctic College is still running to catch up with the need for classrooms and residences to serve an exploding youth population in Nunavut.\n\n==Governance==\nHigher education in Nunavut is the responsibility of the territorial government, consistent with jurisdictions across Canada.

There are some unique challenges faced by students wishing to pursue advanced training in [[Nunavut]], a vast territory stretching across Arctic Canada from Hudsons Bay to the north pole. The territory was split from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1999, following a successful plebiscite which affirmed Inuit desires to establish an independent political jurisdiction. Covering one-fifth of Canada\u2019s area and over 60% of its coastlines, the territory had a population of 31,153 in 2010.\n\nThere are no universities in Nunavut. [[Nunavut Arctic College]] is the only institution of higher education. It offers a small number of degrees in conjunction with [[Dalhousie University]] \u2013 Nunavut Nursing Program, [[University of Regina]] \u2013 Nunavut Teacher Education, [[University of Prince Edward Island]] \u2013 Master of Education in Leadership and Learning program, and the former [[Akitsiraq Law School|Akitsiraq Law Program]]. Northerners can also receive training in both very basic academic and [[Vocational education|vocational]] studies. Due to the distance and lack of connecting roads between communities, the college attempts to operate on the basis that [[adult education]] must be delivered in all communities and that the training be tailored to address individual and community needs.<ref name=NAC6>{{cite web |url=http://nac.nu.ca/files/Academic%20Calendar%202005-07%20ENG.pdf |title=A Brief Overview of Nunavut Arctic College (pg. 6) |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Nunavut Arctic College: Calendar of Courses |publisher=Nunavut Arctic College |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422114019/http://nac.nu.ca/files/Academic%20Calendar%202005-07%20ENG.pdf |archive-date=2007-04-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>   \n    \nNunavut and the Canadian North have begun to think about and address the issues of language and quality of education in K to 12 through the creative and demanding Education Act (Nunavut 2008) which strongly supports Inuit languages and culture in the school system. The implementation of this fundamental legislation is propelling an intensive effort to strengthen and improve the quality of primary and secondary education, but also has compelled a closer look at Teacher Education in the College, and the quality and ability of graduates to teach effectively at all levels. The first two terms of the Nunavut government invested very strongly in new schools in Nunavut Communities leading (among other factors) to a steadily increasing number of high school graduates, bringing additional pressures to the College through additional adult learners. The College has struggled to effectively meet this expanding demand for higher quality, diversity, and expanded delivery.   \n\nThe external dialogue has also accelerated recently with former Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean speaking in favour of an Arctic University [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/642053 GG advocates for Arctic learning],    \n-Attempts to build an \"Arctic University\", an alliance of 30 institutions with circumpolar components, located mostly in existing institutions with Arctic research mandates, and    \n- ~ The declaration of the three territorial Premiers (Yukon \u2013 Fentie, NWT \u2013 Roland, Nunavut \u2013 Aariak) who, in a September 2009 [http://www.gov.nu.ca/news/2009/sept/sept5a.pdf Conference Communique] \"committed to examine options for the development of a northern university\" in common.    \n    \n[[The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation]] has taken up the issue of post-secondary education in the Canadian North, both through its [https://archive.is/20100907062633/http://www.gordonfn.org/CdnNorth_ArcticVoicesFellowship.cfm Arctic Voices Fellowship] program and through its commitment to sponsor a 2010 conference among territorial interest groups to address a common institutional design which would enhance post-secondary learning across Canada's northern territories.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Iqaluit-aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the community of Iqaluit]]\nAlthough the territory of Nunavut was created in 1999, Nunavut Arctic College (NAC) was created in 1995 through legislation implemented January 1, 1995, when the former Arctic College was split into [[Aurora College]] in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Arctic College in the eastern arctic.<ref name=NAC6/> Today this early split is seen as an attempt by the dominant western college to retain resources and funding after division and has been seen at the heart of the multi-year struggle of the College to fulfill its mandate, address public perception, despite a number of successful and effective graduates, that instruction and student quality are low and that many students drop out or become perpetual enrollees in an atmosphere where instructors take advantage of weak management and collective bargaining status as \"teachers\" with school year type holidays and no obligations for research and long term scholarship. \n\nThe major [[campus]]es of Nunavut Arctic College are Nunatta Campus in [[Iqaluit]] on [[Baffin Island]], Kivalliq Campus at [[Rankin Inlet]], and Kitikmeot Campus at [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]]. The three campuses have very distinct atmospheres and approaches, some being vital and active with committed leadership and others being regrettably perfunctory in performing their obligations. The College has also established Learning Centres in twenty-four of the twenty-six communities on the territory.<ref name=WHED>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/systems_data/ca13.rtf |title=Canada (Nunavut) \u2013 Education system |accessdate=2008-07-25 |format=RTF |publisher=IAU, World Higher Education Database (WHED) }}</ref><ref name=NAC6/> The efficiency and quality of these Centres varies with the enthusiasm and basic abilities of the single supervising instructor, and the College struggles to maintain these feeder institutions with minimal financial support and varying program success. Prior to 1999 most campus infrastructure had been built in the western territory, and Nunavut Arctic College is still running to catch up with the need for classrooms and residences to serve an exploding youth population in Nunavut.\n\n==Governance==\nHigher education in Nunavut is the responsibility of the territorial government, consistent with jurisdictions across Canada.

They were looking for a bass player, so he bought his first bass and started jamming with covers of the [[Sex Pistols]], the [[Ramones]], and the like. They covered songs from the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, [[Sid Vicious]], [[XTC]], [[The Stranglers]], and others. Some time later, he decided to leave in hope of finding a heavier band with more live playing opportunities, then he met [[Kai Hansen]] and his band Second Hell, with whom he started playing. The band soon joined forces with former Powerfool guitarist [[Michael Weikath]] and adopted the name [[Helloween]], with the original lineup being [[Kai Hansen]] (guitars/vocals), Michael Weikath (guitars), Grosskopf (bass) and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] (drums).\n\n{{Main|Helloween}}\nGrosskopf writes some of the band's songs, which were initially mostly used as [[B-sides]], but since ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (which contained 3 songs credited to Markus), tracks written by him are regularly present on their albums.\n\nIn 2011 Grosskopf with [[Helloween]] band performed in Greece.

Markus Grosskopf's family members currently live in South Africa, Canada, the United States, and Germany.\n\n==Biography==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}\nGrosskopf started playing bass at the age of 15 when he became friends with a drummer and a guitar player. They were looking for a bass player, so he bought his first bass and started jamming with covers of the [[Sex Pistols]], the [[Ramones]], and the like. They covered songs from the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, [[Sid Vicious]], [[XTC]], [[The Stranglers]], and others. Some time later, he decided to leave in hope of finding a heavier band with more live playing opportunities, then he met [[Kai Hansen]] and his band Second Hell, with whom he started playing. The band soon joined forces with former Powerfool guitarist [[Michael Weikath]] and adopted the name [[Helloween]], with the original lineup being [[Kai Hansen]] (guitars/vocals), Michael Weikath (guitars), Grosskopf (bass) and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] (drums).\n\n{{Main|Helloween}}\nGrosskopf writes some of the band's songs, which were initially mostly used as [[B-sides]], but since ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (which contained 3 songs credited to Markus), tracks written by him are regularly present on their albums.\n\nIn 2011 Grosskopf with [[Helloween]] band performed in Greece. During that time, he along with [[Andi Deris]] and [[Uli Kusch]] had recorded ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bravewords.com/news/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf-if-you-are-scared-to-do-something-you-shouldnt-be-working-in-this-business-video-interview-available|title=Helloween Bassist Markus Grosskopf - \"If You Are Scared To Do Something You Shouldn't Be Working In This Business\"; Video Interview Available|work=Brave Words|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 he and his fellow band mates [[Kai Hansen]], [[Michael Kiske]], [[Sascha Gerstner]], [[Andi Deris]], [[Michael Weikath]] and [[Dani L\u00f6ble]] had participated in the 'Pumpkins United' Reunion Tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/markus-grosskopf-on-helloweens-pumpkins-united-reunion-tour-its-getting-better-and-better-every-day/|title=MARKUS GROSSKOPF On HELLOWEEN's 'Pumpkins United' Reunion Tour: 'It's Getting Better And Better Every Day'|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=11 November 2017|accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Helloween (album)|Helloween]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 2]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Master of the Rings]]'' (1994)\n*''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' (1996)\n*''[[Better Than Raw]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Metal Jukebox]]'' (1999)\n*''[[The Dark Ride]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Unarmed \u2013 Best of 25th Anniversary]]'' (2009)\n*''[[7 Sinners]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Straight Out of Hell]]'' (2013)\n*''[[My God-Given Right]]'' (2015)\n\n==Side projects==\nGrosskopf's first side project was Shockmachine where he played both bass and rhythm guitars.

An Intel Joule is used for the computationally-intensive vision-based navigation algorithms.  Seeker's propulsion system is controlled by a custom, FPGA-based board and power is provided to the system from GomSpace NanoPower BP4 batteries.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n==Propulsion==\nThe Seeker vehicle contained a small 6 \u2013 Degree of Freedom, cold gas nitrogen based cubesat propulsion system. The propulsion system is approximately 1.25U in size and contains 12 0.1 N thrusters. The system contained a small titanium pressure vessel and was capable of providing approximately 5 m/s DV.

The AFM is a state machine that ensures the vehicle's systems are in the appropriate configuration for each phase of the mission.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Navigation===\nSeeker's navigation system consists of two core FSW applications and six applications that provide appropriately processed sensor information.  The system leverages [[Project Morpheus]] architecture and code components.  The core of the navigation system is a propagator that integrates the vehicle state at 50\u00a0Hz and a multiplicative extended kalman filter that updates the state at 5Hz.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Guidance===\nSeeker\u2019s guidance FSW application ran at 5Hz and allowed for waypoint seeking, position and attitude holds, target tracking, and limited Seeker's kinetic energy by limiting the vehicle's overall velocity.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Control===\nSeeker's control FSW application ran at 5Hz and calculated translational commands with a proportional-integral function and rotational commands with a phase plane function.  The application then combined these inputs into a single command that accounted for thruster limitations.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Sensors===\nSeeker's sensor suite consisted of a STIM-300 IMU, a DLEM-SR laser rangefinder, a camera feeding the vision-based navigation system, GPS, and nanoSSOC-D60 sun sensors.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Vision-based Navigation System===\nThe UT Austin Texas Spacecraft Laboratory developed an algorithm that processed images taken by the Seeker camera into bearing measurements by identifying the Cygnus with a convolutional neural network and then using a traditional computer vision approach to centroid it.

An Intel Joule is used for the computationally-intensive vision-based navigation algorithms.  Seeker's propulsion system is controlled by a custom, FPGA-based board and power is provided to the system from GomSpace NanoPower BP4 batteries.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n==Propulsion==\nThe Seeker vehicle contained a small 6 \u2013 Degree of Freedom, cold gas nitrogen based cubesat propulsion system. The propulsion system is approximately 1.25U in size and contains 12 0.1 N thrusters. The system contained a small titanium pressure vessel and was capable of providing approximately 5 m/s DV. [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2019-3956]\n\nIn an effort to minimize mass, optimize packing, and substantial reductions in iteration time between designs, aa significant effort was undertaken to utilize additive manufacturing (AM) technology as part of the Seeker propulsion system. The certified AM thrusters were the first known additively manufactured (AM) pressurized plastic components which are designed to meet or exceed NASA standards and are certified for pressurized ground and flight use around operators. [https://www.carbon3d.com/blog/nasa-seeker-x-tth-powered-by-carbon/]\n\n==Guidance, Navigation, and Control System==\n\n===Automated Flight Manager===\nSeeker's Automated Flight Manager (AFM) is a FSW application that allows the vehicle to function highly independently of human input.  The AFM is a state machine that ensures the vehicle's systems are in the appropriate configuration for each phase of the mission.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Navigation===\nSeeker's navigation system consists of two core FSW applications and six applications that provide appropriately processed sensor information.  The system leverages [[Project Morpheus]] architecture and code components.  The core of the navigation system is a propagator that integrates the vehicle state at 50Hz and a multiplicative extended kalman filter that updates the state at 5Hz.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Guidance===\nSeeker\u2019s guidance FSW application ran at 5Hz and allowed for waypoint seeking, position and attitude holds, target tracking, and limited Seeker's kinetic energy by limiting the vehicle's overall velocity.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Control===\nSeeker's control FSW application ran at 5Hz and calculated translational commands with a proportional-integral function and rotational commands with a phase plane function.  The application then combined these inputs into a single command that accounted for thruster limitations.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Sensors===\nSeeker's sensor suite consisted of a STIM-300 IMU, a DLEM-SR laser rangefinder, a camera feeding the vision-based navigation system, GPS, and nanoSSOC-D60 sun sensors.<ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n===Vision-based Navigation System===\nThe UT Austin Texas Spacecraft Laboratory developed an algorithm that processed images taken by the Seeker camera into bearing measurements by identifying the Cygnus with a convolutional neural network and then using a traditional computer vision approach to centroid it.  This approach was found to be more robust than purely traditional alternatives in ground testing.<ref name=Seeker_tsl>[https://sites.utexas.edu/tsl/seeker/ TSL: Seeker ], Retrieved in October 2019.</ref><ref name=Seeker_GNC_Overview/>\n\n<gallery>\nCygnus-dark.gif|Neural network bounding Cygnus against a dark background\nCygnus-earth-2.gif|Neural network bounding Cygnus with Earth in the background\n</gallery>\n\n===Mission Results===\n\nSeeker deployed from Cygnus on September 19, 2019 and gathered the below images (stitched together into a gif).\n\n[[File:Seeker deploy.gif|Imagery captured from Seeker on deploy from Cygnus.]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[AERCam Sprint]]\n* [[AERCam Sprint#Follow on|Mini AERCam]]\n* [[SPHERES]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

On November 6, 2019, the college announced a plan to close at the end of the 2019\u20132020 academic year and merge with [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]].\n\nStudents at Marlboro create an individualized course of study in collaboration with faculty members and participate in a self-governed community. Students pursue a self-designed, often inter-disciplinary thesis, the Plan of Concentration, based on their academic interests that culminates in a major body of scholarship. Students can use the college's organic farm, solar greenhouse, ecological reserve, and observatory. Weekly \"[[town meeting]]s\" are held to vote for and change the college's bylaws.\n\n==History==\nMarlboro College was founded in 1946 by Walter Hendricks on Potash Hill in Marlboro, Vermont, and many of the first students were returning [[World War II]] veterans.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.marlboro.edu/about/history/ |website=Marlboro College |publisher=Marlboro College |accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref> The school's operation was initially financed using money received from the [[GI Bill]], as well as loans from Brattleboro Savings and Loan. The campus incorporates the buildings of three old farms that once operated on the college site, along with more modern buildings. Marlboro has grown steadily since its inception, and 150 students currently attend, with an average enrollment of 250 students. The College, however, is kept \"intentionally small.\"\n\nIn 1997 Marlboro College founded the [[Marlboro College Graduate School]] to apply the same educational principles of Marlboro College to advance the careers of working professionals. The Graduate School also offers an accelerated Master's track to undergraduates in select programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5085/Marlboro%20Launches%20Accelerated%20Master\u2019s%20Track|title=Marlboro Launches Accelerated Master\u2019s Track|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref> While the Graduate School was initially located in nearby Brattleboro, it moved to the main college campus in Marlboro in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformer.com/stories/marlboro-college-consolidates-campuses,503176|title=Marlboro College consolidates campuses|date=April 2, 2017|website=Brattleboro Reformer}}</ref>\n\nThe Marlboro College campus has also been the summer home for more than 50 years to the [[Marlboro Music Festival]].\n\nIn 2018, Marlboro's small size and dwindling enrollment led it to begin exploring merging with another college or university.  Discussions advanced with the [[University of Bridgeport]] but were called off in September 2019 as negotiations continued.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/09/16/marlboro-college-and-u-bridgeport-drop-plans-merge |title=No Deal |first=Colleen |last=Flaherty |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=September 16, 2019 |accessdate=November 6, 2019}}</ref> Two months later, the college announced plans to merge with [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]].  Marlboro plans to give its endowment and real estate to Emerson where all Marlboro students will be admitted and tenure-track faculty will be able to choose to teach at Emerson.

Marlboro is just off Route 9, which runs east\u2013west across southern Vermont, ten miles from [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] to the east with [[Wilmington, Vermont|Wilmington]] and [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] further to the west. Boston is two and a half hours to the east, Burlington is two and a half hours to the north, [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]] is one and a half hours to the south, and New York City is four hours to the south.\n\nThe closest major town is Brattleboro, and students frequently make the 20-minute drive along Route 9 to hang out there at night and on weekends. The similar but much larger [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]]\u2013[[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] area of western [[Massachusetts]], easily accessible via Interstate 91, is also a favorite hangout.\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Marlboro College dining hall and Mather.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The dining hall and Mather building at Marlboro College]]\n\nMarlboro's facilities are relatively small because of its enrollment numbers. Many of the buildings\u2014including the main classroom building, the dining hall, the admissions building and the administration building\u2014are converted farm buildings that predate the college. Students and faculty worked together to convert these historic buildings for use by the college.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/about/history|title=OUR HISTORY|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref> Through grants from federal, state and private entities, the college improved the energy-efficiency of the Dining Hall, Dalrymple classroom building, Mather administration building, and the Admissions building since 2008, as well as the student residences. In the summer of 2011, the half-circle driveway at the campus entrance was converted to green space and walking paths.\n[[File:Marlboro library 112896728.jpg|left|thumb|Marlboro College Library]]\n\nThe Serkin Performing Arts Center has a 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with baby grand pianos and a 5,000-square foot dance studio. Whittemore Theater is another performing arts space which is used primarily by the Theater department. Attached to Whittemore theater is Drury Gallery, a gallery space often used by fine arts students to display their works, although students from other departments have also used the space to showcase their work.\n\nThe Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, a $3.5-million dollar, 14,000-square-foot visual arts center that houses studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces, opened in May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/4572/community-dedicates-visual-arts-center|title=Community Dedicates Visual Arts Center|date=May 2016|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nMarlboro is 1 of only 3 national liberal arts colleges in which 100% of its classes have fewer than 20 students.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5125/Marlboro%20Continues%20to%20Rise%20in%20U.S.%20News%20Ranking|title=Marlboro Continues to Rise in U.S. News Ranking|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref>\nThree quarters of Marlboro College alumni attend graduate school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/community/alumni/survey_results|title=Alumni Survey Substantiates Positive Image|last=|first=|date=2012|website=www.marlboro.edu|publisher=|access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Clear Writing Requirement===\nFreshman students usually take one or more classes designed to boost their writing skills to an acceptable undergraduate level. All freshmen must submit 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee by the end of their second semester. If the committee decides that a student's writing skills need more work, they recommend a class to help, and the student must prepare another portfolio, at least 10 pages of which must be new, at the end of the next semester for re-evaluation. In the event that a student fails the writing requirement for three consecutive semesters, the school will ask the student to leave with the caveat that they can return after receiving high marks from an English class at another school. However, virtually all students pass the writing requirement within two semesters.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=Clear Writing Program|url=https://nook.marlboro.edu/public/academics/clear_writing|website=nook.marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Plan of Concentration===\nJuniors and seniors focus on developing an individualized Plan of Concentration rather than on heavy coursework. \"Plan\" is a large, self-designed project often involving a combination of disciplines. Juniors and seniors focus on independent work and increasingly take tutorial classes where the student collaborates closely with a faculty member to design an individualized syllabus. For most students Plan culminates in a written thesis, although art and science students may demonstrate work through other projects. All Plans must include a written portion constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan work. In addition, all Plans must include an independent project prepared without direct faculty input, also constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan. Plans that consist entirely of academic writing usually range from one hundred to two hundred pages, double-spaced.\n\nThe results of this work are defended in an oral examination before two Marlboro professors, and one outside evaluator who has expertise in the student's field of study but is not connected with the college. The presence of the outside evaluator is meant to ensure that the grading process is fair and objective. The final plan is then put on permanent file as a reference work in the college library.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=PLAN OF CONCENTRATION|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/academics/undergraduate/plan-of-concentration|website=marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Academic honors===\nLoren Pope, original author of the ''Colleges that Change Lives'' college guide and former education editor for ''The New York Times'', writes about Marlboro, \"You will find the Marlboro adventure far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone. There simply is no comparison.\"<ref>Pope, Loren. ''Colleges That Change Lives'', 3rd edition, 2006, p. 10.</ref>\n\nMarlboro College received a perfect academics rating of 99 and was also ranked #1 nationally for its quality of professors (\"Professors Get High Marks\") in The Princeton Review's 2014 annual college guide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtdigger.org/2013/08/07/marlboro-college-professors-ranked-1-nationally-by-princeton-review/|title=Marlboro College professors ranked #1 nationally by Princeton Review|date=7 August 2013|website=vtdigger.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Beautiful Minds Challenge ===\nSince 2012 the college has offered the Beautiful Minds Challenge, an essay contest for high school students that rewards winners with 12 full or partial scholarships and other prizes. Essays may take the form of text, images, audio, or video. Submissions are judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students. Finalists are flown to the Marlboro campus for a Symposium where they present their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5123/Marlboro%20launches%202017%20Beautiful%20Minds%20Challenge|title=Marlboro launches 2017 Beautiful Minds Challenge|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref> The Beautiful Minds Challenge was discontinued after the 2018 competition.\n\n==People==\n===Notable faculty===\n* [[Wyn Cooper]] taught at Marlboro.\n* [[Jay Craven]] teaches film at Marlboro.\n* [[Paul LeBlanc (college president)|Paul J.

During the Spring and Fall, students are encouraged to \"plant, weed, landscape, and harvest on a regular basis\" on the school farm. Once a semester, a campuswide Work Day, in the spirit of the original class which built their own dormitories, encourages students, staff, and faculty to maintain campus through various projects that change depending on the needs of the campus. \"Midnight Breakfast\" is an event celebrated each semester the eve before writing portfolios are due.\n\nThe school was founded on and continues to encourage a tradition of community participation and values. A weekly \"[[town meeting]]\" allows all community members to gather and vote to change the college bylaws. An elected community court dispenses justice when necessary. Different elected committees, consisting of students, faculty and staff, help to hire faculty (or even college presidents) and steer the curriculum, among many other responsibilities.\n\nThe library is also open all night and uses a self-checkout honor system to keep track of borrowed materials. All buildings, academic and residential, are open 24/7 to allow students to access materials and workspaces at their discretion.\n\nAthletics are also shaped by Marlboro's location, and by Vermont's long winters &ndash; the coldest weather coincides with the academic year. Though few organized sports teams exist, the school's \"Outdoor Program\" promotes activities such as rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, hiking, and the annual February broomball tournament, a collegiate tradition maintained since 1998. In addition, the College is just 15 miles from the [[Mount Snow]] ski resort.\n\n==Student publications==\nEditors-in-chief of the College's different magazines are elected during town meetings. The administration of the school publishes a biannual magazine, ''Potash Hill''. A [[student newspaper]], ''The Citizen'', is published monthly on campus. \"Articles in The Citizen vary from serious editorials to tongue-in-cheek campus news, from oblique photo-essays to \u201cHorrorscopes\u201d like \u201cSagittarius: Money from strangers can be expected.

Attached to Whittemore theater is Drury Gallery, a gallery space often used by fine arts students to display their works, although students from other departments have also used the space to showcase their work.\n\nThe Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, a $3.5-million dollar, 14,000-square-foot visual arts center that houses studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces, opened in May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/4572/community-dedicates-visual-arts-center|title=Community Dedicates Visual Arts Center|date=May 2016|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nMarlboro is 1 of only 3 national liberal arts colleges in which 100% of its classes have fewer than 20 students.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5125/Marlboro%20Continues%20to%20Rise%20in%20U.S.%20News%20Ranking|title=Marlboro Continues to Rise in U.S. News Ranking|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref>\nThree quarters of Marlboro College alumni attend graduate school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/community/alumni/survey_results|title=Alumni Survey Substantiates Positive Image|last=|first=|date=2012|website=www.marlboro.edu|publisher=|access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Clear Writing Requirement===\nFreshman students usually take one or more classes designed to boost their writing skills to an acceptable undergraduate level. All freshmen must submit 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee by the end of their second semester. If the committee decides that a student's writing skills need more work, they recommend a class to help, and the student must prepare another portfolio, at least 10 pages of which must be new, at the end of the next semester for re-evaluation. In the event that a student fails the writing requirement for three consecutive semesters, the school will ask the student to leave with the caveat that they can return after receiving high marks from an English class at another school. However, virtually all students pass the writing requirement within two semesters.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=Clear Writing Program|url=https://nook.marlboro.edu/public/academics/clear_writing|website=nook.marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Plan of Concentration===\nJuniors and seniors focus on developing an individualized Plan of Concentration rather than on heavy coursework. \"Plan\" is a large, self-designed project often involving a combination of disciplines. Juniors and seniors focus on independent work and increasingly take tutorial classes where the student collaborates closely with a faculty member to design an individualized syllabus. For most students Plan culminates in a written thesis, although art and science students may demonstrate work through other projects. All Plans must include a written portion constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan work. In addition, all Plans must include an independent project prepared without direct faculty input, also constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan. Plans that consist entirely of academic writing usually range from one hundred to two hundred pages, double-spaced.\n\nThe results of this work are defended in an oral examination before two Marlboro professors, and one outside evaluator who has expertise in the student's field of study but is not connected with the college. The presence of the outside evaluator is meant to ensure that the grading process is fair and objective. The final plan is then put on permanent file as a reference work in the college library.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=PLAN OF CONCENTRATION|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/academics/undergraduate/plan-of-concentration|website=marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Academic honors===\nLoren Pope, original author of the ''Colleges that Change Lives'' college guide and former education editor for ''The New York Times'', writes about Marlboro, \"You will find the Marlboro adventure far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone.

Essays may take the form of text, images, audio, or video. Submissions are judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students. Finalists are flown to the Marlboro campus for a Symposium where they present their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5123/Marlboro%20launches%202017%20Beautiful%20Minds%20Challenge|title=Marlboro launches 2017 Beautiful Minds Challenge|website=Marlboro College website}}</ref> The Beautiful Minds Challenge was discontinued after the 2018 competition.\n\n==People==\n===Notable faculty===\n* [[Wyn Cooper]] taught at Marlboro.\n* [[Jay Craven]] teaches film at Marlboro.\n* [[Paul LeBlanc (college president)|Paul J.

During the Spring and Fall, students are encouraged to \"plant, weed, landscape, and harvest on a regular basis\" on the school farm. Once a semester, a campuswide Work Day, in the spirit of the original class which built their own dormitories, encourages students, staff, and faculty to maintain campus through various projects that change depending on the needs of the campus. \"Midnight Breakfast\" is an event celebrated each semester the eve before writing portfolios are due.\n\nThe school was founded on and continues to encourage a tradition of community participation and values. A weekly \"[[town meeting]]\" allows all community members to gather and vote to change the college bylaws. An elected community court dispenses justice when necessary. Different elected committees, consisting of students, faculty and staff, help to hire faculty (or even college presidents) and steer the curriculum, among many other responsibilities.\n\nThe library is also open all night and uses a self-checkout honor system to keep track of borrowed materials. All buildings, academic and residential, are open 24/7 to allow students to access materials and workspaces at their discretion.\n\nAthletics are also shaped by Marlboro's location, and by Vermont's long winters &ndash; the coldest weather coincides with the academic year. Though few organized sports teams exist, the school's \"Outdoor Program\" promotes activities such as rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, hiking, and the annual February broomball tournament, a collegiate tradition maintained since 1998. In addition, the College is just 15 miles from the [[Mount Snow]] ski resort.\n\n==Student publications==\nEditors-in-chief of the College's different magazines are elected during town meetings. The administration of the school publishes a biannual magazine, ''Potash Hill''. A [[student newspaper]], ''The Citizen'', is published monthly on campus. \"Articles in The Citizen vary from serious editorials to tongue-in-cheek campus news, from oblique photo-essays to \u201cHorrorscopes\u201d like \u201cSagittarius: Money from strangers can be expected.

ELI hosts the most intense beamline system worldwide, develop new interdisciplinary research opportunities with light from these [[lasers]] and [[secondary radiation]] derived from them, and make them available to the international scientific user community. ELI aims to be the world's biggest and first international user facility in beamline and laser research.\n\nThe facility will be based on four sites. Three of them are presently being implemented in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]], with an investment volume exceeding \u20ac850 million, mostly stemming from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF). In [[Doln\u00ed B\u0159e\u017eany]], near [[Prague]], Czech Republic, the ELI Beamlines facility is developing short-pulse secondary sources of radiation and particles. The ELI Attosecond Light Pulse Source (ELI-ALPS) in [[Szeged]], Hungary is establishing a unique facility which provides light sources within an extremely broad frequency range in the form of ultrashort pulses with high repetition rate. In  [[M\u0103gurele]], Romania, the ELI Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) facility is focusing on laser-based nuclear physics. The location of ELI's fourth pillar, the highest-intensity pillar, is still to be decided. Its laser power is expected to exceed that of the current ELI pillars by about one order of magnitude.\n\n==History==\nThe Extreme Light Infrastructure project started as a bottom-up initiative by the European scientific laser community and the network of large national laser facilities, LASERLAB-EUROPE, in the context of the preparation of the first European ESFRI Roadmap in 2005. From 2007 to 2010 ELI entered into a [[European Commission|European-Commission]]-funded preparatory phase, comprising 40 laboratories from 13 countries. [[G\u00e9rard Mourou]], the initiator of the ELI project, was the coordinator of the preparatory phase.\n\nAt the meeting of the Steering Committee on October 1, 2009 in Prague, the ELI Preparatory Phase Consortium officially gave the mandate to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania to proceed towards the construction of ELI. On December 10, 2010, at the end of the preparatory phase, the project was fully handed over to the ELI Delivery Consortium, consisting of representatives from the three host countries. ERDF funding of the ELI-Beamlines facility in the Czech Republic was granted by the European Commission on April 20, 2011, followed by ELI-Nuclear Physics in Romania on September 18, 2012. Funding for the ELI-ALPS facility in Hungary was granted in early 2014.\n\nThe ELI Delivery Consortium International Association was founded on April 11, 2013 as an international non-profit association under Belgian law ([[AISBL]]). It promotes the sustainable development of ELI as a pan-European research infrastructure, supports the coordinated implementation of the ELI research facilities, and preserves the consistency and complementarity of their scientific missions. It also organises the establishment of an international consortium that will be in charge of the future operation of ELI, preferably in the form of a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (ERIC). The ELI-DC International Association is open to membership by institutions from all interested countries.\n\n==ELI research centres==\n\n===ELI Beamlines===\nThe main goal at ELI Beamlines is to create the most advanced laser equipment in the world. This will be accomplished and implemented through research projects covering the interaction of light with matter at intensities that are 10 times higher than the values that are currently achievable. With ultra-short laser pulses that last only some femtoseconds and performances of up to 10 PW ELI will bring new techniques and tools for basic research as well as for areas such as medical imaging and diagnostics, radiotherapy, new materials, and X-ray optics.\n\nELI Beamlines Laser Center is a unique top-class device built for Czech and international scientific research \u2013 for users who carry out basic and applied research experiments using four ultra-intensive laser systems (L1-L4), which are gradually put into full operation.\n\nELI Beamlines is designed as a high-energy and high-repetitive pillar of the European ELI (Extreme Light Infrastructure) project. The main objective of the project is, in accordance with the ELI White Paper [1], to create a high-energy beam device that can develop and utilize ultra-short pulses of high energy particles and radiation stemming from relativistic and ultrarelativistic interactions. The ELI Beamlines Center strives to address one of the \u201cmajor challenges\u201d, namely generating ultrashort pulses of energy particle beams (& gt; 10 GeV) and radiation (up to several MeV) generated by compact laser plasma accelerators. They are expected to support the ultra-high science science, ie to achieve an ultra-relativistic regime.\n\nMore at: [[www.eli-beams.eu]]\n\nBuilding opened in 2015\n\nUser experiments started in 2018\n\n\n'''ELI Beamlines laser systems'''\n\nL1 ALLEGRA - TW laser, 100 millijoule, 1\u00a0kHz - in operation\n\nL2 AMOS - 100 TW laser, 2 Joule, 50\u00a0Hz \n\nL3 HAPLS - 1 PW laser, 30 Joule, 10\u00a0Hz  - in operation \n\nL4 ATON - 10 PW laser, 2 KJoule - in operation\n<br />\n\n\n===ELI-ALPS===\nLocated in Szeged, South-east of Hungary the main objective of ELI-ALPS, the attosecond pillar of the Extreme Light Infrastructure, in accordance with the ELI White Paper is 1) to generate X-UV and X-ray femtosecond and attosecond pulses, for temporal investigation at the attosecond scale of electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, plasmas and solids; 2) source developments (towards high average power, high peak intensity pulses).\n\nThe ELI-ALPS lasers have matchless parameters that enable the generation of unique attosecond pulses and pulsetrain in the VUV and X-ray spectral regions that are not available elsewhere.\n\n'''ELI-ALPS Laser Technology'''\n\nELI-ALPS offers more than just the use of a novel class of state-of-the-art laser systems.

The first system was initially observed in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on June&nbsp;12. The last system dissipated on November&nbsp;6 while located well southeast of [[Newfoundland]]. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. None of the systems existed simultaneously.\n\nOf the season's five tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. However, none of them strengthened into [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Categories|major hurricane]]s, which are Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]]. Along with [[1901 Atlantic hurricane season|1901]], this was the first time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since [[1864 Atlantic hurricane season|1864]] and [[1865 Atlantic hurricane season|1865]].<ref name=\"ACE\"/> Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to [[Texas]], resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado spawned by the storm also caused five fatalities.\n\nThe season's activity was reflected with an [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since [[1890 Atlantic hurricane season|1890]]. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39&nbsp;mph (63&nbsp;km/h), which is tropical storm strength.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/comparison_table.html|title=Atlantic Basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|date=February 2014|work=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:215\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/06/2017 till:01/12/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:12/06/2017 till:16/06/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:21/06/2017 till:28/06/2017 color:C1 text:\"Two (C1)\"\n  from:16/09/2017 till:22/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Three (C2)\"\n  from:03/10/2017 till:11/10/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:01/11/2017 till:06/11/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/06/2017 till:01/07/2017 text:June\n  from:01/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:01/09/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:01/10/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:01/11/2017 text:October\n  from:01/11/2017 till:01/12/2017 text:November\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n| Basin=Atl\n| Image=1902 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n| Formed=June 12\n| Dissipated=June 16\n| 1-min winds=50\n| Pressure=<997\n}}\nIn June, a [[Low-pressure area|low pressure area]] was observed over the western [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"partagas\">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1901-1904/1902.pdf|title=Year 1902|author=Jose Fernandez Partagas and Henry F.

The first system was initially observed in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on June&nbsp;12. The last system dissipated on November&nbsp;6 while located well southeast of [[Newfoundland]]. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. None of the systems existed simultaneously.\n\nOf the season's five tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. However, none of them strengthened into [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Categories|major hurricane]]s, which are Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]]. Along with [[1901 Atlantic hurricane season|1901]], this was the first time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since [[1864 Atlantic hurricane season|1864]] and [[1865 Atlantic hurricane season|1865]].<ref name=\"ACE\"/> Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to [[Texas]], resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado spawned by the storm also caused five fatalities.\n\nThe season's activity was reflected with an [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since [[1890 Atlantic hurricane season|1890]]. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39&nbsp;mph (63&nbsp;km/h), which is tropical storm strength.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/comparison_table.html|title=Atlantic Basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|date=February 2014|work=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:215\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/06/2017 till:01/12/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:12/06/2017 till:16/06/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:21/06/2017 till:28/06/2017 color:C1 text:\"Two (C1)\"\n  from:16/09/2017 till:22/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Three (C2)\"\n  from:03/10/2017 till:11/10/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:01/11/2017 till:06/11/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/06/2017 till:01/07/2017 text:June\n  from:01/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:01/09/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:01/10/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:01/11/2017 text:October\n  from:01/11/2017 till:01/12/2017 text:November\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n| Basin=Atl\n| Image=1902 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n| Formed=June 12\n| Dissipated=June 16\n| 1-min winds=50\n| Pressure=<997\n}}\nIn June, a [[Low-pressure area|low pressure area]] was observed over the western [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"partagas\">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1901-1904/1902.pdf|title=Year 1902|author=Jose Fernandez Partagas and Henry F.

Governance of APNTS is tasked by the [[articles of incorporation]] to the Board of Trustees who are elected usually every four years by members of the Church of the Nazarene in the Asia-Pacific Region. ''Ex-officio'' members are the APNTS President, Regional Director of the Asia-Pacific Region of the Church of the Nazarene, and the Regional Director of the Eurasia Region of the Church of the Nazarene. Members from each of the following fields of the Church of the Nazarene are elected to represent their geographic areas: Australia-New Zealand, Chinese Ministries, Japan, Korea, Melanesia (including Papua New Guinea), the Philippines, Sealands, South Asia, South East Asia, and South Pacific. The Board of Trustees meets annually in Manila, usually prior to the annual graduation ceremony in late March or early April, and elects from within its own group a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary and treasurer (the latter two being citizens of the Philippines as required by Philippine law). Administration of APNTS is tasked by the articles of incorporation to the President of APNTS, who is a member of the Church of the Nazarene, and the administrative council. The president is a member of the Church of the Nazarene elected by the board of trustees usually for a four-year term. The administrative council is nominated by the president and approved by the board of trustees. [[Floyd Cunningham|Dr Floyd T. Cunningham]] served as interim president of APNTS since 29 October 2007,<ref name=\"ncnnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?sid=10000006&id=10005493|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> but was elected unanimously as the fifth president in June 2008.<ref name=\"ncnnews.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10006168|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10006168|archive-date=2 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation and presidency of Donald D. Owens (1977\u20131984) ===\nAs early as 1948 (three years after the establishment of [[Nazarene Theological Seminary]] (NTS) in Kansas City, Missouri), there was a suggestion to establish a Nazarene seminary in Asia. In the mid-1970s, General Superintendent [[Eugene Stowe]] and Director of the World Mission Department of the Church of the Nazarene [[Jerald Johnson]] articulated the need for a graduate-level theological seminary for the denomination in Asia. On 19 January 1977 the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene approved a plan to establish a Far Eastern Nazarene Theological Semiinary (subsequently called Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary) to serve the Asia and Pacific regions of the church because of the particular needs of the church in that part of the world. [[Donald Owens]], Professor of Missions at Nazarene Theological Seminary in Kansas City and formerly a missionary to Korea, was elected to head the new seminary, which would become the first master's-level theological institution of the Church of the Nazarene located outside the United States.<ref name=\"apnts.org\">[http://www.apnts.org/about/history.php history.php]</ref>\n\nAfter considerable discussion, in June 1978 the Board of General Superintendents approved Johnson's recommendation to locate APNTS in Manila, as it was hoped by Johnson that the cosmopolitan setting would provide models for evangelism for the other major cities of Asia and the Pacific. The Church of the Nazarene had directed its attentions to Metro Manila since 1976. Other considerations in favor of Manila were its proximity to an international airport and the possibility of its international students finding opportunities for ministry to their own people in the cosmopolitan area. Johnson and Owens decided to purchase the Children's Garden orphanage run by the Methodist church and formerly owned by the wealthy Tamayo family. The location consisted of 11 acres (4.5 hectares) that included a centrally located chapel, a two-story crafts center, 15 dormitory cottages, a gymnasium, and an office building. The purchase was completed in early 1979. However, changes in administrative responsibilities after the general assembly of June 1980, which resulted in Johnson's election as one of the six general superintendents, and L. Guy Nees being elected as the new director of World Mission, and the subsequent appointment of Owens as director of the Asia Region, caused some reappraisal of the siting of APNTS in Manila. Ultimately, at the instigation of Owens and Johnson, and the recommendation of Nees, it was decided that APNTS would be located in Manila after all.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nBeginning in January 1980, extension seminars of two fortnight-long intensive modules were held in January each year, involving several NTS professors as well as Angelito Agbuya, pastor of the Angeles City, Philippines, Church of the Nazarene. Owens and Willard Taylor, dean of NTS, taught the initial two modules, and other NTS professors (including Paul Bassett and Paul Orjala) taught in subsequent years. Students represented various countries in the Asia and South Pacific regions<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nOwens moved to Manila in 1980 and began arguing that APNTS ought to be a distinct entity, rather than an extension of NTS. As extension classes were held over the next few years, general church leaders decided that the new seminary should become autonomous from NTS, with its own board of trustees and corporate identity. On 22 September 1982, upon the recommendation of Owens, the World Mission Division officially renamed the school Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIn preparation for the opening of a residential program, Owens searched for faculty members. Owens saw the necessity of developing a resident and increasingly Asian and Pacific faculty, which could apply the church's theology to the contexts of the students. On 27 September 1982, the Board of General Superintendents approved a faculty nominated by Owens that included two Asians and two Westerners: Ronald Beech, missionary in the Philippines since 1962, who had completed a doctorate at Asia Baptist Graduate Theological Seminary in Baguio; Angelito Agbuya, pastor of the growing Angeles City church, and taking doctoral work in education; Alexander Verughese, a native of India, then teaching at Eastern Nazarene College and completing his doctorate at Drew University in Old Testament; and Floyd Cunningham, a doctoral candidate in history at Johns Hopkins University. Verguhese later withdrew due to his health, and Agbuya decided to remain in Angeles City and teach at APNTS only part-time. Consequently, Beech was responsible for setting up the camps, writing the first catalogue, and establishing a curriculum based on that offered by NTS.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe existing buildings on the campus were renovated for student and faculty living, and a new two-storey administration and classroom building (now named Owens Hall in honour of the founding president) was constructed. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 6 January 1983. The first Work and Witness team to serve at APNTS came in January 1983 from Australia to renovate one of the wooden cottages to be used as a dormitory for male students, while Agbuya taught in one of the modules.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nOn 3 August 1983, the Commission on Immigration and Deportation, Department of Justice, Republic of the Philippines, gave its approval for APNTS to begin as an educational institution for non-immigrant students. Floyd Cunningham arrived 5 November 1983, having just completed the defence of his doctoral dissertation and regular classes began on 14 November 1983 with three full-time and 20 part-time students, all from the Philippines. The faculty included Owens, Agbuya, Dr. Ronald and Mrs. Neva Beech (long-time missionaries in the Philippines), and Dr. Floyd Cunningham. The seminary was formally dedicated and the faculty installed on 15 January 1984. Owens chose the motto of the school, \"Bridging cultures for Christ,\" and the school's logo. Mrs Neva Beech suggested the school hymn, \"In Christ There is No East or West\",<ref>[http://www.apnts.edu.ph/resourcecenter/mediator/Owens_Some_Reflections(5.2).pdf Owens_Some_Reflections(5.2).pdf]</ref> which was based on [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 8:11. Soon after, Owens resigned as president of APNTS as he felt that maintaining both jobs, regional director of Asia and president of the school, was too much.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\n=== Presidency of E. LeBron Fairbanks (1984\u20131989) ===\nIn April 1984, E. LeBron Fairbanks, formerly academic dean of [[European Nazarene College|European Nazarene Bible College]] and at the time teaching at [[Southern Nazarene University]], was elected president of the seminary by the Board of General Superintendents. He began serving in the office in July 1984, and he and his wife Anne and son Stephen moved to Manila later that year. Fairnbanks would continue as the second president of APNTS until July 1989, at which time he accepted election as president of [[Mount Vernon Nazarene University|Mt Vernon Nazarene College]].<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIn July 1984 the first foreign students (from India and South Korea) enrolled, and a student body organization was established with Abner Valenzuela elected as first president. Fairbanks turned his attention to separating and transferring the financial records and administration of the school from the regional office to the seminary, and to helping the faculty articulate a mission statement for APNTS.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe first graduation was held on 5 April 1986, with General Superintendent [[Eugene Stowe]] as speaker. Clemente Haban (Philippines) and Jayaraj Krishnan (India) received Master of Divinity degrees, and Carolina Binavince (Philippines) and Kim Soung-gon (South Korea) received Master of Religious Education degrees. In planning for the future of APNTS, Fairbanks and Jim Edlin, the academic dean (1986\u20131988), wanted to expand the number of Asian and South Pacific faculty members as quickly possible. Wilfredo Manaois from the Visayas region of the Philippines joined the faculty in 1986.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Fairbanks decided that it was in the best interests of the school to secure recognition from the Philippine Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), in spite of the fact that virtually no seminaries in the Philippines had this standing. This required legal incorporation, which was secured. The rationale behind the decision to pursue recognition was to enable non-Filipino students to come on student visas. In addition, if the school were recognized by the government, it would enhance the reputation of the school. Graduates could receive \"special order\" numbers from the government that validated their degrees. Beginning the process in 1985, Fairbanks met with top level government department officials. On 6 December 1986, the Seminary secured its permit to operate, and on 17 August 1988, full recognition of its various degree programs. Accreditation for degree programs was also granted by the Asian Theological Association (ATA) in 1988, and by the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA) in 1991.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the library was strengthened with the addition of several important collections centering on Wesleyan and holiness studies, and came to number over 32,000 volumes by 2005.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nAt the same time, extensive renovation and building programs on campus continued. Those who have served as Campus Development co-ordinators have been:\n* Gordon Gibson (1984\u20131902)\n* Terry Sanders (1992\u20131998)\n* Greg Taylor (1998\u20131999, 2004\u2013present)\n* David Hendrix (1999\u20132004)\n\nFairbanks resigned from APNTS in July 1989 in order to accept the presidency of Mount Vernon Nazarene College in Ohio.\n\n=== Presidency of John M. Nielson (1989\u20132001) ===\nAfter the resignation of Fairbanks, John M. Nielson, then vice president of [[Eastern Nazarene College]], and formerly a missionary for the Church of the Nazarene to Denmark, was elected third president of APNTS in November 1989. He and his wife Janice Nielson settled in Manila in February 1990.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nNielson's philosophy of administration stressed:\n# Transition and progress by continuity;\n# Building consensus rather than operating by decree or by majority;\n# Commitment to delegated authority;\n# Accessibility to faculty and students (with recognition as well for the need for privacy);\n# Unity, equitability, fairness;\n# The Servanthood model;\n# Facilitation of the purpose of the institution.\n\nNielson placed a high priority on worship and took personal interest in chapel services. With a donation of funds in honor of Anna Wooten, Nielson set about renovating the outdoor chapel so that it could be used for regular chapel services. He began having national culture days that would convey understanding among students from various nationalities. Janice Nielson played the organ, taught Christian education of children courses, and began Kid's Klubs.<ref name=\"apnts.org1\">[http://www.apnts.org/about/history.php  history.php]</ref>\n\nOver the 12 years of his presidency, Nielson raised about US$200,000 for endowments, scholarships and various projects. At the same time he secured additional funds from the general church. He also oversaw the beginnings of computerized systems in accounting, in registrar's records, and in the library, and secured better funding for regional faculty members. He initiated agreements with sister holiness denominations for scholarships for students. Discussions with the [[Wesleyan Church]] culminated in that denomination's appointment of and support for Dr. Stanley Clark who served full-time from 2000 to 2004 teaching Christian education. In exchange, Wesleyan students received the same tuition and housing benefits as Nazarene students. He also oversaw revision of the student constitution, and the student handbook.<ref name=\"apnts.org1\"/>\n\nIn 1993 the Asia-Pacific region established a media center on campus, the Fairbanks Media Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=115|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> which enabled APNTS to begin a communication major within the Master of Arts (Religious Education) (MARE) program. In 1996 the Commission on Higher Education gave recognition to a Master of Arts Christian Communication (MACC)degree program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ched.gov.ph/hei_dir/2005HEIsMasterlist/Region04a.pdf|title=The Official Website of Commission on Higher Education|author=|date=|work=ched.gov.ph|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Also in 1996 the faculty publication of ''the Mediator'' began. The Philippines' CHED required graduate schools to issue a journal. The ''Mediator'' (ISSN 1655-4175) seeks to communicate to the APNTS constituency and graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnts.org/resourcecenter/mediator.php|title=Asia - Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary Ministry Resource Center|author=|date=|work=apnts.org|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.apnts.edu.ph/resourcecenter/mediator/Nielson_Reflections(1.1).pdf Nielson_Reflections(1.1).pdf]</ref> It provides a forum and vehicle for faculty publications and seeks contributions from graduates and other interested parties. Several times each year \"The Bridge\" newsletter is published and distributed.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIncreased attention to English as a second language came with the appointment of Beverly Gruver in 1997.\n\nOver the years Nielson defended the international purpose and mission of APNTS. He established within students a \"Christ-culture\" consciousness that transcended social differences. In November 2000 Nielson secured a revision of the composition of the Board of Trustees to include more Asia Pacific region members, and election of them by fields.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe Nielsons left in 2001 for European Nazarene Bible College (now [[European Nazarene College]])where Dr Nielson became the Academic Dean. Dr Floyd Cunningham, a foundation faculty member, and academic dean of APNTS, was appointed Officer in Charge in September 2001. In 2002 the Master of Science of Theology program was developed to help prepare graduates for teaching courses at undergraduate Bible and Theological Colleges and for further graduate work by requiring a thesis.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\n=== Presidency of Hitoshi \"Paul\" Fukue (2003\u20132007) ===\nIn January 2003, the Board of Trustees chose Hitoshi \"Paul\" Fukue as president of APNTS, thus becoming the first president indigenous to the Asia-Pacific region. In 2001, Hitoshi and Mitsuko Fukue had become full-time faculty at APNTS. Fukue had served as a pastor in [[Japan]] for more than 20 years, and had earned a ThD at [[Boston University]], studying [[sociology of religion]]. He began serving as an adjunct professor at APNTS in 1992. Mitsuko had earned an MEd at Boston University and taught both interpersonal and intercultural communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=1210|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Fukue was inaugurated as the fourth president of APNTS in April 2003.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=996|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThrough adjunct professors Charles and Carolyn Seiffert, the [[Free Methodist Church]] signed an agreement with APNTS, similar to the agreement that the school had with the Wesleyan Church, that Free Methodist students would receive the same privileges as Nazarene and Wesleyan students so long as the Free Methodist Church sponsored an APNTS faculty member.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nSince 2001, extensive campus development has taken place. At the center of campus now stands the Nielson Center for [[Education]] and [[Evangelism]], a large, five-storey multi-purpose building which houses the media center for the Asia-Pacific region in the basement, and the seminary administration and the offices for the Philippine Field of the Church of the Nazarene on the first floor. The second floor will be a large auditorium, the third floor a new state of the art library, and the fourth floor more offices and classrooms. Other projects have been new and renovated housing for students and faculty.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/> On 23 March 2007 the Fox Library (located on the third floor of the NCEE building) was dedicated. Completion of the NCEE building and more development is in the plans for the coming years.\n\nIn 2004 the [[Donald D. Owens School of World Mission]] (DOSWM) was inaugurated by the board of trustees as a resource for training students for effective mission service. Its goal is to become the premier missionary training institution for the Church of the Nazarene. Each year it sponsors the Owens Lectures. Those giving the Owens Lectures have been Dr Donald Owens (2004), Dr Robert Coleman (2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=1502|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> and Philip Parshall (2006).

Lebron Fairbanks, former president of APNTS, envisioned a media education and production center. His vision became a reality when the Fairbanks Media Center, now known as WM Communications Asia\u2013Pacific (WMC\u2013AP) was established in 1994 and began offering the region's only Master of Arts program in Christian Communication (MACC). In 2004 the [[Fairbanks School of Communication]] (FSC) was instituted by the Board  of Trustees in order to effectively communicate the gospel in the 21st century through the creative use of media and technology. \"High tech facilities, dedicated faculty, creative students, and a vision to \u201ccommunicate Christ\u2026by all means possible,\u201d are the ingredients for a dynamic  communication studies program at Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary (APNTS) in Manila, Philippines.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nazarenemissions.org/eduation/globalglimpses/pdf/jfm2007GG.pdf |title=jfm2007GG.pdf |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227130720/http://www.nazarenemissions.org/eduation/globalglimpses/pdf/jfm2007GG.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since its inception in June 2006, the FSC has offered informal training, seminars, workshops, and focus programs conducted to prepare ministers for effective ministry through media.

Governance of APNTS is tasked by the [[articles of incorporation]] to the Board of Trustees who are elected usually every four years by members of the Church of the Nazarene in the Asia-Pacific Region. ''Ex-officio'' members are the APNTS President, Regional Director of the Asia-Pacific Region of the Church of the Nazarene, and the Regional Director of the Eurasia Region of the Church of the Nazarene. Members from each of the following fields of the Church of the Nazarene are elected to represent their geographic areas: Australia-New Zealand, Chinese Ministries, Japan, Korea, Melanesia (including Papua New Guinea), the Philippines, Sealands, South Asia, South East Asia, and South Pacific. The Board of Trustees meets annually in Manila, usually prior to the annual graduation ceremony in late March or early April, and elects from within its own group a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary and treasurer (the latter two being citizens of the Philippines as required by Philippine law). Administration of APNTS is tasked by the articles of incorporation to the President of APNTS, who is a member of the Church of the Nazarene, and the administrative council. The president is a member of the Church of the Nazarene elected by the board of trustees usually for a four-year term. The administrative council is nominated by the president and approved by the board of trustees. [[Floyd Cunningham|Dr Floyd T. Cunningham]] served as interim president of APNTS since 29 October 2007,<ref name=\"ncnnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?sid=10000006&id=10005493|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> but was elected unanimously as the fifth president in June 2008.<ref name=\"ncnnews.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10006168|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=10006168|archive-date=2 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation and presidency of Donald D. Owens (1977\u20131984) ===\nAs early as 1948 (three years after the establishment of [[Nazarene Theological Seminary]] (NTS) in Kansas City, Missouri), there was a suggestion to establish a Nazarene seminary in Asia. In the mid-1970s, General Superintendent [[Eugene Stowe]] and Director of the World Mission Department of the Church of the Nazarene [[Jerald Johnson]] articulated the need for a graduate-level theological seminary for the denomination in Asia. On 19 January 1977 the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene approved a plan to establish a Far Eastern Nazarene Theological Semiinary (subsequently called Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary) to serve the Asia and Pacific regions of the church because of the particular needs of the church in that part of the world. [[Donald Owens]], Professor of Missions at Nazarene Theological Seminary in Kansas City and formerly a missionary to Korea, was elected to head the new seminary, which would become the first master's-level theological institution of the Church of the Nazarene located outside the United States.<ref name=\"apnts.org\">[http://www.apnts.org/about/history.php history.php]</ref>\n\nAfter considerable discussion, in June 1978 the Board of General Superintendents approved Johnson's recommendation to locate APNTS in Manila, as it was hoped by Johnson that the cosmopolitan setting would provide models for evangelism for the other major cities of Asia and the Pacific. The Church of the Nazarene had directed its attentions to Metro Manila since 1976. Other considerations in favor of Manila were its proximity to an international airport and the possibility of its international students finding opportunities for ministry to their own people in the cosmopolitan area. Johnson and Owens decided to purchase the Children's Garden orphanage run by the Methodist church and formerly owned by the wealthy Tamayo family. The location consisted of 11 acres (4.5 hectares) that included a centrally located chapel, a two-story crafts center, 15 dormitory cottages, a gymnasium, and an office building. The purchase was completed in early 1979. However, changes in administrative responsibilities after the general assembly of June 1980, which resulted in Johnson's election as one of the six general superintendents, and L. Guy Nees being elected as the new director of World Mission, and the subsequent appointment of Owens as director of the Asia Region, caused some reappraisal of the siting of APNTS in Manila. Ultimately, at the instigation of Owens and Johnson, and the recommendation of Nees, it was decided that APNTS would be located in Manila after all.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nBeginning in January 1980, extension seminars of two fortnight-long intensive modules were held in January each year, involving several NTS professors as well as Angelito Agbuya, pastor of the Angeles City, Philippines, Church of the Nazarene. Owens and Willard Taylor, dean of NTS, taught the initial two modules, and other NTS professors (including Paul Bassett and Paul Orjala) taught in subsequent years. Students represented various countries in the Asia and South Pacific regions<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nOwens moved to Manila in 1980 and began arguing that APNTS ought to be a distinct entity, rather than an extension of NTS. As extension classes were held over the next few years, general church leaders decided that the new seminary should become autonomous from NTS, with its own board of trustees and corporate identity. On 22 September 1982, upon the recommendation of Owens, the World Mission Division officially renamed the school Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIn preparation for the opening of a residential program, Owens searched for faculty members. Owens saw the necessity of developing a resident and increasingly Asian and Pacific faculty, which could apply the church's theology to the contexts of the students. On 27 September 1982, the Board of General Superintendents approved a faculty nominated by Owens that included two Asians and two Westerners: Ronald Beech, missionary in the Philippines since 1962, who had completed a doctorate at Asia Baptist Graduate Theological Seminary in Baguio; Angelito Agbuya, pastor of the growing Angeles City church, and taking doctoral work in education; Alexander Verughese, a native of India, then teaching at Eastern Nazarene College and completing his doctorate at Drew University in Old Testament; and Floyd Cunningham, a doctoral candidate in history at Johns Hopkins University. Verguhese later withdrew due to his health, and Agbuya decided to remain in Angeles City and teach at APNTS only part-time. Consequently, Beech was responsible for setting up the camps, writing the first catalogue, and establishing a curriculum based on that offered by NTS.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe existing buildings on the campus were renovated for student and faculty living, and a new two-storey administration and classroom building (now named Owens Hall in honour of the founding president) was constructed. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 6 January 1983. The first Work and Witness team to serve at APNTS came in January 1983 from Australia to renovate one of the wooden cottages to be used as a dormitory for male students, while Agbuya taught in one of the modules.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nOn 3 August 1983, the Commission on Immigration and Deportation, Department of Justice, Republic of the Philippines, gave its approval for APNTS to begin as an educational institution for non-immigrant students. Floyd Cunningham arrived 5 November 1983, having just completed the defence of his doctoral dissertation and regular classes began on 14 November 1983 with three full-time and 20 part-time students, all from the Philippines. The faculty included Owens, Agbuya, Dr. Ronald and Mrs. Neva Beech (long-time missionaries in the Philippines), and Dr. Floyd Cunningham. The seminary was formally dedicated and the faculty installed on 15 January 1984. Owens chose the motto of the school, \"Bridging cultures for Christ,\" and the school's logo. Mrs Neva Beech suggested the school hymn, \"In Christ There is No East or West\",<ref>[http://www.apnts.edu.ph/resourcecenter/mediator/Owens_Some_Reflections(5.2).pdf Owens_Some_Reflections(5.2).pdf]</ref> which was based on [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 8:11. Soon after, Owens resigned as president of APNTS as he felt that maintaining both jobs, regional director of Asia and president of the school, was too much.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\n=== Presidency of E. LeBron Fairbanks (1984\u20131989) ===\nIn April 1984, E. LeBron Fairbanks, formerly academic dean of [[European Nazarene College|European Nazarene Bible College]] and at the time teaching at [[Southern Nazarene University]], was elected president of the seminary by the Board of General Superintendents. He began serving in the office in July 1984, and he and his wife Anne and son Stephen moved to Manila later that year. Fairnbanks would continue as the second president of APNTS until July 1989, at which time he accepted election as president of [[Mount Vernon Nazarene University|Mt Vernon Nazarene College]].<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIn July 1984 the first foreign students (from India and South Korea) enrolled, and a student body organization was established with Abner Valenzuela elected as first president. Fairbanks turned his attention to separating and transferring the financial records and administration of the school from the regional office to the seminary, and to helping the faculty articulate a mission statement for APNTS.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe first graduation was held on 5 April 1986, with General Superintendent [[Eugene Stowe]] as speaker. Clemente Haban (Philippines) and Jayaraj Krishnan (India) received Master of Divinity degrees, and Carolina Binavince (Philippines) and Kim Soung-gon (South Korea) received Master of Religious Education degrees. In planning for the future of APNTS, Fairbanks and Jim Edlin, the academic dean (1986\u20131988), wanted to expand the number of Asian and South Pacific faculty members as quickly possible. Wilfredo Manaois from the Visayas region of the Philippines joined the faculty in 1986.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Fairbanks decided that it was in the best interests of the school to secure recognition from the Philippine Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), in spite of the fact that virtually no seminaries in the Philippines had this standing. This required legal incorporation, which was secured. The rationale behind the decision to pursue recognition was to enable non-Filipino students to come on student visas. In addition, if the school were recognized by the government, it would enhance the reputation of the school. Graduates could receive \"special order\" numbers from the government that validated their degrees. Beginning the process in 1985, Fairbanks met with top level government department officials. On 6 December 1986, the Seminary secured its permit to operate, and on 17 August 1988, full recognition of its various degree programs. Accreditation for degree programs was also granted by the Asian Theological Association (ATA) in 1988, and by the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA) in 1991.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the library was strengthened with the addition of several important collections centering on Wesleyan and holiness studies, and came to number over 32,000 volumes by 2005.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nAt the same time, extensive renovation and building programs on campus continued. Those who have served as Campus Development co-ordinators have been:\n* Gordon Gibson (1984\u20131902)\n* Terry Sanders (1992\u20131998)\n* Greg Taylor (1998\u20131999, 2004\u2013present)\n* David Hendrix (1999\u20132004)\n\nFairbanks resigned from APNTS in July 1989 in order to accept the presidency of Mount Vernon Nazarene College in Ohio.\n\n=== Presidency of John M. Nielson (1989\u20132001) ===\nAfter the resignation of Fairbanks, John M. Nielson, then vice president of [[Eastern Nazarene College]], and formerly a missionary for the Church of the Nazarene to Denmark, was elected third president of APNTS in November 1989. He and his wife Janice Nielson settled in Manila in February 1990.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nNielson's philosophy of administration stressed:\n# Transition and progress by continuity;\n# Building consensus rather than operating by decree or by majority;\n# Commitment to delegated authority;\n# Accessibility to faculty and students (with recognition as well for the need for privacy);\n# Unity, equitability, fairness;\n# The Servanthood model;\n# Facilitation of the purpose of the institution.\n\nNielson placed a high priority on worship and took personal interest in chapel services. With a donation of funds in honor of Anna Wooten, Nielson set about renovating the outdoor chapel so that it could be used for regular chapel services. He began having national culture days that would convey understanding among students from various nationalities. Janice Nielson played the organ, taught Christian education of children courses, and began Kid's Klubs.<ref name=\"apnts.org1\">[http://www.apnts.org/about/history.php  history.php]</ref>\n\nOver the 12 years of his presidency, Nielson raised about US$200,000 for endowments, scholarships and various projects. At the same time he secured additional funds from the general church. He also oversaw the beginnings of computerized systems in accounting, in registrar's records, and in the library, and secured better funding for regional faculty members. He initiated agreements with sister holiness denominations for scholarships for students. Discussions with the [[Wesleyan Church]] culminated in that denomination's appointment of and support for Dr. Stanley Clark who served full-time from 2000 to 2004 teaching Christian education. In exchange, Wesleyan students received the same tuition and housing benefits as Nazarene students. He also oversaw revision of the student constitution, and the student handbook.<ref name=\"apnts.org1\"/>\n\nIn 1993 the Asia-Pacific region established a media center on campus, the Fairbanks Media Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=115|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> which enabled APNTS to begin a communication major within the Master of Arts (Religious Education) (MARE) program. In 1996 the Commission on Higher Education gave recognition to a Master of Arts Christian Communication (MACC)degree program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ched.gov.ph/hei_dir/2005HEIsMasterlist/Region04a.pdf|title=The Official Website of Commission on Higher Education|author=|date=|work=ched.gov.ph|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Also in 1996 the faculty publication of ''the Mediator'' began. The Philippines' CHED required graduate schools to issue a journal. The ''Mediator'' (ISSN 1655-4175) seeks to communicate to the APNTS constituency and graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnts.org/resourcecenter/mediator.php|title=Asia - Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary Ministry Resource Center|author=|date=|work=apnts.org|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.apnts.edu.ph/resourcecenter/mediator/Nielson_Reflections(1.1).pdf Nielson_Reflections(1.1).pdf]</ref> It provides a forum and vehicle for faculty publications and seeks contributions from graduates and other interested parties. Several times each year \"The Bridge\" newsletter is published and distributed.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nIncreased attention to English as a second language came with the appointment of Beverly Gruver in 1997.\n\nOver the years Nielson defended the international purpose and mission of APNTS. He established within students a \"Christ-culture\" consciousness that transcended social differences. In November 2000 Nielson secured a revision of the composition of the Board of Trustees to include more Asia Pacific region members, and election of them by fields.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThe Nielsons left in 2001 for European Nazarene Bible College (now [[European Nazarene College]])where Dr Nielson became the Academic Dean. Dr Floyd Cunningham, a foundation faculty member, and academic dean of APNTS, was appointed Officer in Charge in September 2001. In 2002 the Master of Science of Theology program was developed to help prepare graduates for teaching courses at undergraduate Bible and Theological Colleges and for further graduate work by requiring a thesis.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\n=== Presidency of Hitoshi \"Paul\" Fukue (2003\u20132007) ===\nIn January 2003, the Board of Trustees chose Hitoshi \"Paul\" Fukue as president of APNTS, thus becoming the first president indigenous to the Asia-Pacific region. In 2001, Hitoshi and Mitsuko Fukue had become full-time faculty at APNTS. Fukue had served as a pastor in [[Japan]] for more than 20 years, and had earned a ThD at [[Boston University]], studying [[sociology of religion]]. He began serving as an adjunct professor at APNTS in 1992. Mitsuko had earned an MEd at Boston University and taught both interpersonal and intercultural communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=1210|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> Fukue was inaugurated as the fourth president of APNTS in April 2003.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/html/ncn/article.jsp?id=996|title=- Church of the Nazarene|author=|date=|work=ncnnews.com|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nThrough adjunct professors Charles and Carolyn Seiffert, the [[Free Methodist Church]] signed an agreement with APNTS, similar to the agreement that the school had with the Wesleyan Church, that Free Methodist students would receive the same privileges as Nazarene and Wesleyan students so long as the Free Methodist Church sponsored an APNTS faculty member.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/>\n\nSince 2001, extensive campus development has taken place. At the center of campus now stands the Nielson Center for [[Education]] and [[Evangelism]], a large, five-storey multi-purpose building which houses the media center for the Asia-Pacific region in the basement, and the seminary administration and the offices for the Philippine Field of the Church of the Nazarene on the first floor. The second floor will be a large auditorium, the third floor a new state of the art library, and the fourth floor more offices and classrooms. Other projects have been new and renovated housing for students and faculty.<ref name=\"apnts.org\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/> On 23 March 2007 the Fox Library (located on the third floor of the NCEE building) was dedicated.

The rich diversity of species reflects the valley's location within a transition zone between the [[Zanskar]] and [[Great Himalayas]] ranges to the north and south, respectively, and between the [[Eastern Himalaya]] and Western Himalaya flora. A number of plant species are considered [[threatened]]. Several have not been recorded outside of Uttarakhand. Two have not been recorded in Nanda Devi National Park. The diversity of threatened species of medicinal plants is higher than has been recorded in other Indian Himalayan protected areas. The entire [[Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve]] lies within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA). The Valley of Flowers National Park is the second core zone of the [[Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve]]. Seven restricted-range bird species are endemic to this part of the EBA.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Valley_of_Flowers_(VoF).jpg|center|thumb|642x642px|<center>Valley of Flowers (VoF)</center>]]\n\n===Location===\nThe Valley of Flowers is nestled in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga near Joshimath in Garhwal region. The lower reaches of Bhyundar Ganga near Gobindghat are known as Bhyundar Valley. The Valley of Flowers is in the Pushpawati valley 23&nbsp;km north-northwest of Nanda Devi Park, It lies between 30\u00b0 41' to 30\u00b0 48'N and 79\u00b0 33' to 79\u00b0 46'E.\n\nThe Valley is 20&nbsp;km northwest of [[Nanda Devi National Park]] across the wide valley of the Bhyundar Ganga. It is one of two hanging valleys lying at the head of the Bhyundar valley,<ref name=bhatt/> the other being the shorter [[Hemkund]] valley which runs parallel some 10&nbsp;km south. It runs east-west approximately 15&nbsp;km by an average of 6&nbsp;km wide, in the basin of the Pushpawati river, a small tributary flowing from the Tipra glacier which descends from Gauri Parbat in the east.\n\nThe area lies on the [[Zanskar]] range of the Himalayas with the highest point in the national park being [[Gauri parbat]] at 6,719 m above sea level.\n[[Image:valley of flowers.JPG|thumb|A scene from Valley of Flowers, ''Impatiens sulcata'', This flower paints the Valley of Flowers in pink in the first week of August.]]\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Margaretc.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joan Margaret Legge|Joan Margaret Legge's]] memorial grave]]\n\nThe place was little known to the outside world due to its inaccessibility.

Conditions are generally dry with low annual precipitation, but there is heavy monsoon rainfall from late June to early September. Prevailing mist and low cloud during the monsoon keeps the soil moist, hence the vegetation is lusher than is usual in the drier inner Himalayan valleys. From mid April to June temperatures are moderate to cool (19&nbsp;\u00b0C maximum). The Valley of Flowers also has the micro-climate of an enclosed inner Himalayan valley, and is shielded from the full impact of the southwest summer monsoon by the Greater Himalaya range to its south. There is often dense fog and rain especially during the late summer monsoon. Both Basin and Valley are usually snow-bound for six to seven months between late October and late March, the snow accumulating deeper and at lower altitudes on the shadowed southern than on the northern side of the valleys.<ref>Lamba, B. 1987.

One can also hire a porter, mule or helicopter to reach Ghangaria. The trek from Govindghat to Ghangaria is common to the Sikh Temple at [[Hemkund]] and a trekker is likely to find many Sikh pilgrims on the route. As one nears Ghangaria one is greeted by fields of perfumed wild flowers, wild rose bushes and wild strawberries by the sides of the path. The visitors to Valley of Flowers need to get a permit from Forest Department, at Ghangaria and the permit is valid for three days and visiting and trekking is allowed only during day time.<ref name=bhatt/> As visitors are not allowed to stay inside the National park, accommodation can be obtained at Ghangaria.<ref name=bhatt/><ref name=five/> The best time to visit is between July and early September, when the valley is full of flowers, just after the outbreak of monsoon.<ref name=bhatt/>\n\n==Vegetation==\n[[File:Pushpawati vof2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pushpawati River]] rushing out of the Valley of Flowers]]\nThe valley has three sub-alpine between 3,200 m and 3,500 m which is the limit for trees, lower alpine between 3,500 m and 3,700 m, and higher alpine above 3,700 m. The habitats include valley bottom, river bed, small forests, meadows, eroded, scrubby and stable slopes, moraine, plateau, bogs, stone desert and caves. The lower surrounding hills in the buffer zone are thickly forested. The Forest Research Institute in 1992 recorded 600 species of angiosperms and 30 pteridophytes in the valley and surroundings, discovering 58 new records for the valley of which 4 were new for Himalayan state. Of these plants, 5 out of 6 species globally threatened are not found in [[Nanda Devi National Park]] or elsewhere in [[Uttarakhand]]: ''Aconitum falconeri'', ''A. balfouri'', Himalayan maple (''Acer caesium''), the blue Himalayan poppy (''Meconopsis aculeata'') and ''Saussurea atkinsoni''.

The rich diversity of species reflects the valley's location within a transition zone between the [[Zanskar]] and [[Great Himalayas]] ranges to the north and south, respectively, and between the [[Eastern Himalaya]] and Western Himalaya flora. A number of plant species are considered [[threatened]]. Several have not been recorded outside of Uttarakhand. Two have not been recorded in Nanda Devi National Park. The diversity of threatened species of medicinal plants is higher than has been recorded in other Indian Himalayan protected areas. The entire [[Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve]] lies within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA). The Valley of Flowers National Park is the second core zone of the [[Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve]]. Seven restricted-range bird species are endemic to this part of the EBA.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Valley_of_Flowers_(VoF).jpg|center|thumb|642x642px|<center>Valley of Flowers (VoF)</center>]]\n\n===Location===\nThe Valley of Flowers is nestled in the upper expanses of Bhyundar Ganga near Joshimath in Garhwal region. The lower reaches of Bhyundar Ganga near Gobindghat are known as Bhyundar Valley. The Valley of Flowers is in the Pushpawati valley 23&nbsp;km north-northwest of Nanda Devi Park, It lies between 30\u00b0 41' to 30\u00b0 48'N and 79\u00b0 33' to 79\u00b0 46'E.\n\nThe Valley is 20&nbsp;km northwest of [[Nanda Devi National Park]] across the wide valley of the Bhyundar Ganga.

Conditions are generally dry with low annual precipitation, but there is heavy monsoon rainfall from late June to early September. Prevailing mist and low cloud during the monsoon keeps the soil moist, hence the vegetation is lusher than is usual in the drier inner Himalayan valleys. From mid April to June temperatures are moderate to cool (19&nbsp;\u00b0C maximum). The Valley of Flowers also has the microclimate of an enclosed inner Himalayan valley, and is shielded from the full impact of the southwest summer monsoon by the Greater Himalaya range to its south. There is often dense fog and rain especially during the late summer monsoon. Both Basin and Valley are usually snow-bound for six to seven months between late October and late March, the snow accumulating deeper and at lower altitudes on the shadowed southern than on the northern side of the valleys.<ref>Lamba, B. 1987.

The habitats include valley bottom, river bed, small forests, meadows, eroded, scrubby and stable slopes, moraine, plateau, bogs, stone desert and caves. The lower surrounding hills in the buffer zone are thickly forested. The Forest Research Institute in 1992 recorded 600 species of angiosperms and 30 pteridophytes in the valley and surroundings, discovering 58 new records for the valley of which 4 were new for Himalayan state. Of these plants, 5 out of 6 species globally threatened are not found in [[Nanda Devi National Park]] or elsewhere in [[Uttarakhand]]: ''Aconitum falconeri'', ''A. balfouri'', Himalayan maple (''Acer caesium''), the blue Himalayan poppy (''Meconopsis aculeata'') and ''Saussurea atkinsoni''.

These include ''Aconitum heterophyllum'', ''A. falconeri'', ''Arnebia benthamii'', ''Dactylorhiza hatagirea'', ''Gymnadenia orchides'', ''Megacarpaea polyandra'', ''Picrorhiza kurrooa'', ''Podophyllum hexandrum'' and ''Taxus wallichiana''. Research plots have been set up to determine the best way to control the spread of the tall Himalayan knotweed ''Polygonum polystachium'' without damaging other plants or the surface of the soil. A first annual survey was conducted in 2004 and will be repeated annually.\n\nFlowers mostly [[orchids]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], primulas, [[Calendula|marigold]], [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and anemones carpet the ground.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Sub-alpine]] forests of [[birch]] and [[rhododendron]] cover parts of the park's area. A decade long study of Prof. [[C.P. Kala]] from 1993 onwards concludes that the Valley of Flowers endows with 520 species of higher plants ([[angiosperms]], [[gymnosperms]] and [[pteridophytes]]), of these 498 are [[flowering plants]]. The park has many species of medicinal plants including ''Dactylorhiza hatagirea'', ''Picrorhiza kurrooa'', ''Aconitum violaceum'', ''Polygonatum multiflorum'', ''Fritillaria roylei'' and ''[[Podophyllum hexandrum]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kala, C.P.|year=2005|title= The Valley of Flowers; A newly declared World Heritage Site|url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/sep252005/919.pdf|journal= Current Science|volume= 89|issue=6|pages=919\u2013920}}</ref><ref>Kala, C.P. 2004.
