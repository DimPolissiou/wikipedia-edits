The town lies in [[Ulster]], near the border with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The town is on the main [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 road]] that links [[Dublin]] (to the south) with [[Enniskillen]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Donegal Town]] (to the north). Made for tractors.\n\n==History==\n===Gaelic Cavan 1300-1607===\n\n[[File:Cavan Towne Map 1591.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cavan town from 1591 showing its market square and the O'Reilly castle on Tullymongan Hill]]\nCavan was founded by the clan leader and Lord of [[East Breifne]], Giolla \u00cdosa Ruadh O\u2019Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market. They also allowed counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Kieran|title=The Ui Raghallaigh Lordship of East Breifne c.1250-.c. 1450|journal=Brefne|year=1992|volume=2|series=8|page=415}}</ref> \n\n===Early Modern History===\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]] granted the town a charter in 1610. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690 it was the site of the [[Battle of Cavan]] between [[Glorious Revolution|Williamite and Jacobite troops]], during which much of the town was burned. The Jacobite general [[William Nugent (soldier)|William Nugent]] was killed during the battle.<ref name=\"Battle of Cavan\">{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=The Battle of Cavan, 1690|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=9 February 2007}}</ref> Later, during the 18th century, local administrative influence and power passed to the Maxwell family, descendants of [[Robert Maxwell (bishop)|Robert Maxwell]], [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore]] (1643\u20131672), a family who later entered the [[peerage]] as [[Baron Farnham]].\n\nFarnham House, located at Farnham, a small rural district to the north-west of Cavan, is one of the largest [[English country house|country house]]s in the county. It was built for [[Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham|Barry Maxwell, 3rd Lord Farnham]] (later created, by the second creation, [[Baron Farnham|Earl of Farnham]]), head of the Maxwell dynasty, around 1780. The house was designed by [[James Wyatt]]. It was extended in 1810 to the design of [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], a [[County Armagh]]-born, but Dublin-based, architect. It was sold by Diana, Lady Farnham (widow of [[Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham|Barry Maxwell, 12th Lord Farnham]]), to a local entrepreneur{{when|date=January 2015}}, and the house and estate has per 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/cavan/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=62251|title=First ever Radisson SAS resort in Ireland to open at Farnham Estate in Cavan - HoganStand|website=www.hoganstand.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817095515/http://www.hoganstand.com/cavan/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=62251|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandin1.com/Ireland-Hotel/FEH/Radisson-SAS-Farnham-Estate|title=Radisson Blu Farnham Estate Hotel, CavanHotels|website=www.irelandin1.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503140843/http://www.irelandin1.com/Ireland-Hotel/FEH/Radisson-SAS-Farnham-Estate|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> been converted into a luxury hotel and leisure complex under the [[Radisson SAS]] international hotel group.\n\nDevelopments in Cavan during the early 19th century saw the building of a new wide street that still bears the name 'Farnham Street'. This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A. Scott]] (1871-1921), the well-known Dublin-based architect from [[Drogheda]], for the then Cavan Urban District Council.<ref name=\"Parker 2012\">Parker, Dr. Ciar\u00e1n, 'Cavan Urban District Council \u2013 A Brief Look Back' in Scott, Dr. Brendan (Ed.), ''Cavan Town, 1610\u20132010: A Brief History''. Cavan Town Council, Cavan, 2012.</ref> The hall was constructed between November 1908 and late 1909, with it being officially opened on Wednesday, 19 January 1910.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's Town Hall Ball|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=12 January 2007}}</ref> The building was officially opened by Mrs. Henrietta Smith (who also laid the foundation stone), wife of [[Councillor]] Louis C.P. Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.

The town lies in [[Ulster]], near the border with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The town is on the main [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 road]] that links [[Dublin]] (to the south) with [[Enniskillen]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Donegal Town]] (to the north).\n\n==History==\n===Gaelic Cavan 1300-1607===\n\n[[File:Cavan Towne Map 1591.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cavan town from 1591 showing its market square and the O'Reilly castle on Tullymongan Hill]]\nCavan was founded by the clan leader and Lord of [[East Breifne]], Giolla \u00cdosa Ruadh O\u2019Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market. They also allowed counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Kieran|title=The Ui Raghallaigh Lordship of East Breifne c.1250-.c. 1450|journal=Brefne|year=1992|volume=2|series=8|page=415}}</ref> \n\n===Early Modern History===\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]] granted the town a charter in 1610. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690 it was the site of the [[Battle of Cavan]] between [[Glorious Revolution|Williamite and Jacobite troops]], during which much of the town was burned. The Jacobite general [[William Nugent (soldier)|William Nugent]] was killed during the battle.<ref name=\"Battle of Cavan\">{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=The Battle of Cavan, 1690|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=9 February 2007}}</ref> Later, during the 18th century, local administrative influence and power passed to the Maxwell family, descendants of [[Robert Maxwell (bishop)|Robert Maxwell]], [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore]] (1643\u20131672), a family who later entered the [[peerage]] as [[Baron Farnham]].\n\nFarnham House, located at Farnham, a small rural district to the north-west of Cavan, is one of the largest [[English country house|country house]]s in the county. It was built for [[Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham|Barry Maxwell, 3rd Lord Farnham]] (later created, by the second creation, [[Baron Farnham|Earl of Farnham]]), head of the Maxwell dynasty, around 1780. The house was designed by [[James Wyatt]]. It was extended in 1810 to the design of [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]], a [[County Armagh]]-born, but Dublin-based, architect.

This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A.

Cavan Town Council, Cavan, 2012.</ref> The hall was constructed between November 1908 and late 1909, with it being officially opened on Wednesday, 19 January 1910.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's Town Hall Ball|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=12 January 2007}}</ref> The building was officially opened by Mrs. Henrietta Smith (who also laid the foundation stone), wife of [[Councillor]] Louis C.P. Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.
