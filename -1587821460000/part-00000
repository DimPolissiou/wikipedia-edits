The season also suffered 4 fatalities; 2 died in [[New South Wales]], 1 in [[Western Australia]] and 1 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. One death was as a direct result of fire, 2 died due to unrelated health complications while fighting fires on their property, and a pilot contracted by the [[NSW Rural Fire Service]] died during an accident.\n\n== Climate summary and predictions ==\n\nThe season was predicted to have above average fire potential for most [[Australian state|states]] including portions of the north west of [[Western Australia]], the north west of the [[Northern Territory]] and large areas of central [[Queensland]] following below average rainfall and above average temperatures in these areas in the months leading up to the fire season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bushfirecrc.com/resources/firenote/northern-australia-seasonal-bushfire-outlook-2013|title=Northern Australian seasonal bushfire

The season also suffered 4 fatalities; 2 died in [[New South Wales]], 1 in [[Western Australia]] and 1 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. One death was as a direct result of fire, 2 died due to unrelated health complications while fighting fires on their property, and a pilot contracted by the [[NSW Rural Fire Service]] died during an accident.\n\n== Climate summary and predictions ==\n\nThe season was predicted to have above average fire potential for most [[Australian state|states]] including portions of the north west of [[Western Australia]], the north west of the [[Northern Territory]] and large areas of central [[Queensland]] following below average rainfall and above average temperatures in these areas in the months leading up to the fire season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bushfirecrc.com/resources/firenote/northern-australia-seasonal-bushfire-outlook-2013|title=Northern Australian seasonal bushfire

These have a distinctive style which bears influences of \"later [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]]\" architecture. Mosques all over India were built in different styles; the most elegant styles developed in areas where indigenous art traditions were strong and local artisans were highly skilled. Thus regional or provincial styles of mosques grew out of local temple or domestic styles, which were conditioned in their turn by climate, terrain, materials, hence the enormous difference between the mosques of [[Bengal]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Gujarat]]. The Babri Mosque followed the architectural school of [[Jaunpur Sultanate]]. When viewed from the west side, it resembled the [[Atala Masjid, Jaunpur|Atala Masjid]] in [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MURuAAAAMAAJ |title=Babri-Masjid Ramjanambhoomi controversy |editor=Asgharali Engineer |publisher=Ajanta Publications |year=1990 |page=37 }}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Architectural style ===\n[[File:Ayodhya disputed site map.png|thumb|Site map of Babri Masjid]]\nThe architecture of the mosque is completely a replica of the mosques in the Delhi Sultanate. Babri was an important mosque of a distinct style, preserved mainly in architecture, [[Indo-Islamic architecture#Architecture of the Delhi Sultanate|developed after the Delhi Sultanate was established]], seen also in the Babari Mosque in the southern suburb of the walled city of Gaur, and the [[Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb|Jamali Kamili Mosque]] built by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. This was the forerunner of the [[Mughal architecture]] style adopted by Akbar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Acoustics ===\n\"A whisper from the Babri Masjid Mihrab could be heard clearly at the other end, 200 feet [60&nbsp;m] away and through the length and breadth of the central court\" according to Graham Pickford, architect to [[Lord William Bentinck]] (1828\u201333). The mosque's acoustics were mentioned by him in his book ''Historic Structures of Oudhe'' where he says \"for a 16th-century building the deployment and projection of voice from the pulpit is considerably advanced, the unique deployment of sound in this structure will astonish the visitor\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Memoirs+of+a+Mosque/1/113887.html|title=Memoirs of a Mosque|last=|first=|date=|work=India Today|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/446468/young-girls-rally-safeguard-secularism.html|title=Young girls rally to safeguard secularism|website=Deccan Herald|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nModern architects have attributed this intriguing acoustic feature to a large recess in the wall of the Mihrab and several recesses in the surrounding walls which functioned as resonators; this design helped everyone to hear the speaker at the Mihrab. The sandstone used in building the Babri Mosque also had resonant qualities which contributed to the unique acoustics.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nThe Babri mosque's Tughluquid style integrated other design components and techniques, such as air cooling systems disguised as Islamic architectural elements like arches, vaults and domes. In the Babri Masjid a passive environmental control system comprised the high ceiling, domes, and six large grille windows. The system helped keep the interior cool by allowing natural ventilation as well as daylight.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe date of construction of the Babri Masjid is uncertain.\nThe inscriptions on the Babri Masjid premises found in the 20th century state that the mosque was built in 935&nbsp;[[Hijri year|AH]] (1528\u201329) by [[Mir Baqi]] in accordance with the wishes of Babur. However, these inscriptions appear to be of a more recent vintage.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nThere are no records of the mosque from this period. The ''[[Baburnama]]'' (Chronicles of Babur) does not mention either the mosque or the destruction of a temple.<ref name=\"KE_1995\"/> The ''[[Ramcharitamanas]]'' of [[Tulsidas]] (1574) and ''Ain-i Akbari'' of [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (AD&nbsp;1598) made no mention of a mosque either.{{sfn|Narain, The Ayodhya Temple Mosque Dispute|1993|p=17}}{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=165-166}} [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], the English traveller who visited Ayodhya around 1611, wrote about the \"ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses\" where Hindus believed the great God \"took flesh upon him to see the ''tamasha'' of the world.\" He found ''pandas'' (Brahmin priests) in the ruins of the fort, recording the names of pilgrims, but there was no mention of a mosque.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|p=9, 120, 164}} [[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]] described in 1634 the \"pretty old castle of Ranichand built by a Bannyan Pagod of that name\" which he described as an antique monument that was \"especially memorable\". He also recorded the fact of Brahmins recording the names of pilgrims.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=xv}}\n\nThe earliest record of a mosque at the site traditionally believed by Hindus to be the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|birthplace of Rama]] comes from [[Jai Singh&nbsp;II]] (or \"Sawai Jai Singh\") \u2013 a Rajput noble in the Mughal court who purchased land and established a ''Jaisinghpura'' in the area surrounding the mosque in 1717 (as he had also done in several other Hindu religious places). The documents of Jai Singh preserved in the Kapad-Dwar collection in the [[City Palace, Jaipur|City Palace Museum]] of [[Jaipur]],{{efn|Professor R.&nbsp;Nath, who has examined these records, concludes that Jai Singh had acquired the land of ''Rama Janmasthan'' in 1717. The ownership of the land was vested in the deity. The hereditary title of the ownership was recognised and enforced by the Mughal State from 1717. He also found a letter from a ''gumastha'' Trilokchand, dated 1723, stating that, while under the Muslim administration people had been prevented from taking a ritual bath in the Saryu river, the establishment of the ''Jaisinghpura'' has removed all impediments.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112-114}}}}\ninclude a sketch map of the Babri Masjid site. The map shows an open court yard and a built structure with three temple spires (''sikharas'') resembling today's Babri Masjid with three domes. The courtyard is labelled ''janmasthan'' and shows a ''Ram chabutra''. The central bay of the built structure is labelled ''chhathi'', which also denotes birthplace.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112-115}}\n\nThe European Jesuit missionary [[Joseph Tiefenthaler]], who lived and worked in India for 38 years (1743\u20131785) and wrote numerous works about India, visited Ayodhya in 1767. [[Johann III Bernoulli|Johann Bernoulli]] translated his work ''Descriptio Indiae'' (in Latin) into French, published in 1788. According to this account, [[Aurangzeb]] (r.&nbsp;1658\u20131707) had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. A mosque with three domes was constructed in its place. However, he also noted, \"others say that it was constructed by 'Babor' [Babur]\". The Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama.<ref name=\"Robert_2003\"/>{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|pp=xvi}}\nquotes from [[Joseph Tiefenthaler|Tiefenthaler]]'s ''Descriptio Indiae'' ({{circa}} 1772): \"Emperor Aurangzeb got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place. Others say that it was constructed by 'Babor'. Fourteen black stone pillars of 5 span high, which had existed at the site of the fortress, are seen there. Twelve of these pillars now support the interior arcades of the mosque. Two (of these 12) are placed at the entrance of the cloister. The two others are part of the tomb of some 'Moor'.... On the left is seen a square box, raised five inches from the ground, with borders made of lime, with a length of more than 5 ells and a maximum width of about 4. The Hindus call it Bedi, i.e., 'the cradle'. The reason for this is that once upon a time, here was a house where Beschan [Vishnu] was born in the form of Ram. It is said that his three brothers too were born here. Aurangzeb or Babor, according to others, got this place razed in order to deny them the noble people, opportunity of practising their superstitions...\"}}\nTiefenthaler was well-versed in Persian and Sanskrit, having written a Sanskrit\u2013Persian dictionary, and other works in Persian. Evidently he did not find an inscription on the walls of the mosque stating that it was constructed under Babur's orders. He \"emphatically attributed it to Aurangzeb, and Babur's name is carried by a few persons\", states writer [[Kishore Kunal]].{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|pp=135\u2013142}}\n\n=== Inscriptions ===\n\n[[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] (Buchanan) did a survey of the Gorakhpur Division in 1813\u201314 on behalf of the British East India Company. His report was never published but partly reused by [[Robert Montgomery Martin|Montgomery Martin]] later. Kishore Kunal examined the original report in the [[British Library]] archives. It states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction \"to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe\". However it said that the mosque at Ayodhya was ascertained to have been built by Babur by \"an inscription on its walls\". The said inscription in Persian was said to have been copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend of Buchanan. The translation however contained five pieces of text, including ''two'' inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by Mir Baqi in the year 935&nbsp;AH or 923&nbsp;AH.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}:\n\"By order of King Babur whose justice is a building reaching to the mansions of heaven, this alighting place of the angels was erected by Meer Baquee a nobleman impressed with the seal of happiness. This is lasting Charity in the year of its construction what declares in manifest \"that good works are lasting.\" (The anagram \"good works are lasting\" represented the year 935. \"From the Tughra: There is no God but God, and Mohammad is the Prophet of God. Say, O'Mohammad, that God is one, that God is holy, unbegetting and unbegotten, and that he hath no equal.\"}}\nThe second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}:\n\"The victorious lord, Mooheyoo Din, Aulumgir, Badshah, the destroyer of infidels, the son of Shah Juhan, the son of Juhangeer Shah; the son of Ukbar Shah; the son of Humayoon Shah, the son of Babur Shah; the son Oomer Sheikh Shah; the son of Soolatan Uboo Saeed; the son of Soolatan Moohammad Shah; the son of Meeran Shah, the son of Shaib-i-Qiran Meer Tymoor.\" \"From the Tughra: In the name of God, most merciful I testify that there is no God but God. He is one, and without equal. I also testify that Mohammad is his Servant and Prophet.\" \"Upon the propitious date of this noble erection, by this weak slave Moohummud Funa Ullah.\"}}\nIn addition to the two inscriptions and their monograms (''turghas''), a fable concerning a dervish called Musha Ashiqan was also included. The translator doubted that the fable was part of the inscription but recorded that the scribe \"positively says that the inscription was executed at the erection of this building\". The translator also had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built by Babur.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nIn 1838, British surveyor [[Robert Montgomery Martin|Montgomery Martin]] wrote that the pillars in the mosque were taken from a Hindu temple. A section of historians, such as [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Sharma]], deny this, and state that such claims of temple demolition sprang up only after the 18th century.<ref name=\"Robert_2003\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEOFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2 |title=Destruction and Conservation of Cultural Property |author=[[Robert Hugh Layton|Robert Layton]] and [[Julian Thomas]] |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=9781134604982 |pages=2\u20139 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Syed Mohammad Asghar the Mutawalli (guardian) of the \"Masjid Baburi at Janmasthan\" filed a petition with the Commissioner of Faizabad asking him to restrain the Hindus that raised a chabutara on the spot regarded as the birthplace of Rama. In the petition, he stated that Babur had inscribed one word \"Allah\" above the door. The District Judge and the Sub-Judge visited the mosque in the presence of all parties and their lawyers and confirmed this fact. No other inscriptions were recorded.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nIn 1889, archaeologist [[Alois Anton F\u00fchrer|Anton F\u00fchrer]] visited the mosque and found three inscriptions. One was a Quranic verse. The inscription XLI was Persian poetry in the metre Ramal, which stated that the mosque was erected by a noble 'Mir Khan' of Babur.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=168}}:\n# By the order of Babur, the king of the world;\n# This firmament-like, lofty;\n# Strong building was erected;\n# By the auspicious noble Mir Khan;\n# May ever remain such a foundation;\n# And such a king of the world.}}\nThe inscription XLII was also Persian poetry in metre Ramal, and said that the mosque was founded in year 930&nbsp;AH by a grandee of Babur, who was (comparable to) \"another King of Turkey and China\".{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=169}}:\n# In the name of God, the merciful, the clement.\n# In the name of him who...; may God perpetually keep him in the world.\n# ....\n# Such a sovereign who is famous in the world and in person of delight for the world.\n# In his presence one of the grandees who is another King of Turkey and China.\n# Laid this religious foundation in the auspicious Hijra 930.\n# O God!

In 1855, after a Hindu-Muslim clash, a boundary wall was constructed to avoid further disputes. It divided the mosque premises into two courtyards; the Muslims offered prayers in the inner courtyard. The Hindus offered their prayers on a raised platform, known as \"Ram Chabutara\", in the outer courtyard.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/><ref name=\"SGopal_1993\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47AARF595dUC&pg=PA65 |title=Anatomy of a Confrontation: Ayodhya and the Rise of Communal Politics in India |author=[[Sarvepalli Gopal]] |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1993 |isbn=9781856490504 |pages=64\u201377 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. After Muslim protests, the Deputy Commissioner prohibited any temple construction on 19 January 1885. On 27 January 1885, Raghubar Das, the Hindu [[mahant]] (priest) of the Ram Chabutara filed a civil suit before the Faizabad Sub-Judge. In response, the ''mutawalli'' (Muslim trustee) of the mosque argued that the entire land belonged to the mosque.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/> On 24 December 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the suit. On 18 March 1886, the District Judge F.E.A. Chamier also dismissed an appeal against the lower court judgment. He agreed that the mosque was built on the land considered sacred by the Hindus, but ordered maintenance of [[status quo]], since it was \"too late now to remedy the grievance\". A subsequent appeal before the Judicial Commissioner W. Young was also dismissed on 1 November 1886.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nOn 27 March 1934, a Hindu\u2013Muslim riot occurred in Ayodhya, triggered by cow slaughter in the nearby Shahjahanpur village. The walls around the Masjid and one of the domes of the Masjid were damaged during the riots. These were reconstructed by the [[British Raj|British Indian government]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Shia\u2013Sunni dispute ===\n\nIn 1936, the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] government enacted U.P. Muslim Waqf Act for the better administration of [[waqf]] properties in the state. In accordance with this act, the Babri Masjid and its adjacent graveyard (Ganj-e-Saheedan Qabristan) were registered as ''Waqf no.&nbsp;26 Faizabad'' with the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs. The [[Shia Islam|Shias]] disputed the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ownership of the mosque, claiming that the site belonged to them because Mir Baqi was a Shia.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/> The Commissioner of Waqfs initiated an inquiry into the dispute. The inquiry concluded that the mosque belonged to the Sunnis, since it was commissioned by Babur, who was a Sunni. The concluding report was published in an official gazette dated 26 February 1944. In 1945, the Shia Central Board moved to court against this decision. On 23 March 1946, Judge S. A. Ahsan ruled in favour of the Sunni Central Board of Waqfs.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\n=== Placement of Hindu idols ===\n\nIn December 1949, the Hindu organisation Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha organised a non-stop 9-day recitation of the ''[[Ramacharitamanas]]'' just outside the mosque. At the end of this event, on the night of 22\u201323 December 1949, a group of 50\u201360 people entered the mosque and placed idols of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] there. On the morning of 23 December, the event organisers asked Hindu devotees to come to the mosque for a ''[[dar\u015bana|darshan]]''. As thousands of Hindus started visiting the place, the Government declared the mosque a disputed area and locked its gates.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nHome Minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] directed the state's Chief Minister [[Govind Ballabh Pant]] and Uttar Pradesh Home Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] to have the idols removed from the mosque premises. Pant issued orders to remove the idols, but Faizabad's deputy commissioner K.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Nayar feared that the Hindus would retaliate and pleaded inability to carry out the orders.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nOn 16 January 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a civil suit in the Faizabad Court, asking that Hindus be allowed to worship Rama and Sita at the place. In 1959, the [[Nirmohi Akhara]] filed another lawsuit demanding possession of the mosque. On 18 December 1961, the Sunni Central Waqf Board also filed a lawsuit, demanding possession of the site and removal of idols from the mosque premises.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\n== Demolition ==\n\n{{main|Demolition of the Babri Masjid}}\n{{Further|Ram Rath Yatra}}\n\nIn April 1984, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) initiated a campaign to gather public support for Hindu access to the Babri Masjid and other structures that had been allegedly built over Hindu shrines. To raise public awareness, VHP planned nationwide ''rath yatra''s (chariot processions<ref>*{{citation |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics |publisher=C.

The campaign was temporarily suspended after [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]], but revived in from 25 places on 23 October 1985. On 25 January 1986, a 28-year-old local lawyer Umesh Chandra Pandey, appealed to a court to remove the restrictions on Hindu worship in the Babri Masjid premises.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/> Subsequently, the [[Rajiv Gandhi]] government ordered the locks on the Babri Masjid gates to be removed. Earlier, the only Hindu ceremony permitted at the site was a Hindu priest performing an annual [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. After the ruling, all Hindus were given access to the site, and the mosque gained some function as a Hindu temple.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/what-if-rajiv-hadnt-unlocked-babri-masjid/224878 |title=What If Rajiv Hadn't Unlocked Babri Masjid? |work=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\nCommunal tension in the region worsened when the VHP received permission to perform a ''shilanyas'' (stone-laying ceremony) at the disputed site before the national election in November 1989. A senior [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) leader, [[L K Advani]], started a ''[[Ram Rath Yatra|rath yatra]]'', embarking on a 10,000&nbsp;km journey starting from the south and heading towards Ayodhya. On 6 December 1992, BJP, VHP and [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] leaders gathered at the site to offer prayers and perform a symbolic ''[[kar seva]]''. At noon, a teenage ''Kar Sevak'' (volunteer) was \"vaulted\" on to the dome and that signalled the breaking of the outer cordon. Soon after, a large number of ''kar sevak''s demolished the mosque.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nCommunal riots between Hindus and Muslims occurred across India immediately following demolition of the mosque.

It has been a [[Ayodhya dispute|focus of dispute]] between the Hindu and Muslim communities since the 18th century. According to the mosque's inscriptions, it was built in 1528\u201329 (935 [[Hijri year|AH]]) by general [[Mir Baqi]], on orders of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]]. The mosque was attacked and demolished by [[Hindu]] [[Karsevak]]s in 1992 and ignited communal violence across the country.\n\nThe mosque was located on a hill known as Ramkot (\"Rama's fort\").<ref name=\"Hiltebeitel2009\">{{citation|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf|title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics: Draupadi among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&pg=PA227|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-34055-5|pages=227\u2013}}</ref> According to Hindus, Baqi destroyed a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site.

These have a distinctive style which bears influences of \"later [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]]\" architecture. Mosques all over India were built in different styles; the most elegant styles developed in areas where indigenous art traditions were strong and local artisans were highly skilled. Thus regional or provincial styles of mosques grew out of local temple or domestic styles, which were conditioned in their turn by climate, terrain, materials, hence the enormous difference between the mosques of [[Bengal]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Gujarat]]. The Babri Mosque followed the architectural school of [[Jaunpur Sultanate]]. When viewed from the west side, it resembled the [[Atala Masjid, Jaunpur|Atala Masjid]] in [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MURuAAAAMAAJ |title=Babri-Masjid Ramjanambhoomi controversy |editor=Asgharali Engineer |publisher=Ajanta Publications |year=1990 |page=37 }}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Architectural style ===\n[[File:Ayodhya disputed site map.png|thumb|Site map of Babri Masjid]]\nThe architecture of the mosque is completely a replica of the mosques in the Delhi Sultanate. Babri was an important mosque of a distinct style, preserved mainly in architecture, [[Indo-Islamic architecture#Architecture of the Delhi Sultanate|developed after the Delhi Sultanate was established]], seen also in the Babari Mosque in the southern suburb of the walled city of Gaur, and the [[Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb|Jamali Kamili Mosque]] built by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. This was the forerunner of the [[Mughal architecture]] style adopted by Akbar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Acoustics ===\n\"A whisper from the Babri Masjid Mihrab could be heard clearly at the other end, 200 feet [60&nbsp;m] away and through the length and breadth of the central court\" according to Graham Pickford, architect to [[Lord William Bentinck]] (1828\u201333). The mosque's acoustics were mentioned by him in his book ''Historic Structures of Oudhe'' where he says \"for a 16th-century building the deployment and projection of voice from the pulpit is considerably advanced, the unique deployment of sound in this structure will astonish the visitor\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Memoirs+of+a+Mosque/1/113887.html|title=Memoirs of a Mosque|last=|first=|date=|work=India Today|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/446468/young-girls-rally-safeguard-secularism.html|title=Young girls rally to safeguard secularism|website=Deccan Herald|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nModern architects have attributed this intriguing acoustic feature to a large recess in the wall of the Mihrab and several recesses in the surrounding walls which functioned as resonators; this design helped everyone to hear the speaker at the Mihrab. The sandstone used in building the Babri Mosque also had resonant qualities which contributed to the unique acoustics.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Ventilation ===\nThe Babri mosque's Tughluquid style integrated other design components and techniques, such as air cooling systems disguised as Islamic architectural elements like arches, vaults and domes. In the Babri Masjid a passive environmental control system comprised the high ceiling, domes, and six large grille windows. The system helped keep the interior cool by allowing natural ventilation as well as daylight.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe date of construction of the Babri Masjid is uncertain.\nThe inscriptions on the Babri Masjid premises found in the 20th century state that the mosque was built in 935&nbsp;[[Hijri year|AH]] (1528\u201329) by [[Mir Baqi]] in accordance with the wishes of Babur. However, these inscriptions appear to be of a more recent vintage.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nThere are no records of the mosque from this period. The ''[[Baburnama]]'' (Chronicles of Babur) does not mention either the mosque or the destruction of a temple.<ref name=\"KE_1995\"/> The ''[[Ramcharitamanas]]'' of [[Tulsidas]] (1574) and ''Ain-i Akbari'' of [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (AD&nbsp;1598) made no mention of a mosque either.{{sfn|Narain, The Ayodhya Temple Mosque Dispute|1993|p=17}}{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=165-166}} [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], the English traveller who visited Ayodhya around 1611, wrote about the \"ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses\" where Hindus believed the great God \"took flesh upon him to see the ''tamasha'' of the world.\" He found ''pandas'' (Brahmin priests) in the ruins of the fort, recording the names of pilgrims, but there was no mention of a mosque.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|p=9, 120, 164}} [[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]] described in 1634 the \"pretty old castle of Ranichand built by a Bannyan Pagod of that name\" which he described as an antique monument that was \"especially memorable\".

The documents of Jai Singh preserved in the Kapad-Dwar collection in the [[City Palace, Jaipur|City Palace Museum]] of [[Jaipur]],{{efn|Professor R.&nbsp;Nath, who has examined these records, concludes that Jai Singh had acquired the land of ''Rama Janmasthan'' in 1717. The ownership of the land was vested in the deity. The hereditary title of the ownership was recognised and enforced by the Mughal State from 1717. He also found a letter from a ''gumastha'' Trilokchand, dated 1723, stating that, while under the Muslim administration people had been prevented from taking a ritual bath in the Saryu river, the establishment of the ''Jaisinghpura'' has removed all impediments.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112-114}}}}\ninclude a sketch map of the Babri Masjid site. The map shows an open court yard and a built structure with three temple spires (''sikharas'') resembling today's Babri Masjid with three domes. The courtyard is labelled ''janmasthan'' and shows a ''Ram chabutra''. The central bay of the built structure is labelled ''chhathi'', which also denotes birthplace.{{sfn|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112-115}}\n\nThe European Jesuit missionary [[Joseph Tiefenthaler]], who lived and worked in India for 38 years (1743\u20131785) and wrote numerous works about India, visited Ayodhya in 1767. [[Johann III Bernoulli|Johann Bernoulli]] translated his work ''Descriptio Indiae'' (in Latin) into French, published in 1788. According to this account, [[Aurangzeb]] (r.&nbsp;1658\u20131707) had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. A mosque with three domes was constructed in its place. However, he also noted, \"others say that it was constructed by 'Babor' [Babur]\". The Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama.<ref name=\"Robert_2003\"/>{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|pp=xvi}}\nquotes from [[Joseph Tiefenthaler|Tiefenthaler]]'s ''Descriptio Indiae'' ({{circa}} 1772): \"Emperor Aurangzeb got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place. Others say that it was constructed by 'Babor'. Fourteen black stone pillars of 5 span high, which had existed at the site of the fortress, are seen there. Twelve of these pillars now support the interior arcades of the mosque. Two (of these 12) are placed at the entrance of the cloister. The two others are part of the tomb of some 'Moor'.... On the left is seen a square box, raised five inches from the ground, with borders made of lime, with a length of more than 5 ells and a maximum width of about 4. The Hindus call it Bedi, i.e., 'the cradle'. The reason for this is that once upon a time, here was a house where Beschan [Vishnu] was born in the form of Ram. It is said that his three brothers too were born here. Aurangzeb or Babor, according to others, got this place razed in order to deny them the noble people, opportunity of practising their superstitions...\"}}\nTiefenthaler was well-versed in Persian and Sanskrit, having written a Sanskrit\u2013Persian dictionary, and other works in Persian. Evidently he did not find an inscription on the walls of the mosque stating that it was constructed under Babur's orders. He \"emphatically attributed it to Aurangzeb, and Babur's name is carried by a few persons\", states writer [[Kishore Kunal]].{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|pp=135\u2013142}}\n\n=== Inscriptions ===\n\n[[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] (Buchanan) did a survey of the Gorakhpur Division in 1813\u201314 on behalf of the British East India Company. His report was never published but partly reused by [[Robert Montgomery Martin|Montgomery Martin]] later. Kishore Kunal examined the original report in the [[British Library]] archives. It states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction \"to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe\". However it said that the mosque at Ayodhya was ascertained to have been built by Babur by \"an inscription on its walls\". The said inscription in Persian was said to have been copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend of Buchanan. The translation however contained five pieces of text, including ''two'' inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by Mir Baqi in the year 935&nbsp;AH or 923&nbsp;AH.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}:\n\"By order of King Babur whose justice is a building reaching to the mansions of heaven, this alighting place of the angels was erected by Meer Baquee a nobleman impressed with the seal of happiness. This is lasting Charity in the year of its construction what declares in manifest \"that good works are lasting.\" (The anagram \"good works are lasting\" represented the year 935. \"From the Tughra: There is no God but God, and Mohammad is the Prophet of God. Say, O'Mohammad, that God is one, that God is holy, unbegetting and unbegotten, and that he hath no equal.\"}}\nThe second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}:\n\"The victorious lord, Mooheyoo Din, Aulumgir, Badshah, the destroyer of infidels, the son of Shah Juhan, the son of Juhangeer Shah; the son of Ukbar Shah; the son of Humayoon Shah, the son of Babur Shah; the son Oomer Sheikh Shah; the son of Soolatan Uboo Saeed; the son of Soolatan Moohammad Shah; the son of Meeran Shah, the son of Shaib-i-Qiran Meer Tymoor.\" \"From the Tughra: In the name of God, most merciful I testify that there is no God but God. He is one, and without equal. I also testify that Mohammad is his Servant and Prophet.\" \"Upon the propitious date of this noble erection, by this weak slave Moohummud Funa Ullah.\"}}\nIn addition to the two inscriptions and their monograms (''turghas''), a fable concerning a dervish called Musha Ashiqan was also included. The translator doubted that the fable was part of the inscription but recorded that the scribe \"positively says that the inscription was executed at the erection of this building\". The translator also had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built by Babur.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nIn 1838, British surveyor [[Robert Montgomery Martin|Montgomery Martin]] wrote that the pillars in the mosque were taken from a Hindu temple. A section of historians, such as [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Sharma]], deny this, and state that such claims of temple demolition sprang up only after the 18th century.<ref name=\"Robert_2003\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEOFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2 |title=Destruction and Conservation of Cultural Property |author=[[Robert Hugh Layton|Robert Layton]] and [[Julian Thomas]] |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=9781134604982 |pages=2\u20139 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Syed Mohammad Asghar the Mutawalli (guardian) of the \"Masjid Baburi at Janmasthan\" filed a petition with the Commissioner of Faizabad asking him to restrain the Hindus that raised a chabutara on the spot regarded as the birthplace of Rama. In the petition, he stated that Babur had inscribed one word \"Allah\" above the door. The District Judge and the Sub-Judge visited the mosque in the presence of all parties and their lawyers and confirmed this fact. No other inscriptions were recorded.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|loc=Chapter 5}}\n\nIn 1889, archaeologist [[Alois Anton F\u00fchrer|Anton F\u00fchrer]] visited the mosque and found three inscriptions. One was a Quranic verse. The inscription XLI was Persian poetry in the metre Ramal, which stated that the mosque was erected by a noble 'Mir Khan' of Babur.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=168}}:\n# By the order of Babur, the king of the world;\n# This firmament-like, lofty;\n# Strong building was erected;\n# By the auspicious noble Mir Khan;\n# May ever remain such a foundation;\n# And such a king of the world.}}\nThe inscription XLII was also Persian poetry in metre Ramal, and said that the mosque was founded in year 930&nbsp;AH by a grandee of Babur, who was (comparable to) \"another King of Turkey and China\".{{efn|{{harvnb|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=169}}:\n# In the name of God, the merciful, the clement.\n# In the name of him who...; may God perpetually keep him in the world.\n# ....\n# Such a sovereign who is famous in the world and in person of delight for the world.\n# In his presence one of the grandees who is another King of Turkey and China.\n# Laid this religious foundation in the auspicious Hijra 930.\n# O God!

In 1855, after a Hindu-Muslim clash, a boundary wall was constructed to avoid further disputes. It divided the mosque premises into two courtyards; the Muslims offered prayers in the inner courtyard. The Hindus offered their prayers on a raised platform, known as \"Ram Chabutara\", in the outer courtyard.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/><ref name=\"SGopal_1993\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47AARF595dUC&pg=PA65 |title=Anatomy of a Confrontation: Ayodhya and the Rise of Communal Politics in India |author=[[Sarvepalli Gopal]] |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1993 |isbn=9781856490504 |pages=64\u201377 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. After Muslim protests, the Deputy Commissioner prohibited any temple construction on 19 January 1885. On 27 January 1885, Raghubar Das, the Hindu [[mahant]] (priest) of the Ram Chabutara filed a civil suit before the Faizabad Sub-Judge. In response, the ''mutawalli'' (Muslim trustee) of the mosque argued that the entire land belonged to the mosque.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/> On 24 December 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the suit. On 18 March 1886, the District Judge F.E.A. Chamier also dismissed an appeal against the lower court judgment. He agreed that the mosque was built on the land considered sacred by the Hindus, but ordered maintenance of [[status quo]], since it was \"too late now to remedy the grievance\". A subsequent appeal before the Judicial Commissioner W. Young was also dismissed on 1 November 1886.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nOn 27 March 1934, a Hindu\u2013Muslim riot occurred in Ayodhya, triggered by cow slaughter in the nearby Shahjahanpur village. The walls around the Masjid and one of the domes of the Masjid were damaged during the riots. These were reconstructed by the [[British Raj|British Indian government]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Shia\u2013Sunni dispute ===\n\nIn 1936, the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] government enacted U.P. Muslim Waqf Act for the better administration of [[waqf]] properties in the state. In accordance with this act, the Babri Masjid and its adjacent graveyard (Ganj-e-Saheedan Qabristan) were registered as ''Waqf no.&nbsp;26 Faizabad'' with the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs. The [[Shia Islam|Shias]] disputed the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ownership of the mosque, claiming that the site belonged to them because Mir Baqi was a Shia.<ref name=\"Roma_2014\"/> The Commissioner of Waqfs initiated an inquiry into the dispute. The inquiry concluded that the mosque belonged to the Sunnis, since it was commissioned by Babur, who was a Sunni. The concluding report was published in an official gazette dated 26 February 1944. In 1945, the Shia Central Board moved to court against this decision. On 23 March 1946, Judge S. A. Ahsan ruled in favour of the Sunni Central Board of Waqfs.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\n=== Placement of Hindu idols ===\n\nIn December 1949, the Hindu organisation Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha organised a non-stop 9-day recitation of the ''[[Ramacharitamanas]]'' just outside the mosque. At the end of this event, on the night of 22\u201323 December 1949, a group of 50\u201360 people entered the mosque and placed idols of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] there. On the morning of 23 December, the event organisers asked Hindu devotees to come to the mosque for a ''[[dar\u015bana|darshan]]''. As thousands of Hindus started visiting the place, the Government declared the mosque a disputed area and locked its gates.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nHome Minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] directed the state's Chief Minister [[Govind Ballabh Pant]] and Uttar Pradesh Home Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] to have the idols removed from the mosque premises. Pant issued orders to remove the idols, but Faizabad's deputy commissioner K.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Nayar feared that the Hindus would retaliate and pleaded inability to carry out the orders.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\nOn 16 January 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a civil suit in the Faizabad Court, asking that Hindus be allowed to worship Rama and Sita at the place. In 1959, the [[Nirmohi Akhara]] filed another lawsuit demanding possession of the mosque. On 18 December 1961, the Sunni Central Waqf Board also filed a lawsuit, demanding possession of the site and removal of idols from the mosque premises.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/>\n\n== Demolition ==\n\n{{main|Demolition of the Babri Masjid}}\n{{Further|Ram Rath Yatra}}\n\nIn April 1984, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) initiated a campaign to gather public support for Hindu access to the Babri Masjid and other structures that had been allegedly built over Hindu shrines. To raise public awareness, VHP planned nationwide ''rath yatra''s (chariot processions<ref>*{{citation |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics |publisher=C.

The campaign was temporarily suspended after [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]], but revived in from 25 places on 23 October 1985. On 25 January 1986, a 28-year-old local lawyer Umesh Chandra Pandey, appealed to a court to remove the restrictions on Hindu worship in the Babri Masjid premises.<ref name=\"SGopal_1993\"/> Subsequently, the [[Rajiv Gandhi]] government ordered the locks on the Babri Masjid gates to be removed. Earlier, the only Hindu ceremony permitted at the site was a Hindu priest performing an annual [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. After the ruling, all Hindus were given access to the site, and the mosque gained some function as a Hindu temple.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/what-if-rajiv-hadnt-unlocked-babri-masjid/224878 |title=What If Rajiv Hadn't Unlocked Babri Masjid? |work=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\nCommunal tension in the region worsened when the VHP received permission to perform a ''shilanyas'' (stone-laying ceremony) at the disputed site before the national election in November 1989. A senior [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) leader, [[L K Advani]], started a ''[[Ram Rath Yatra|rath yatra]]'', embarking on a 10,000&nbsp;km journey starting from the south and heading towards Ayodhya. On 6 December 1992, BJP, VHP and [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] leaders gathered at the site to offer prayers and perform a symbolic ''[[kar seva]]''. At noon, a teenage ''Kar Sevak'' (volunteer) was \"vaulted\" on to the dome and that signalled the breaking of the outer cordon. Soon after, a large number of ''kar sevak''s demolished the mosque.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nCommunal riots between Hindus and Muslims occurred across India immediately following demolition of the mosque.

The Fair Trading Minister, Anthony Roberts, said that issue of vaccination was one of life and death and that the organization's activities endangered people's safety. Mr Roberts has warned other states against the AVN trying to register.

The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was an [[Unnamed Tropical Storm (1987)|unnamed tropical storm]] which formed on August 9, nearly a month later than usual.<ref name=TCclimate>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=November 24, 2007|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071213074803/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml| archivedate=December 13, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The final storm of the year, [[Tropical Depression Fourteen (1987)|Tropical Depression Fourteen]], merged with a weak [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] low on November 4. The season marked the first year [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watches and warnings]] were issued; previously, gale watches and warnings were used for tropical storms, and this season was one of only a few seasons with no deaths in the United States; the last time this happened was in the [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season|1981 season]].\n\nDuring this season, 14&nbsp;tropical depressions formed of which seven attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Three tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which only one became a [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]], which is a Category&nbsp;3 or greater on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. [[Hurricane Emily (1987)|Hurricane Emily]] was the costliest storm of the season, causing $80.3&nbsp;million in damage (1987&nbsp;USD) as it ravaged the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Bermuda]]. Tropical Depression Fourteen was the deadliest storm of the season, causing six deaths as it passed across Jamaica. Of the seven cyclones that attained tropical storm status, three did not affect land.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts and activity==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+'''Predictions of tropical activity in the 1987 season'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n|align=\"center\"|'''Source'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''Date'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Named<br/>storms</span>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Hurricanes</span>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Major<br/>hurricanes</span>'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Colorado State University|CSU]]\n|June 2\n|8\n|5\n|N/A\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|''Record high activity''<!--This is for seasons prior to 1987 so any records set 1988-2010 do not count. -->\n|[[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|21]]\n|[[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|12]]\n|[[1950 Atlantic hurricane season|8]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|''Record low activity''\n|[[1914 Atlantic hurricane season|1]]\n|[[1914 Atlantic hurricane season|0]] ([[1907 Atlantic hurricane season|tie]])\n|0\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|'''Actual activity'''\n| 7\n| 3\n| 1\n|-\n|}\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by hurricane expert Dr. [[William M.

Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs]. Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased.

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

The city is identified with the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city of Ayodhya]], and as such, is the birthplace of [[Rama]] and setting of the epic ''[[Ramayana]]''. The accuracy of this identification is central to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]: modern scholars variously believe that the present-day Ayodhya is same as the legendary Ayodhya, or that the legendary city is a mythical place that came to be identified with the present-day Ayodhya only during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] around the 4th-5th century CE.\n\nThe present-day city is identified as the location of Saketa, which was an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]] in the first millennium BCE, and later served as its capital. The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]] visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five [[tirthankara]]s namely, [[Rishabhanatha]], [[Ajitanatha]], [[Abhinandananatha]], [[Sumatinath]] and [[Anantnath]], and associate it with the legendary [[chakravarti (Sanskrit term)#Jain tradition|chakravartins]]. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.\n\nOwing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites ([[Sapta Puri|Saptapuri]]) for Hindus. It is believed that the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|birth spot of Rama]] was marked by a temple, which is said to have been demolished by the orders of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]] and a disputed mosque erected in its place. The Ayodhya dispute concerns the activism by the  Hindu groups to rebuild a grand Rama's temple at the site of Janmabhoomi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/ayodhya-verdict-live-updates-sc-ruling-in-ram-mandir-babri-masjid-ayodhya-land-dispute-case-today-hindus-muslim-119110900133_1.html|title=Ayodhya verdict: No place for fear, negativity in 'New India', says PM|last=Team|first=BS Web|website=www.business-standard.com|language=en|access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref> The five judges [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court, headed by [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]] [[Ranjan Gogoi]], vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records. It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered to the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque.\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nThe word \"Ayodhya\" is a regularly formed derivation of the [[Sanskrit]] verb ''yudh'', \"to fight, to wage war\".  ''Yodhya'' is the future passive participle, meaning \"to be fought\"; the initial ''a'' is the negative prefix; the whole, therefore, means \"not to be fought\" or, more idiomatically in English, \"invincible\".{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=2}} This meaning is attested by the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', which uses it to refer to the unconquerable city of gods.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=103}} The 9th century [[Jain]] poem ''[[Adi Purana]]'' also states that Ayodhya \"does not exist by name alone but by the merit\" of being unconquerable by enemies. ''Satyopakhyana'' interprets the word slightly differently, stating that it means \"that which cannot be conquered by sins\" (instead of enemies).{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=4}}\n\n\"Saketa\" is the older name for the city, attested in Sanskrit, Jain, Sanskrit, Buddhist, Greek and Chinese sources.{{sfn|Lutgendorf, Imagining Ayodhya|1997|p=22}} According to [[Vaman Shivram Apte]], the word \"Saketa\" is derived from the Sanskrit words ''Saha'' (with) and ''Aketen'' (houses or buildings). The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is called Saketa \"because of its magnificent buildings which had significant banners as their arms\". {{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}} According to [[Hans T. Bakker]], the word may be derived from the roots ''sa'' and ''ketu'' (\"with banner\"); the variant name ''saketu'' is attested in the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}\n\nAyodhya was stated to be the capital of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom in the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Hence it was also referred to as \"Kosala\". The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is famous as ''su-ko\u015bala'' \"because of its prosperity and good skill\".{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}}\n\nThe cities of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] (Thailand), and [[Yogyakarta]] (Indonesia), are named after Ayodhya.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|Gold carving depiction of the legendary Ayodhya at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]]]]\n\nThe earliest of the Buddhist [[Pali canon|Pali-language texts]] and the Jain Prakrit-language texts mention a city called Saketa (Sageya or Saeya in Prakrit) as an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=5-6}} Topographical indications in both Buddhist and Jain texts suggest that Saketa is the same as the present-day Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} For example, according to the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' and the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'', Saketa was located at a distance of six ''[[yojana]]''s from [[Shravasti]]. The ''Vinaya Pitaka'' mentions that a big river was located between the two cities, and the ''[[Sutta Nipata]]'' mentions Saketa as the first halting place on the southward road from Shravasti to [[Pratishthana]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}\n\nAncient [[Sanskrit]]-language epics, such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' mention a [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city called Ayodhya]], which was the capital of the legendary [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] kings of Kosala, including Rama.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} Neither these texts, nor the earlier Sanskrit texts such as the [[Vedas]], mention a city called Saketa. Non-religious, non-legendary ancient Sanskrit texts, such as Panini's ''Ashtadhyayi'' and Patanjali's commentary on it, do mention Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} The later Buddhist text ''[[Mahavastu]]'' describes Saketa as the seat of the Ikshvaku king Sujata, whose descendants established the [[Shakya]] capital [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}\n\nFourth century onwards, multiple texts, including Kalidasa's ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', mention Ayodhya as another name for Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=6-7}} The later Jain canonical text ''Jambudvipa-Pannati'' describes a city called Viniya (or Vinita) as the birthplace of [[Rishabha|Lord Rishabhanatha]], and associates this city with [[Bharata Chakravartin]]; the ''[[Kalpa Sutra|Kalpa-Sutra]]'' describes Ikkhagabhumi as the birthplace of Rishabhadev. The index on the Jain text ''Paumachariya'' clarifies that Aojjha (Aodhya), Kosala-puri (\"Kosala city\"), Viniya, and Saeya (Saketa) are synonyms. The post-Canonical Jain texts also mention \"Aojjha\"; for example, the ''Avassagacurni'' describes it as the principal city of Kosala, while the ''Avassaganijjutti'' names it as the capital of [[King Sagara|Sagara Chakravartin]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}} The ''Avassaganijjutti'' implies that Viniya (\"Vinia\"), Kosalapuri (\"Kosalapura\"), and Ikkhagabhumi were distinct cities, naming them as the capitals of Abhinamdana, Sumai, and Usabha respectively. Abhayadeva's commentary on the ''Thana Sutta'', another post-canonical text, identifies Saketa, Ayodhya, and Vinita as one city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}}\n\nAccording to one theory, the legendary Ayodhya city is the same as the historical city of Saketa and the present-day Ayodhya. According to another theory, the legendary Ayodhya is a mythical city,{{sfn|Arya|1990|p=44}} and the name \"Ayodhya\" came to be used for the Saketa (present-day Ayodhya) only around the fourth century, when a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] emperor (probably [[Skandagupta]]) moved his capital to Saketa, and renamed it to Ayodhya after the legendary city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}<ref>{{cite journal |authors=[[Bhagwan Singh Josh]], [[Bipan Chandra]], [[Harbans Mukhia]], [[K.

There is lack of historical sources about the city's situation for the next few centuries: it is possible that the city remained a commercial centre of secondary importance, but did not grow into a political centre of Magadha, whose capital was located at [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=14}} Several Buddhist buildings may have been constructed in the town during the rule of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE: these buildings were probably located on the present-day man-made mounds in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=14-18}} Excavations at Ayodhya have resulted in the discovery of a large brick wall, identified as a fortification wall by archaeologist [[B. B. Lal]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} This wall probably erected in the last quarter of the 3rd-century BCE.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=19-20}}\n\n[[File:Dhanadeva Ayodhya inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription]], 1st-century BCE.]]\n[[File:Muladeva coin Kosala.jpg|thumb|Coin of ruler Muladeva, of the [[Deva dynasty (Saketa)|Deva dynasty]] minted in Ayodhya, Kosala.

The 1st century BCE [[Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana|inscription of Dhanadeva]] suggests that he appointed a governor there.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''[[Yuga Purana]]'' mentions Saketa as the residence of a governor, and describes it as being attacked by a combined force of [[Yavanas|Greeks]], [[Mathura]]s, and [[Panchala]]s.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=18-19}} Patanjali's commentary on Panini also refers to the Greek siege of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7,19}}\n\nLater, Saketa appears to have become part of a small, independent kingdom.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The ''Yuga Purana'' states that Saketa was ruled by seven powerful kings after the retreat of the Greeks.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''Vayu Purana'' and the ''Brahmanda Purana'' also state that seven powerful kings ruled in the capital of Kosala. The historicity of these kings is attested by the discovery of the coins of the [[Deva dynasty (Saketa)|Deva dynasty]] kings, including Dhanadeva, whose inscription describes him as the king of Kosala (''Kosaladhipati'').{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=21}} As the capital of Kosala, Saketa probably eclipsed Shravasti in importance during this period. The east\u2013west route connecting Pataliputra to [[Taxila]], which earlier passed through Saketa and Shravasti, appears to have shifted southwards during this period, now passing through Saketa, [[Ahichhatra]] and [[Kanyakubja]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=22}}\n\nAfter the Deva kings, Saketa appears to have been ruled by the [[Datta dynasty|Datta]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], and Mitra kings, although the chronological order of their rule is uncertain. Bakker theorises that the [[Datta dynasty|Dattas]] succeeded the Deva kings in the mid-1st century CE, and their kingdom was annexed to the Kushan Empire by [[Kanishka]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} The Tibetan text ''Annals of Li Country'' (c. 11th century) mentions that an alliance of king Vijayakirti of [[Khotan]], king Kanika, the king of Gu-zan, and the king of Li, marched to India and captured the So-ked city. During this invasion, Vijayakirti took several Buddhist relics from Saketa, and placed them in the stupa of Phru-no. If Kanika is identified as Kanishka, and So-ked as Saketa, it appears that the invasion of Kushans and their allies led to the destruction of the Buddhist sites at Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}}\n\nNevertheless, Saketa appears to have remained a prosperous town during the Kushan rule.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}} The 2nd century geographer [[Ptolemy]] mentions a metropolis \"Sageda\" or \"Sagoda\", which has been identified with Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The earliest inscription that mentions Saketa as a place name is dated to the late Kushan period: it was found on the pedestal of a Buddha image in Shravasti, and records the gift of the image by Sihadeva of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} Before or after the Kushans, Saketa appears to have been ruled by a dynasty of kings whose names end in \"-mitra\", and whose coins have been found at Ayodhya. They may have been members of a local dynasty that was distinct from the [[Mitra dynasty]] of Mathura. These kings are attested only by their coinage: Sangha-mitra, Vijaya-mitra, Satya-mitra, Deva-mitra, and Arya-mitra; coins of Kumuda-sena and Aja-varman have also been discovered.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=23}}\n\n=== Gupta period ===\n\nAround the 4th century, the region came under the control of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], who revived [[Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=26}} The ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' attest that the early Gupta kings ruled Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} No Gupta-era archaeological layers have been discovered in present-day Ayodhya, although a large number of Gupta coins have been discovered here. It is possible that during the Gupta period, the habitations in the city were located in the areas that have not yet been excavated.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=27}} The Buddhist sites that had suffered destruction during the Khotanese-Kushan invasion appear to have remained deserted.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=25-26}} The 5th-century Chinese traveller [[Faxian]] states that the ruins of Buddhist buildings existed at \"Sha-chi\" during his time.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=17}} One theory identifies Sha-chi with Saketa, although this identification is not undisputed.<ref>{{cite book |author1=J.

[[Paramartha]] states that king Vikramaditya moved the royal court to Ayodhya; Xuanzang also corroborates this, stating that this king moved the court to the \"country of Shravasti\", that is, Kosala.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} A local oral tradition of Ayodhya, first recorded in writing by [[Robert Montgomery Martin]] in 1838,{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} mentions that the city was deserted after the death of Rama's descendant [[Brihadbala]]. The city remain deserted until King Vikrama of [[Ujjain]] came searching for it, and re-established it. He cut down the forests that had covered the ancient ruins, erected the Ramgar fort, and built 360 temples.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}}\n\nVikramditya was a title of multiple Gupta kings, and the king who moved the capital to Ayodhya is identified as Skandagupta.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} Bakker theorises that the move to Ayodhya may have been prompted by a flooding of the river Ganges at Pataliputra, the need to check the [[Huna people|Huna]] advance from the west, and Skandagupta's desire to compare himself with Rama (whose Ikshvaku dynasty is associated with the legendary Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} According to Paramaratha's ''Life of Vasubandhu'', Vikramaditya was a patron of scholars, and awarded 300,000 pieces of gold to [[Vasubandhu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} The text states that Vasubandhu was a native of Saketa (\"Sha-ki-ta\"), and describes Vikramaditya as the king of Ayodhya (\"A-yu-ja\").{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=8}} This wealth was used to build three monasteries in the country of A-yu-ja (Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} Paramartha further states that the later king Baladitya (identified with [[Narasimhagupta]]) and his mother also awarded large sums of gold to Vasubandhu, and these funds were used to build another Buddhist temple at Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=32}} These structures may have been seen by the 7th century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]], who describes a [[stupa]] and a [[monastery]] at Ayodhya (\"O-yu-t-o\").{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18, 31}}\n\n=== Decline as a political centre ===\n\nAyodhya probably suffered when the Hunas led by [[Mihirakula]] invaded the Gupta empire in the 6th century. After the fall of the Guptas, it may have been ruled by the [[Maukhari]] dynasty, whose coins have been found in the nearby areas. It was not devastated, as Xuanzang describes it as a flourshing town and a Buddhist centre.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=32-33}} However, it had lost its position as an important political centre to [[Kanyakubja]] (Kannauj).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=33-34}} At the time of Xuanzang's visit, it was a part of [[Harsha]]'s empire, and was probably the seat of a vassal or an administrative officer. Xuanzang states that the city measured about 0.6&nbsp;km (20 [[li (unit)|li]]) in circumference. Another 7th-century source, ''[[K\u0101\u015bik\u0101v\u1e5btt\u012b]]'', mentions that the town was surrounded by a moat similar to that around [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=33}}\n\nAfter the fall of Harsha's empire, Ayodhya appears to have been variously controlled by local kings and the rulers of Kannauj, including [[Yashovarman]] and the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s. The town is not mentioned in any surviving texts or inscriptions composed during 650-1050 CE, although it may be identified with the \"city of [[Harishchandra]]\" mentioned in the 8th-century poem ''Gaudavaho''. Archaeological evidence (including images to [[Vishnu]], Jain [[tirthankara]]s, [[Ganesha]], the seven [[Matrikas]], and a Buddhist stupa) suggests that the religious activity in the area continued during this period.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=34}}\n\n=== Early medieval period ===\n\nAccording to Indologist [[Hans T. Bakker]], the only religious significance of Ayodhya in the first millennium CE was related to the ''Gopratara'' [[tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]] (now called Guptar Ghat), where Rama and his followers are said to have ascended to heaven by entering the waters of Sarayu.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=105}}<ref name=Paramasivan />{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=12}}\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Gahadavala]] dynasty came to power in the region, and promoted [[Vaishnavism]]. They built several [[Vishnu]] temples in Ayodhya, five of which survived till the end of [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign. Hans Bakker concludes that there might have been a temple at the supposed birth spot of Rama built by the Gahadavalas (see [[Vishnu Hari inscription]]). In subsequent years, the cult of Rama developed within Vaishnavism, with Rama being regarded as the foremost avatar of Vishnu. Consequently, Ayodhya's importance as a pilgrimage centre grew.<ref name=Paramasivan>{{cite book |last=Paramasivan |first=Vasudha |chapter=Yah Ayodhya Vah Ayodhya: Earthly and Cosmic Journeys in the Anand-lahari |editor=Heidi R.

Muslim historians state that the area was little more than wilderness prior to this. Pilgrimage was tolerated, but the tax on pilgrims ensured that the temples did not receive much income.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya: A Hindu Jerusalem|1991}}\n\n=== Mughal and British period ===\n[[File:Ayodhya seen from the river Ghaghara, Uttar Pradesh.

The city is identified with the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city of Ayodhya]], and as such, is the birthplace of [[Rama]] and setting of the epic ''[[Ramayana]]''. The accuracy of this identification is central to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]: modern scholars variously believe that the present-day Ayodhya is same as the legendary Ayodhya, or that the legendary city is a mythical place that came to be identified with the present-day Ayodhya only during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] around the 4th-5th century CE.\n\nThe present-day city is identified as the location of Saketa, which was an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]] in the first millennium BCE, and later served as its capital. The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]] visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five [[tirthankara]]s namely, [[Rishabhanatha]], [[Ajitanatha]], [[Abhinandananatha]], [[Sumatinath]] and [[Anantnath]], and associate it with the legendary [[chakravarti (Sanskrit term)#Jain tradition|chakravartins]]. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.\n\nOwing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites ([[Sapta Puri|Saptapuri]]) for Hindus. It is believed that the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|birth spot of Rama]] was marked by a temple, which is said to have been demolished by the orders of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]] and a disputed mosque erected in its place. The Ayodhya dispute concerns the activism by the  Hindu groups to rebuild a grand Rama's temple at the site of Janmabhoomi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/ayodhya-verdict-live-updates-sc-ruling-in-ram-mandir-babri-masjid-ayodhya-land-dispute-case-today-hindus-muslim-119110900133_1.html|title=Ayodhya verdict: No place for fear, negativity in 'New India', says PM|last=Team|first=BS Web|website=www.business-standard.com|language=en|access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref> The five judges [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court, headed by [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]] [[Ranjan Gogoi]], vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records. It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered to the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque.\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nThe word \"Ayodhya\" is a regularly formed derivation of the [[Sanskrit]] verb ''yudh'', \"to fight, to wage war\".  ''Yodhya'' is the future passive participle, meaning \"to be fought\"; the initial ''a'' is the negative prefix; the whole, therefore, means \"not to be fought\" or, more idiomatically in English, \"invincible\".{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=2}} This meaning is attested by the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', which uses it to refer to the unconquerable city of gods.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=103}} The 9th century [[Jain]] poem ''[[Adi Purana]]'' also states that Ayodhya \"does not exist by name alone but by the merit\" of being unconquerable by enemies. ''Satyopakhyana'' interprets the word slightly differently, stating that it means \"that which cannot be conquered by sins\" (instead of enemies).{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=4}}\n\n\"Saketa\" is the older name for the city, attested in Sanskrit, Jain, Sanskrit, Buddhist, Greek and Chinese sources.{{sfn|Lutgendorf, Imagining Ayodhya|1997|p=22}} According to [[Vaman Shivram Apte]], the word \"Saketa\" is derived from the Sanskrit words ''Saha'' (with) and ''Aketen'' (houses or buildings). The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is called Saketa \"because of its magnificent buildings which had significant banners as their arms\". {{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}} According to [[Hans T. Bakker]], the word may be derived from the roots ''sa'' and ''ketu'' (\"with banner\"); the variant name ''saketu'' is attested in the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}\n\nAyodhya was stated to be the capital of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom in the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Hence it was also referred to as \"Kosala\". The ''Adi Purana'' states that Ayodhya is famous as ''su-ko\u015bala'' \"because of its prosperity and good skill\".{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=5}}\n\nThe cities of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] (Thailand), and [[Yogyakarta]] (Indonesia), are named after Ayodhya.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|Gold carving depiction of the legendary Ayodhya at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]]]]\n\nThe earliest of the Buddhist [[Pali canon|Pali-language texts]] and the Jain Prakrit-language texts mention a city called Saketa (Sageya or Saeya in Prakrit) as an important city of the [[Kosala]] [[mahajanapada]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=5-6}} Topographical indications in both Buddhist and Jain texts suggest that Saketa is the same as the present-day Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=2}} For example, according to the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' and the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'', Saketa was located at a distance of six ''[[yojana]]''s from [[Shravasti]]. The ''Vinaya Pitaka'' mentions that a big river was located between the two cities, and the ''[[Sutta Nipata]]'' mentions Saketa as the first halting place on the southward road from Shravasti to [[Pratishthana]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}\n\nAncient [[Sanskrit]]-language epics, such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' mention a [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary city called Ayodhya]], which was the capital of the legendary [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] kings of Kosala, including Rama.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} Neither these texts, nor the earlier Sanskrit texts such as the [[Vedas]], mention a city called Saketa. Non-religious, non-legendary ancient Sanskrit texts, such as Panini's ''Ashtadhyayi'' and Patanjali's commentary on it, do mention Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} The later Buddhist text ''[[Mahavastu]]'' describes Saketa as the seat of the Ikshvaku king Sujata, whose descendants established the [[Shakya]] capital [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=5}}\n\nFourth century onwards, multiple texts, including Kalidasa's ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', mention Ayodhya as another name for Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=6-7}} The later Jain canonical text ''Jambudvipa-Pannati'' describes a city called Viniya (or Vinita) as the birthplace of [[Rishabha|Lord Rishabhanatha]], and associates this city with [[Bharata Chakravartin]]; the ''[[Kalpa Sutra|Kalpa-Sutra]]'' describes Ikkhagabhumi as the birthplace of Rishabhadev. The index on the Jain text ''Paumachariya'' clarifies that Aojjha (Aodhya), Kosala-puri (\"Kosala city\"), Viniya, and Saeya (Saketa) are synonyms. The post-Canonical Jain texts also mention \"Aojjha\"; for example, the ''Avassagacurni'' describes it as the principal city of Kosala, while the ''Avassaganijjutti'' names it as the capital of [[King Sagara|Sagara Chakravartin]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}} The ''Avassaganijjutti'' implies that Viniya (\"Vinia\"), Kosalapuri (\"Kosalapura\"), and Ikkhagabhumi were distinct cities, naming them as the capitals of Abhinamdana, Sumai, and Usabha respectively. Abhayadeva's commentary on the ''Thana Sutta'', another post-canonical text, identifies Saketa, Ayodhya, and Vinita as one city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=6}}\n\nAccording to one theory, the legendary Ayodhya city is the same as the historical city of Saketa and the present-day Ayodhya. According to another theory, the legendary Ayodhya is a mythical city,{{sfn|Arya|1990|p=44}} and the name \"Ayodhya\" came to be used for the Saketa (present-day Ayodhya) only around the fourth century, when a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] emperor (probably [[Skandagupta]]) moved his capital to Saketa, and renamed it to Ayodhya after the legendary city.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=12}}<ref>{{cite journal |authors=[[Bhagwan Singh Josh]], [[Bipan Chandra]], [[Harbans Mukhia]], [[K.

There is lack of historical sources about the city's situation for the next few centuries: it is possible that the city remained a commercial centre of secondary importance, but did not grow into a political centre of Magadha, whose capital was located at [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=14}} Several Buddhist buildings may have been constructed in the town during the rule of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE: these buildings were probably located on the present-day man-made mounds in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=14-18}} Excavations at Ayodhya have resulted in the discovery of a large brick wall, identified as a fortification wall by archaeologist [[B.

The 1st century BCE [[Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana|inscription of Dhanadeva]] suggests that he appointed a governor there.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''[[Yuga Purana]]'' mentions Saketa as the residence of a governor, and describes it as being attacked by a combined force of [[Yavanas|Greeks]], [[Mathura]]s, and [[Panchala]]s.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=18-19}} Patanjali's commentary on Panini also refers to the Greek siege of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7,19}}\n\nLater, Saketa appears to have become part of a small, independent kingdom.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The ''Yuga Purana'' states that Saketa was ruled by seven powerful kings after the retreat of the Greeks.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=20}} The ''Vayu Purana'' and the ''Brahmanda Purana'' also state that seven powerful kings ruled in the capital of Kosala. The historicity of these kings is attested by the discovery of the coins of the [[Deva dynasty (Saketa)|Deva dynasty]] kings, including Dhanadeva, whose inscription describes him as the king of Kosala (''Kosaladhipati'').{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=21}} As the capital of Kosala, Saketa probably eclipsed Shravasti in importance during this period. The east-west route connecting Pataliputra to [[Taxila]], which earlier passed through Saketa and Shravasti, appears to have shifted southwards during this period, now passing through Saketa, [[Ahichhatra]] and [[Kanyakubja]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=22}}\n\nAfter the Deva kings, Saketa appears to have been ruled by the [[Datta dynasty|Datta]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], and Mitra kings, although the chronological order of their rule is uncertain. Bakker theorises that the [[Datta dynasty|Dattas]] succeeded the Deva kings in the mid-1st century CE, and their kingdom was annexed to the Kushan Empire by [[Kanishka]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} The Tibetan text ''Annals of Li Country'' (c. 11th century) mentions that an alliance of king Vijayakirti of [[Khotan]], king Kanika, the king of Gu-zan, and the king of Li, marched to India and captured the So-ked city. During this invasion, Vijayakirti took several Buddhist relics from Saketa, and placed them in the stupa of Phru-no. If Kanika is identified as Kanishka, and So-ked as Saketa, it appears that the invasion of Kushans and their allies led to the destruction of the Buddhist sites at Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}}\n\nNevertheless, Saketa appears to have remained a prosperous town during the Kushan rule.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=25}} The 2nd century geographer [[Ptolemy]] mentions a metropolis \"Sageda\" or \"Sagoda\", which has been identified with Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18}} The earliest inscription that mentions Saketa as a place name is dated to the late Kushan period: it was found on the pedestal of a Buddha image in Shravasti, and records the gift of the image by Sihadeva of Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=24}} Before or after the Kushans, Saketa appears to have been ruled by a dynasty of kings whose names end in \"-mitra\", and whose coins have been found at Ayodhya. They may have been members of a local dynasty that was distinct from the [[Mitra dynasty]] of Mathura. These kings are attested only by their coinage: Sangha-mitra, Vijaya-mitra, Satya-mitra, Deva-mitra, and Arya-mitra; coins of Kumuda-sena and Aja-varman have also been discovered.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=23}}\n\n=== Gupta period ===\n\nAround the 4th century, the region came under the control of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], who revived [[Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=26}} The ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' attest that the early Gupta kings ruled Saketa.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=7}} No Gupta-era archaeological layers have been discovered in present-day Ayodhya, although a large number of Gupta coins have been discovered here. It is possible that during the Gupta period, the habitations in the city were located in the areas that have not yet been excavated.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=27}} The Buddhist sites that had suffered destruction during the Khotanese-Kushan invasion appear to have remained deserted.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=25-26}} The 5th-century Chinese traveller [[Faxian]] states that the ruins of Buddhist buildings existed at \"Sha-chi\" during his time.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=17}} One theory identifies Sha-chi with Saketa, although this identification is not undisputed.<ref>{{cite book |author1=J.

[[Paramartha]] states that king Vikramaditya moved the royal court to Ayodhya; Xuanzang also corroborates this, stating that this king moved the court to the \"country of Shravasti\", that is, Kosala.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} A local oral tradition of Ayodhya, first recorded in writing by [[Robert Montgomery Martin]] in 1838,{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} mentions that the city was deserted after the death of Rama's descendant [[Brihadbala]]. The city remain deserted until King Vikrama of [[Ujjain]] came searching for it, and re-established it. He cut down the forests that had covered the ancient ruins, erected the Ramgar fort, and built 360 temples.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}}\n\nVikramditya was a title of multiple Gupta kings, and the king who moved the capital to Ayodhya is identified as Skandagupta.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=29}} Bakker theorises that the move to Ayodhya may have been prompted by a flooding of the river Ganges at Pataliputra, the need to check the [[Huna people|Huna]] advance from the west, and Skandagupta's desire to compare himself with Rama (whose Ikshvaku dynasty is associated with the legendary Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=30}} According to Paramaratha's ''Life of Vasubandhu'', Vikramaditya was a patron of scholars, and awarded 300,000 pieces of gold to [[Vasubandhu]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} The text states that Vasubandhu was a native of Saketa (\"Sha-ki-ta\"), and describes Vikramaditya as the king of Ayodhya (\"A-yu-ja\").{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=8}} This wealth was used to build three monasteries in the country of A-yu-ja (Ayodhya).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=31}} Paramartha further states that the later king Baladitya (identified with [[Narasimhagupta]]) and his mother also awarded large sums of gold to Vasubandhu, and these funds were used to build another Buddhist temple at Ayodhya.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=32}} These structures may have been seen by the 7th century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]], who describes a [[stupa]] and a [[monastery]] at Ayodhya (\"O-yu-t-o\").{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=18, 31}}\n\n=== Decline as a political centre ===\n\nAyodhya probably suffered when the Hunas led by [[Mihirakula]] invaded the Gupta empire in the 6th century. After the fall of the Guptas, it may have been ruled by the [[Maukhari]] dynasty, whose coins have been found in the nearby areas. It was not devastated, as Xuanzang describes it as a flourshing town and a Buddhist centre.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=32-33}} However, it had lost its position as an important political centre to [[Kanyakubja]] (Kannauj).{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|pp=33-34}} At the time of Xuanzang's visit, it was a part of [[Harsha]]'s empire, and was probably the seat of a vassal or an administrative officer. Xuanzang states that the city measured about 0.6&nbsp;km (20 [[li (unit)|li]]) in circumference. Another 7th-century source, ''[[K\u0101\u015bik\u0101v\u1e5btt\u012b]]'', mentions that the town was surrounded by a moat similar to that around [[Pataliputra]].{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=33}}\n\nAfter the fall of Harsha's empire, Ayodhya appears to have been variously controlled by local kings and the rulers of Kannauj, including [[Yashovarman]] and the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s. The town is not mentioned in any surviving texts or inscriptions composed during 650-1050 CE, although it may be identified with the \"city of [[Harishchandra]]\" mentioned in the 8th-century poem ''Gaudavaho''. Archaeological evidence (including images to [[Vishnu]], Jain [[tirthankara]]s, [[Ganesha]], the seven [[Matrikas]], and a Buddhist stupa) suggests that the religious activity in the area continued during this period.{{sfn|Bakker, Ayodhya, Part 1|1984|p=34}}\n\n=== Early medieval period ===\n\nAccording to Indologist [[Hans T. Bakker]], the only religious significance of Ayodhya in the first millennium CE was related to the ''Gopratara'' [[tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]] (now called Guptar Ghat), where Rama and his followers are said to have ascended to heaven by entering the waters of Sarayu.{{sfn|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982|p=105}}<ref name=Paramasivan />{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=12}}\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Gahadavala]] dynasty came to power in the region, and promoted [[Vaishnavism]]. They built several [[Vishnu]] temples in Ayodhya, five of which survived till the end of [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign. Hans Bakker concludes that there might have been a temple at the supposed birth spot of Rama built by the Gahadavalas (see [[Vishnu Hari inscription]]). In subsequent years, the cult of Rama developed within Vaishnavism, with Rama being regarded as the foremost avatar of Vishnu. Consequently, Ayodhya's importance as a pilgrimage centre grew.<ref name=Paramasivan>{{cite book |last=Paramasivan |first=Vasudha |chapter=Yah Ayodhya Vah Ayodhya: Earthly and Cosmic Journeys in the Anand-lahari |editor=Heidi R.

A verse in the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' names Ayodhya among \"the most sacred and foremost cities\", the others being [[Mathura]], [[Haridwar|Haridvara]], [[Varanasi|Kashi]], [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]] and [[Ujjain|Avantika]]. This verse is also found in the other [[Purana]]s with slight variations.{{sfn|Kunal, Ayodhya Revisited|2016|p=2}} In [[Garuda Purana]], Ayodhya is said to be one of seven holiest places for [[Hindus]] in [[India]], with [[Varanasi]] being the most sacrosanct.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C&pg=PA3|title=The Hindu temple, Volume 1 |author1=Stella Kramrisch |author2=Raymond Burnier |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |page=3 |isbn=9788120802230|year=1946}}</ref>\n\n=== Hanuman Garhi Fort ===\n[[Hanumangarhi|Hanuman Garhi]], a massive four-sided fort with circular bastions at each corner and a temple of Hanuman inside, is the most popular shrine in Ayodhya. Situated in the center of town, it is approachable by a flight of 76 steps. Its legend is that Hanuman lived here in a cave and guarded the Janambhoomi, or Ramkot. The main temple contains the statue of Maa Anjani with Bal Hanuman seated on her lap. The faithful believe wishes are granted with a visit to the shrine. Kanak Bhawan is a temple said to have been given to [[Sita]] and Rama by Rama's stepmother [[Kaikeyi]] as a wedding gift, and only contains statues of Sita with her husband.\n\n=== Ramkot ===\nRamkot is the main place of worship in Ayodhya, and the site of the ancient citadel of its namesake, standing on elevated ground in the western city. Although visited by pilgrims throughout the year, it attracts devotees from all over the world on \"[[Ram Navami]]\", the day of the birth of Rama. Ram Navami is celebrated with great pomp in the Hindu month of [[Chaitra]], which falls between March and April. Swarg Dwar is believed to be the site of cremation of Rama. Mani Parbat and Sugriv Parbat are ancient earth mounds, the first identified by a stupa built by the emperor [[Ashoka]], and the second is an ancient monastery. Treta ke Thakur is a temple standing at the site of the [[Ashwamedha|Ashvamedha Yajnya]] of Rama. Three centuries prior, the Raja of Kulu built a new temple here, which was improved by [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] of Indore in 1784, the same time the adjacent Ghats were built. The initial idols in black sandstone were recovered from Sarayu and placed in the new temple, which was known as Kaleram-ka-Mandir. Chhoti Devkali Mandir is the temple of goddess Ishani, or Durga, Kuldevi of Sita.\n\n=== Nageshwarnath Temple ===\nThe temple of Nageshwarnath was established by [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], son of Rama. Legend has it that Kush lost his armlet while bathing in the [[Sarayu]], and it was retrieved by a Nag-Kanya who fell in love with him. As she was a devotee of Shiva, Kush built her this temple. It was the only temple to survive when Ayodhya was abandoned until the time of [[Vikramaditya]]. While the rest of city was in ruin and covered by dense forest, this temple allowed Vikramaditya to recognise the city. The festival of [[Shivratri]] is celebrated here with great splendor.\n\n=== Other places of interest ===\n* Darbarji Durgakali temple\n* Angad Tila\n* Shri Rama Janaki Birla Temple\n* Tulsi Smarak Bhawan\n* Ram ki Paidi\n* Kaleramji ka Mandir\n* Datuvan Kund\n* Janki Mahal\n* Gurudwara Brahma Kund\n* Rishabhadeo Jain Temple\n* Brahma Kund\n* Amawan Temple\n* Tulsi Chaura\n* Laxman Quila\n* Ram Katha Museum\n* Valmiki Ramayan Bhawan\n* Mandir Sunder Sadan\n* Kalhareshwar Mahadev Temple at Darbarji Durga Kali\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Idols of Prabhu Shri Rama and Sita Mata, Kanak Bhavan, Ayodhya, Faizabad, U.P., India.JPG|Kanak Bhavan Temple dedicated to Rama and his consort [[Sita]] is in the centre of Ayodhya.\nFile:Ayodhya city.jpg|Ayodhya Ghaat on the bank [[Ghaghara]] river\nFile:Saryu.JPG|Ghaghra river, locally known as Saryu, at Faizabad.\nFile:Hanuman Garih Temple, Ayodhya, Faizabad (U.P.), India.JPG|Hanuman Garhi temple.

Today, these groups form the majority (about 60%) of Assam's population and are identified as the [[Bodo-Kachari people]] scattered all over Assam; the [[Monpa people|Monpa]] and [[Sherdukpen people]]s of [[Bhutan]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]; the [[Mishing people|Mishings]], and [[Karbi people|Karbis]] of Central [[Assam]].\n\n===Proto-historic and ancient===\n{{further|Indo-Aryan migration to Assam}}\nThe third major ingress into Assam are attributed to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from [[North India]] (Wave 3) into the Brahmaputra Valley mostly after the 3rd century AD Varman rule. This signalled the dawn of the proto-historic period and this immigration continued into the ancient and Medieval periods. These were the group of Dravidian Nadiyals came during Kamarupa. At the end of the ancient period (c1205), the first Muslims (Wave 4), captive soldiers of the defeated Bakhtiar Khilji, settled in the Hajo area.\n\n===Medieval===\nThe next major immigrants were the [[Ahom people|Tai-Ahoms]] (Wave 5) when [[Sukaphaa]] lead his group into Assam via the [[Pangsau Pass]] in the [[Patkai]] from South China. The [[Tai-Ahoms]] were followed by other [[Tai peoples]] who were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (Wave 6): [[Khamti people|Khamti]], [[Khamyang people|Khamyang]], Aiton, [[Tai Phake people|Tai Phake]] and [[Turung people]]s, who settled in Upper Assam and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This continued well into the colonial times.  At the end of the Medieval period, a small contingent of [[Sikhs]] gave rise to a minuscule but prominent group.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/assamese-sikhs-in-search-of-their-roots/433763/ Assamese Sikhs in search of their roots], ''Indian Express Newspaper, 13 March 2009.''</ref>\n\n===Colonial and post-independence===\nIn the beginning of the [[British Raj|colonial period]] in Assam after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] (1826), the political instability led to the immigration of [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Kuki people]] (Wave 7) into the region across the Patkai and Arakan Yoma. They constitute the [[Singpho people|Singphos]] in Upper Assam, and the Kuki-Chin tribes in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The beginning of tea plantations in Assam (1835) by the British led to the immigration of Mundari speaking people (Wave 8) ([[Munda people|Munda]], [[Santal]], [[Savara people|Savara]], [[Oraon]], [[Gondi people|Gond]] etc. tribes). The British administration in Assam also encouraged immigration of a large influx of service holders and professionals from [[Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Nepal]], etc. (Wave 9). To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal.

Today, these groups form the majority (about 60%) of Assam's population and are identified as the [[Bodo-Kachari people]] scattered all over Assam; the [[Monpa people|Monpa]] and [[Sherdukpen people]]s of [[Bhutan]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]; the [[Mishing people|Mishings]], and [[Karbi people|Karbis]] of Central [[Assam]].\n\n===Proto-historic and ancient===\n{{further|Indo-Aryan migration to Assam}}\nThe third major ingress into Assam are attributed to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from [[North India]] (Wave 3) into the Brahmaputra Valley mostly after the 3rd century AD Varman rule. This signalled the dawn of the proto-historic period and this immigration continued into the ancient and Medieval periods. These were the group of Dravidian Nadiyals came during Kamarupa. At the end of the ancient period (c1205), the first Muslims (Wave 4), captive soldiers of the defeated Bakhtiar Khilji, settled in the Hajo area.\n\n===Medieval===\nThe next major immigrants were the [[Ahom people|Tai-Ahoms]] (Wave 5) when [[Sukaphaa]] lead his group into Assam via the [[Pangsau Pass]] in the [[Patkai]] from South China. The [[Tai-Ahoms]] were followed by other [[Tai peoples]] who were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (Wave 6): [[Khamti people|Khamti]], [[Khamyang people|Khamyang]], Aiton, [[Tai Phake people|Tai Phake]] and [[Turung people]]s, who settled in Upper Assam and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. This continued well into the colonial times.  At the end of the Medieval period, a small contingent of [[Sikhs]] gave rise to a minuscule but prominent group.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/assamese-sikhs-in-search-of-their-roots/433763/ Assamese Sikhs in search of their roots], ''Indian Express Newspaper, 13 March 2009.''</ref>\n\n===Colonial and post-independence===\nIn the beginning of the [[British Raj|colonial period]] in Assam after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] (1826), the political instability led to the immigration of [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Kuki people]] (Wave 7) into the region across the Patkai and Arakan Yoma. They constitute the [[Singpho people|Singphos]] in Upper Assam, and the Kuki-Chin tribes in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao. The beginning of tea plantations in Assam (1835) by the British led to the immigration of Mundari speaking people (Wave 8) ([[Munda people|Munda]], [[Santal]], [[Savara people|Savara]], [[Oraon]], [[Gondi people|Gond]] etc. tribes). The British administration in Assam also encouraged immigration of a large influx of service holders and professionals from [[Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Nepal]], etc. (Wave 9). To increase land productivity, the British encouraged [[Bengali Muslims|Muslim]] peasants from [[Mymensingh]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] (Wave 10) to settle in Assam that began in 1901. The last major group to immigrate are the [[Bengali Hindu]] refugees, especially from the [[Sylhet]] district of Bangladesh following the [[Partition of India]] (Wave 11).\n\nInputs from these and other smaller groups have gone towards the building of a unique multi-ethnic socio-cultural situation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ A temporal model of Peopling of Assam based on ethnolinguistic groups (the numbers in brackets indicate \"waves\" as described in the text)\n|-\n!

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Actually, more than 70-75% or more of the now considered non-tribal population of Assam actually have Mongoloid roots and origin and thus were historically tribal. Some of the tribal groups were able to enter into the Hindu upper caste society while some of them remained in the tribal or lower caste society. Thus, Assam has always been a historically tribal state.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|Sanskritisation and Detribalisation in early Assam|2008|pp=116}}</ref>\n\nAhoms along with [[Chutia people|Chutia]], Moran, Motok, and Koch are still regarded as semi-tribal groups who have nominally converted to Ekasarana Dharma even though keeping alive their own tribal traditions and customs.
