{"title_page": "Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2018}}\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Lord Warden Cinque Ports (Lord Boyce).svg|thumb|right|250px|border|Flag of the present Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Admiral [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Lord Boyce]]]]\n\nThe '''Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports''' is a ceremonial official in the [[United Kingdom]]. The post dates from at least the 12th century, when the title was [[Keeper of the Coast]], but may be older. The Lord Warden was originally in charge of the [[Cinque Ports]], a group of five (''cinque'' in [[Norman French]]) port towns on the southeast coast of England that was formed to collectively supply ships for [[The Crown]] in the absence at the time of a formal [[Royal Navy|navy]]. Today the role is a [[sinecure]] and an [[Title of honor|honorary title]], and fourteen towns belong to the Cinque Ports confederation. The title is one of the higher honours bestowed by the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]]; it has often been held by members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] or [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]], especially those who have been influential in defending Britain at times of war.\n\nThe Lord Warden was solely responsible for the return of all writs to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James's church, near [[Dover Castle]], and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]]. He also had a \"lieutenant's powers of [[Muster (military)|muster]]\", and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added (1267) to the warden's office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the clerk and the lieutenant of the castle.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Cinque Ports first appeared in 1305, second amongst the earliest English known [[Heraldry|heraldic]] emblems, predating even the coat of arms of the City of London. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports displays three ships' hulls and three lions [[Wikt:passant|passant]] [[Wikt:gardant|guardant]] conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. These may originally have been ''[[Gules]] three lions passant gardant in pale [[Wikt:gold|Or]]'' (for England) dimidiating ''Gules three ships' hulks in pale Or''. The coat of arms of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports is set out on a red and blue background and traditionally represents the fourteen \"corporate\" members.\n\n==Creation and appointment of the Lord Warden==\nThe creation and appointment of the Lord Warden, once among the most powerful appointments of the realm, by the Sovereign was instituted principally after the portsmen sided with the [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] against [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], in the [[Second Barons' War]], and was intended to provide some central authority over the Cinque Ports, which were essentially otherwise independent of the King's sheriffs. It was combined from 1267 with the office of '''Constable of Dover Castle'''. However, from 1708 [[Walmer Castle]] at Deal was to be preferred as the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden also holds the office of '''Admiral of the Cinque Ports''' with a maritime jurisdiction extending to the middle of the English Channel, from Redcliffe near Seaford, in [[Sussex]] to the shore underneath the Naze Tower, encompassing Brightlingsea in [[Essex]],<ref>Cinque Ports Act 1821. c76 (Regnal 1 & 2 Geo IV) Sect. 18 Boundaries & Jurisdiction of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</ref> the only Cinque Port north of the Thames. In earlier centuries the northern limit was taken as the Shoe Beacon in Essex. \n\nThe courts of Brodhull and Guestling were established to protect the privileges of the Cinque Ports by the portsmen themselves. From the 15th century these courts had been largely replaced by the Lord Warden's Court at Dover. From the 16th century the principal business of the courts was the installation of the Lord Warden and the court is now only occasionally summoned. The office continued to be a powerful one. In 1550 the Mayor and Jurats of Dover refused to accept a Royal Writ because it was not accompanied by a letter of attendance from the Lord Warden. The member ports' parliamentary representatives were appointed by the Lord Warden at first; this influence continued until the 19th century. \n\nAt the installation of a new Lord Warden, the Speaker of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports instructs the Lord Warden: \"to undertake the duties of the Ancient and Honourable Office and to uphold the Franchises, Liberties, Customs and Usages of the port.\" \n\nThe office of Speaker has traditionally rotated between the affiliate townships every year dating from at least 1550. Inaugurations are begun on 21 May, and membership is ordained through a longstanding maritime tradition of a principle of the prevailing winds coming from west to east.\n\nA unique uniform is specified for the Lord Warden (though the present incumbent wears his [[Royal Navy uniform|naval uniform]] in preference). The uniform is very similar to a pre-1956-pattern Admiral's uniform (complete with [[cocked hat]]) trimmed in red and with Cinque Ports insignia.<ref>''Dress and Insignia worn at HM Court'', Lord Chamberlain's Office, 1937</ref> [[Sir Robert Menzies]]'s uniform ([http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-139313837/view pictured]), which he wore as Lord Warden from 1966 to 1978, is preserved at the [[National Library of Australia]].\n\n==Barons of the Cinque Ports==\nAll freemen of the ports, termed \"portsmen\", were deemed in the age of [[feudalism]] to be [[baron]]s, and thus members of the [[baronage]] entitled to attend the king's [[Parliament of England|parliament]].{{fact|date=October 2019}} Termed \"Barons of the Cinque Ports\", they reflected an early concept that military service at sea constituted land tenure ''per baroniam'' making them ''quasi'' [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]]s. The early 14th-century treatise ''[[Modus Tenendi Parliamentum]]'' stated the Barons of the Cinque Ports to hold a place of precedence below the lay magnates but above the representatives of the [[shire]]s and [[borough]]s. [[Writ]]s of summons to Parliament were sent to the warden following which representative barons of the Cinque Ports were selected to attend parliament. Thus the warden's duty in this respect was similar to that of the [[sheriff]] who received the writs for distribution to the barons in the [[shire]]s. The warden and barons often experienced clashes of jurisdiction.<ref>Roskell, J.S. [[History of Parliament]], House of Commons 1386-1421, Stroud, 1992, vol.1, p.751, Cinque Ports</ref> In the 21st century the title \"Baron of the Cinque Ports\" is now reserved for Freemen elected by the Mayor, Jurats, and Common Council of the Ports to attend a Coronation, and is solely honorary in nature.\n\n==List of Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports==\nThe first authoritative list of Cinque Ports Confederation Members was produced in 1293 when Stephen of Pencester was Warden. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is appointed for life, but in the earliest of records this was not the case. The office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports has been traced from the year 1226 from the appointment of William de Averanch, although he was not the first incumbent of this office. The longest term of office was that of William Brook, Lord Cobham, who presided at the court for 40 years.\n\n===Constable of Dover Castle===\nSource:

(Lord Boyce).svg|thumb|right|250px|border|Flag of the present Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Admiral [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Lord Boyce]]]]\n\nThe '''Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports''' is a ceremonial official in the [[United Kingdom]]. The post dates from at least the 12th century, when the title was [[Keeper of the Coast]], but may be older. The Lord Warden was originally in charge of the [[Cinque Ports]], a group of five (''cinque'' in [[Norman French]]) port towns on the southeast coast of England that was formed to collectively supply ships for [[The Crown]] in the absence at the time of a formal [[Royal Navy|navy]]. Today the role is a [[sinecure]] and an [[Title of honor|honorary title]], and fourteen towns belong to the Cinque Ports confederation. The title is one of the higher honours bestowed by the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]]; it has often been held by members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] or [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]], especially those who have been influential in defending Britain at times of war.\n\nThe Lord Warden was solely responsible for the return of all writs to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James's church, near [[Dover Castle]], and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]]. He also had a \"lieutenant's powers of [[Muster (military)|muster]]\", and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added (1267) to the warden's office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the clerk and the lieutenant of the castle.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Cinque Ports first appeared in 1305, second amongst the earliest English known [[Heraldry|heraldic]] emblems, predating even the coat of arms of the City of London. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports displays three ships' hulls and three lions [[Wikt:passant|passant]] [[Wikt:gardant|guardant]] conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. These may originally have been ''[[Gules]] three lions passant gardant in pale [[Wikt:gold|Or]]'' (for England) dimidiating ''Gules three ships' hulks in pale Or''. The coat of arms of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports is set out on a red and blue background and traditionally represents the fourteen \"corporate\" members.\n\n==Creation and appointment of the Lord Warden==\nThe creation and appointment of the Lord Warden, once among the most powerful appointments of the realm, by the Sovereign was instituted principally after the portsmen sided with the [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] against [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], in the [[Second Barons' War]], and was intended to provide some central authority over the Cinque Ports, which were essentially otherwise independent of the King's sheriffs. It was combined from 1267 with the office of '''Constable of Dover Castle'''. However, from 1708 [[Walmer Castle]] at Deal was to be preferred as the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden also holds the office of '''Admiral of the Cinque Ports''' with a maritime jurisdiction extending to the middle of the English Channel, from Redcliffe near Seaford, in [[Sussex]] to the shore underneath the Naze Tower, encompassing Brightlingsea in [[Essex]],<ref>Cinque Ports Act 1821. c76 (Regnal 1 & 2 Geo IV) Sect. 18 Boundaries & Jurisdiction of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</ref> the only Cinque Port north of the Thames. In earlier centuries the northern limit was taken as the Shoe Beacon in Essex. \n\nThe courts of Brodhull and Guestling were established to protect the privileges of the Cinque Ports by the portsmen themselves. From the 15th century these courts had been largely replaced by the Lord Warden's Court at Dover. From the 16th century the principal business of the courts was the installation of the Lord Warden and the court is now only occasionally summoned. The office continued to be a powerful one. In 1550 the Mayor and Jurats of Dover refused to accept a Royal Writ because it was not accompanied by a letter of attendance from the Lord Warden. The member ports' parliamentary representatives were appointed by the Lord Warden at first; this influence continued until the 19th century. \n\nAt the installation of a new Lord Warden, the Speaker of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports instructs the Lord Warden: \"to undertake the duties of the Ancient and Honourable Office and to uphold the Franchises, Liberties, Customs and Usages of the port.\" \n\nThe office of Speaker has traditionally rotated between the affiliate townships every year dating from at least 1550. Inaugurations are begun on 21 May, and membership is ordained through a longstanding maritime tradition of a principle of the prevailing winds coming from west to east.\n\nA unique uniform is specified for the Lord Warden (though the present incumbent wears his [[Royal Navy uniform|naval uniform]] in preference). The uniform is very similar to a pre-1956-pattern Admiral's uniform (complete with [[cocked hat]]) trimmed in red and with Cinque Ports insignia.<ref>''Dress and Insignia worn at HM Court'', Lord Chamberlain's Office, 1937</ref> [[Sir Robert Menzies]]'s uniform ([http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-139313837/view pictured]), which he wore as Lord Warden from 1966 to 1978, is preserved at the [[National Library of Australia]].\n\n==Barons of the Cinque Ports==\nAll freemen of the ports, termed \"portsmen\", were deemed in the age of [[feudalism]] to be [[baron]]s, and thus members of the [[baronage]] entitled to attend the king's [[Parliament of England|parliament]].{{fact|date=October 2019}} Termed \"Barons of the Cinque Ports\", they reflected an early concept that military service at sea constituted land tenure ''per baroniam'' making them ''quasi'' [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]]s. The early 14th-century treatise ''[[Modus Tenendi Parliamentum]]'' stated the Barons of the Cinque Ports to hold a place of precedence below the lay magnates but above the representatives of the [[shire]]s and [[borough]]s. [[Writ]]s of summons to Parliament were sent to the warden following which representative barons of the Cinque Ports were selected to attend parliament. Thus the warden's duty in this respect was similar to that of the [[sheriff]] who received the writs for distribution to the barons in the [[shire]]s. The warden and barons often experienced clashes of jurisdiction.<ref>Roskell, J.S. [[History of Parliament]], House of Commons 1386-1421, Stroud, 1992, vol.1, p.751, Cinque Ports</ref> In the 21st century the title \"Baron of the Cinque Ports\" is now reserved for Freemen elected by the Mayor, Jurats, and Common Council of the Ports to attend a Coronation, and is solely honorary in nature.\n\n==List of Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports==\nThe first authoritative list of Cinque Ports Confederation Members was produced in 1293 when Stephen of Pencester was Warden. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is appointed for life, but in the earliest of records this was not the case. The office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports has been traced from the year 1226 from the appointment of William de Averanch, although he was not the first incumbent of this office. The longest term of office was that of William Brook, Lord Cobham, who presided at the court for 40 years.\n\n===Constable of Dover Castle===\nSource:

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European theater of operations.\" The Group was first formed in December, 1943 and deactivated in December, 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Briquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was there that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Briquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using pontoons to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] recognized that the Treadway bridge was an essential piece of equipment to the campaign, easy to transport, quickly installed, and capable of sustaining heavy military loads.<ref name=\"Crusade in Europe\">{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Crusade in Europe |date=2 July 1997 |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=080185668X |page=380 |edition=1948 First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944]]\n\nOn August 17, 1944, the 1139th meet stiff resistance as they were trying to enter Chartres, France, requiring the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to take on their infantry role. They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreaux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot foot-bridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944 the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.  The bridge building units worked under constant heavy mortar and artillery fire at these crossings, but were aided by the 161st Chemical Smoke Generating Company laying down a heavy smoke screen from hundreds of smoke generators and pots.  The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]]. In spite of the pressure of the continued rapid advance of the Group, morale among the troops remained at a high level.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rapid bridge-launching vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rapid bridge-launching vehicle, designed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group.]]\n\n[[File:730 foot Heavy Ponton Bridge built at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, Nov 17 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heavy Ponton Bridge built across the Moselle River at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, November 17, 1944]]\n\nDuring the month of October, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group grew to one of the largest tactical engineer groups in the United States Army.  Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.  (While functional, this vehicle was unfortunately found to be so heavy that it was not practical to move for any real distance).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cattennom France bridge lost under fire November 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cattennom, France, bridge lost under fire, November 1944]]\n\nThe month of November, 1944, was of extreme importance to the XX Corps because the crossing of the Moselle River and advancement eastward depended upon the success by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group in bridging the River.<ref name='=\"Headquarters Unit History, November 1\u201330, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; November 1-30, 1944 |date=January 4, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>  A total of eight bridges were constructed across the Moselle River by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group during the month; two Treadway M2s of 350 and 396 feet in length, one 630 foot Treadway M1, two Floating Baileys of 530 and 440 feet in length, one Baily DS, and two Heavy Ponton bridges of 730 and 675 feet in length.  These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most of these crossings the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to assist in overcoming the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was also necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December, 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.  On December 6, 1944,  the 90th Infantry Division, located near Wallerfangen, France, was ready to make the assault crossing. The 20th Engineer Combat Battalion commenced ferrying operations in [[Assault boat|Assault and storm boats]].  They ferried across two Battalions and part of a 3rd battalion of the 38th Infantry Regiment, while the 179th Engineer Combat Battalion ferried the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 357th Infantry Regiment.  Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no let up in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.  However, the incoming fire was so heavy that power boats could not be brought down to the river for launching.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1\u201331, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, December 1 - 31, 1944 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, a ferry was constructed on December 8, 1944 for ferrying vehicles, anti-tank guns and tanks across the river at Wallerfangen, with additional ferries at Pachten-Dillingen and Rehlingen-Siersburg, France, which made it possible to ferry all the vehicles and tanks of the 90th Infantry as rapidly as they were needed to secure a beachhead on the eastern shore.  This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When General Patton learned of the attack he quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, road blocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.  The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion installed a 240-foot Treadway bridge at Taben, Germany, and a 286' Heavy Ponton Bridge at Saarburg, Germany, and the 993rd Engineers Treadway Bridge Company built a 320-foot Treadway Bridge at Serrig, allowing the 94th Infantry Division to cross the Saar River and established a vital bridgehead at Serrig, Germany.  This, in turn, allowed a 286-foot Heavy Ponton bridge and a 336-foot Treadway bridge to be built across the Sarr at Niederleuken and Schoden, Germany, so that both Infantry and Armor could cross and reduce the enemy on the eastern side of the Saar.  On March 6, 1945, an additional 336-foot Treadway M2 C1 bridge was then established at Konz Karthaus, Germany by the 179th and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.\n\nDuring the first part of March 1945, the 1139th Group was engaged in engineering work necessary for the rapid advancement of the XX Corps from the Saar to the Rhine Rivers.  In addition to construction of numerous Bailey Bridges and small fixed bridges, they were tasked with supervising civilian labor on road work, preparing gun emplacements for artillery pieces, constructing camouflage screens and anti-mine booms at bridges, removing dead animals from minefields, hauling prisoners, demolishing buildings to widen roads, painting town signs, and destroying enemy tanks and artillery pieces.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History March 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; March 1 - 31, 1945 |date=May 26, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonel Jackson and Colonel Niles at Rhine River Mainz, Germany, April 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Colonel Jackson (CO 160th) and Colonel Niles (CO 1139th) at Rhine River, Mainz, Germany, April 1945]]\n\nIn quick secession the American Armies were converging on the enemy in the Rhine-Moselle triangle; the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] from the North, the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th]] and [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th]] Armored Divisions from the South, and the [[United States Army Central|3rd]] and the [[Seventh United States Army|7th]] Armies from various locations.

Extensive studies were made by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to determine the best site for crossing.  Study of all available maps and photos determined that the downtown area of Mainz, Germany, was the best site, even though the Rhine was wider at that point.  Profiles were prepared for the entire area, indicating which terrain areas had to be captured or neutralized by artillery fire, and hydraulic data and river bed materials were studied to understand the types and sizes of anchors necessary for the bridge.  Finally site reconnaissance at the river's edge by Group personnel determined the exact location for the bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, March 1 - 31, 1945 |page=2}}</ref>  This crossing required two assault operations lead by the 80th Infantry Division with support from the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion.<ref name=\"Builders and Fighters\">{{cite book |last1=Fowle |first1=Barry W. |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |date=22 March 2005 |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |location=Fort Belvoir, Virginia |isbn=9781410221773 |page=470 |edition=First Edition Revised 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe first infantry crossing (using assault boats) incurred a high causality rate, so the two battalions were then crossed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported Navel units.  Once the infantry was ashore, ferrying operations were carried on by Navy operated boats, using 6 [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] and 6 [[LCVP (United States)|Higgens Boats]].  During the launching there was heavy artillery fire, 20mm and small arms fire on the site, knocking out a bulldozer and killing a naval officer.  However the 997th Engineer Treadway Company with assistance from the 160th Engineer Combat Battalion was able to construct a Treadway M2 Bridge across the Rhine 1,896 feet long; ''the Longest Tactical Bridge built in the European theater of operations''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |page=471}}</ref><ref>The 1370 foot long ponton bridge built by the [[107th Engineer Battalion]] was the longest tactical floating bridge as of March 22, 1945.</ref>  This bridge served the entire XX Corps in crossing the Rhine, and marked the end of assault phase of the Rhein in the Third Army area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=113.

On March 31, 1945 the Third Army started it's run towards Berlin, from Mainz, Germany, traveling north-east through Frankfurt to Friedberg, to Alsfeld, then, crossing the Fulda River with a 312-foot Treadway M2 Bridge, on to Reichensachen, Germany.  Then traveling eastward they next bridged the Werra River and traveled to Langensalza, Germany, and after bridging the Helme River on April 11, 1945, they traveled along the [[Autobahn]] for two days constructing Bailey Bridges where needed to repair sections of the highway that had been destroyed by allied bombardment.  While traveling the Autobahn, they came across an area where the median strip had been paved as a landing airstrip and painted green, and on it sat an unusual looking plane with no propeller.  It turned out to be one of the German Jet planes that had been abandoned during the rapid retreat of the German Army.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Michael, SSGT, 1139th Engineer Combat Group |title=Personal Interview, July, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VE Day Passing out Champagne to 1139th troops.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops celebrating VE Day with Champagne, near Lambach, Austria, May 8, 1945]]\n\nThe 1139th stopped in Weimar, Germany on April 13, 1945.  Here they were situated in the most luxurious barracks that they had stayed in; formerly used by German Anti-aircraft troops.  However, it was also here that they saw their most horrible of all sights; the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald Concentration Camp]].  The Third Army had liberated the camp just two days earlier.  At the urging of General Patton, many of the 1139th troops visited the camp and saw the walking skeletons, stacks of withered corpses, and incompletely burned bodies, pits of lime covered bodies, and all saw emaciated inmates from the camp walking along the road towards Weimer, and heard firsthand accounts about the horrors from a former Captain of the Dutch army, who was taken in from the camp to act as an interpreter.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=26}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 1945, the Third army continued moving eastward until it arrived just outside of Chemnitz, Germany.

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European theater of operations.\" The Group was first formed in December, 1943 and deactivated in December, 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S. Niles, with Colonel Walton H. Walker as the Executive Officer.\n\nOn July 1, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, consisting of 16 officers and 66 enlisted men,<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, August 5\u201331, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; August 5-31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives. 1139th Engineer Combat Group |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref> left [[Camp Shanks]] by train to the [[New York Port of Embarkation]] and began loading on to the [[USAT Thomas H. Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Briquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was there that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S.

(The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Briquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.

They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreaux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot foot-bridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.

When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944 the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.

Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most cases the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to assist in overcoming the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December, 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.

Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no let up in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.

This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When he learned of the attack, General Patton quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, road blocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.

On May 4, 1945, the 1139th constructed a 560-foot Heavy Ponton Bridge over the Inn River at Passau, Germany, and the next day they left Ortenburg, Germany and moved southeastward to Lambach, Austria, where contact was made with the Russian forces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History 1 April 45 to 8 May 45 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThis was the furthest they traveled in search for the National Redoubt by the Germany Army. It was here, on May 7, 1945, that the troops heard that finally Germany would officially surrender the next day.  The same day General Walton H. Walker, commander of the XX Corps, received the unconditional surrender of Generaloberst [[Lothar Rendulic]], commander of German Army Group South.<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-71st-divisions-cavalry-reconnaissance-troop-find-the-german-army-group-south.htm 71st Division Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop find the German Army Group South]</ref>\n\nThe 1139th constructed a 516-foot Treadway M2 Bridge across the Isar River at Plattling, Austria, and on May 9, 1945, they constructed their final bridge, a 755-foot Heavy Ponton Bridge over the Inn River at Schaerding, Austria.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=36}}</ref>  On May 10, 1945, the 1139th left Lambach, Austria and began their return home moving northeastward to Ried im Innkreis, Austria.\n\n== The 1139th as part of the Army of Occupation in Germany ==\n\nAfter [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], the 1139th was involved in assisting the German people rebuild their state as part of the U.S. Army of Occupation in Germany.\n\nInitially the 1139th Engineer Combat Group expected to be broken up following [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], with some of the troops destined for the Pacific, while others moved to fill in personnel gaps in other units.\n\n[[File:Victoria Mine Saarland Germany June 1945.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Victoria Mine; Saarland, Germany, during preparations for operation, June 1945]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops on the way home.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops on the way home on a Kaiser Victory Ship.]]\n\nHowever, General Eisenhower felt that rehabilitation of the Ruhr area in Germany was vital to rebuilding the German economy, because nowhere else in Europe were there coal deposits of that quality and ease of access.  This coal was key to allowing Germany to rebuild its industries and in turn to feed its own population.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=442}}</ref>\n\nColonel Niles and the 1139th Engineer Combat Group were given this duty. The 1139th was assigned to get the Bavarian and Saar coal mines back in operation.  This included clearing and preparing the mine sites for return to operations, and because there were few returning coal miners, the 1139th's Engineers were also required to providing training and education to the surviving populous on running the mine.  The 1139th worked on the mine projects for many months.  During these activities the 1139th was experiencing a slow reduction in troop size as the GIs with 45 VE Day points or more were discharged and returned home to the states.<ref name=\"Interview\" />\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group was disbanded in December, 1946, with the last of the troops returning to the states.\n\n= Tables and Documents =\n\n== Table 1: Divisions and Regiments that were supported by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group ==\n{|class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

It was one of the first European battles won by gunpowder weapons, as the assault by Swiss pikemen and French cavalry was shattered by the fire of Spanish arquebusiers behind a ditch.\n\n==Preparations==\nThe [[Second Italian War]] was re-kindled in late 1502, over disagreements on the Treaty of Granada of 11 November 1500. Although it was agreed that Louis XII should assume the [[Kingdom of Naples|throne of Naples]], Louis and the monarchs of Spain soon quarreled over the division of the rest of the spoils.  Soon war broke out again between France and Spain.<ref>Michael Mallett and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494\u20131559'', p. 61.</ref> \nThe Spanish forces, led by the \"Great Captain\" (''El Gran Capit\u00e1n'')  [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] avoided encounter with the enemy at first, hoping to lure the French into complacency.\nAfter a series of skirmishes, the Battle of Cerignola was the first major engagement in this phase of the war, alongside the [[Battle of Seminara (1503)|Battle of Seminara]] (Calabria) fought on the same day.\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba  had the numerical disadvantage but held the advantage of the terrain, being able to defend fortified high ground against the French assault. \nThe Spanish had occupied the heights of Cerignola, and de C\u00f3rdoba entrenched his soldiers with walls and stakes.\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's infantry was divided into a novel type of units called \"Coronel\u00edas,\" the immediate predecessor of the later [[Tercios]]. They were armed with a mix of pikes, arquebuses and swords. This type of formation had revolutionized the Spanish army, which like the French, had  centred on cavalry well into the 15th century, in the battles of the [[Reconquista]] against the Muslims in Spain.  \nIn front of the hillside, a trench was dug in which the arquebusiers took their positions. The Spanish artillery was placed on top of the hill among the vineyards, having a good view of the entire battlefield. The [[jinetes]], Spanish light cavalry, were placed in front of the rest of the army, while the Spanish heavy cavalry under Prospero Colonna were kept in reserve.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wojny w\u0142oskie 1494-1559 |last=Tafi\u0142owski |first=Piotr |year=2007 |publisher=Inforeditions |location=Zabrze |isbn=978-83-89943-18-7}}</ref>\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's troops faced a professional French army based on the ''Ordonnance'' reforms, relying on the heavily armoured cavalry of the ''Compagnies d'ordonnance'' and mercenary Swiss pikemen.

The next assault tried to force the right flank, but many of the French cavalrymen fell into the Spanish trench and the attack was then broken by a storm of fire from the Spanish arquebusiers. One of those killed by the arquebus volley was the French commander [[Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]], making him probably the first general killed in action by small arms fire.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} . With the Swiss commander, Chandieu, taking charge, the Swiss infantry attacked with the cavalry instead of waiting for the arrival of the French rear guard under Yves d'Al\u00e8gre. At the imminent assault upon the Spanish center the Spanish arquebusiers were withdrawn and the [[Landsknecht]]s sent forward. The Swiss formations, soon joined by the Gascons, were unable to break into the defensive positions. Shot into the flank by the arquebusiers and harassed by the Spanish cavalry, the Swiss and French were driven back, taking heavy casualties including Chandieu.\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba then called for a counterattack against the now disorganized enemy by both the Spanish infantry and the heavy Spanish cavalry waiting in reserve. Mounted arquebusiers surrounded and routed the remaining French gendarmes, but the Swiss pikeman managed to retreat in a relatively organized fashion.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wojny w\u0142oskie 1494-1559 |last=Tafi\u0142owski |first=Piotr |year=2007 |publisher=Inforeditions |location=Zabrze |isbn=978-83-89943-18-7}}</ref>\n\nUpon witnessing the defeat of both the gendarmes and the pikemen, d'Al\u00e8gre called for a withdrawal.
