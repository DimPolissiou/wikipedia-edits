Smith joined the [[National Museum of Natural History|National Museum in Washington]] in 1886 as an assistant curator of insects. Along with C.V. Riley, Smith helped in standardizing the sizes of the insect cabinet boxes with his father, and these boxes continue to be known as \"''Schmitt boxes.''\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gurney|first=A.

Smith took a special interest in the Noctuidae, proposing as many as 995 species.  He was appointed State Entomologist of New Jersey in 1894 until his death. He edited ''Entomological Americana'' from 1882 to 1890 and published several books including the ''Glossary of Entomology'', ''Economic Entomology'' (1896), ''Monograph of the Noctuidae of Boreal America'', and ''Our Insect Friends and Enemies'' (1909).

Dyar published his own \u201cA List of North American Lepidoptera\u201d as a counter to Smith's list. Dyar clashed on matters of taxonomy, mostly on nomenclatural priority, with [[Charles Valentine Riley|C.V. Riley]], [[Augustus Radcliffe Grote|A.R. Grote]], and [[Herman Strecker|H. Strecker]] among others. The dispute with Smith began with criticisms over Smith's checklist of 1892. In 1903 Smith named a moth as ''Euclidia dyari'', which though appearing like an honor, was a name to replace another that the two had argued over. Dyar likewise created ''Protorthodes smithii'' in 1904. Smith took exception to Dyar's criticism of Rev. [[George Duryea Hulst|Hulst]] on identifications and nomenclature. Hulst had recently passed away and had bequeathed his specimens to the Rutgers collection and Smith refused to lend these to the US National Museum collection overseen by Dyar. Smith even wrote to Dyar \"''If you object that I am allowing personal consideration to retard scientific knowledge I will plead guilty''.\" After a fire in Rutgers in 1903 Dyar wrote a letter that placing specimens in the Washington collection would be a safeguard. Again Smith refused, with a copy to [[Leland Ossian Howard|L.O. Howard]]. After Smith began to work in mosquitoes in 1901, there appeared to be a thaw in relations with Dyar helping in some identifications. When Dyar sought some larval specimens, Smith again refused to loan them and it again led to a downward spiral in their relations. In 1909 he clashed with Dyar again over credit on the discovery of the breeding habits of mosquitoes in Dublin, New Jersey. With Smith's death the battled died out but the rivalry became legend among insect taxonomists with embellished (incorrect) versions stating that Smith created the genus ''[[Dyaria]]'' (pun on Diarrhoea) to spite the latter.

The tank was manufactured in Germany and assembled on site, and is unique in being assembled using rivets rather than welds. It is believed{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} to be the only one of its kind with a spherical shape (it is rumored{{weasel-word|date=October 2017}} that there was another similar water ball in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] that was destroyed during the [[Second World War]]). Traditionally, locals tell visitors that it is filled with [[cajeta]], taking them to visit the \"Bola del Agua\" on Sundays, the traditional day for visiting the Independencia Lane. A plaque at the base of the water tower features the legend (in Spanish):\n\n{{Cita|'''\"This tower was built at the expense of the city municipality in 1910 and officially opened on 15 September, the day of the anniversary of the proclamation of the independence of Mexico as a state governor Mr. Don Joaqu\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Obreg\u00f3n, who gave full moral support to the construction.'s work and everything related to the provision of drinking water, was designed and conducted by the district political head Mr. Don Perfecto I. Aranda, its total cost, including piping limited to two circuits, was $ 161,520.84 '' (mexican old)  '' pesos \".''}}\n\nThe work was carried out under the command of German Enrique Sch\u00f6ndube, although it is known that payment for the construction took ten years due to the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], so it was paid once the new government established. During the Mexican Revolution, Villa's officers thought the hydraulic tower had such a large amount of water that destroying it would drown the population of Celaya. One of Villa's generals ordered his artillery to destroy it. Captain Gustavo Duron, in charge of a 75mm battery, followed the orders but shot around the tower, avoiding it and protecting the monument, as mentioned by local historian Herminio Mart\u00ednez. The construction resulted in the neglect of the people handing out water at home from the mayor's office called water carriers. Commercial advertising on its surface was allowed for several years to cover the costs of the reservoir, ending on September 8, 1980 when, in celebration of upcoming 410th Anniversary of the Foundation of Celaya, the mayor in charge decreed that the Ball of Water would be a symbol that would represent the city, and the placement of advertisements was banned.\n\n===Cuisine===\nCelaya is also famous for the artisanal production of [[cajeta]], a type of milk candy.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe [[Celaya Airport]] has (as of January 22, 2007) commercial flights to [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro]] and connections from there to other destinations.  Celaya lies along the El Paso Spur of the [[Pan-American Highway]] which is known locally as [[Mexican Federal Highway 45]].\n\n==People from Celaya==\n* [[Christian Tumalan]] (b.  ), Band Leader of Grammy award-winning Pacific Mambo Orchestra; classical pianist.\n* [[Marta Sahag\u00fan de Fox]] (b.

The tank was manufactured in Germany and assembled on site, and is unique in being assembled using rivets rather than welds. It is believed{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} to be the only one of its kind with a spherical shape (it is rumored{{weasel-word|date=October 2017}} that there was another similar water ball in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] that was destroyed during the [[Second World War]]). Traditionally, locals tell visitors that it is filled with [[cajeta]], taking them to visit the \"Bola del Agua\" on Sundays, the traditional day for visiting the Independencia Lane. A plaque at the base of the water tower features the legend (in Spanish):\n\n{{Cita|'''\"This tower was built at the expense of the city municipality in 1910 and officially opened on 15 September, the day of the anniversary of the proclamation of the independence of Mexico as a state governor Mr. Don Joaqu\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Obreg\u00f3n, who gave full moral support to the construction.'s work and everything related to the provision of drinking water, was designed and conducted by the district political head Mr. Don Perfecto I. Aranda, its total cost, including piping limited to two circuits, was $ 161,520.84 '' (mexican old)  '' pesos \".''}}\n\nThe work was carried out under the command of German Enrique Sch\u00f6ndube, although it is known that payment for the construction took ten years due to the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], so it was paid once the new government established. During the Mexican Revolution, Villa's officers thought the hydraulic tower had such a large amount of water that destroying it would drown the population of Celaya. One of Villa's generals ordered his artillery to destroy it. Captain Gustavo Duron, in charge of a 75mm battery, followed the orders but shot around the tower, avoiding it and protecting the monument, as mentioned by local historian Herminio Mart\u00ednez. The construction resulted in the neglect of the people handing out water at home from the mayor's office called water carriers. Commercial advertising on its surface was allowed for several years to cover the costs of the reservoir, ending on September 8, 1980 when, in celebration of upcoming 410th Anniversary of the Foundation of Celaya, the mayor in charge decreed that the Ball of Water would be a symbol that would represent the city, and the placement of advertisements was banned.\n\n===Cuisine===\nCelaya is also famous for the artisanal production of [[cajeta]], a type of milk candy.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe [[Celaya Airport]] has (as of January 22, 2007) commercial flights to [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro]] and connections from there to other destinations.  Celaya lies along the El Paso Spur of the [[Pan-American Highway]] which is known locally as [[Mexican Federal Highway 45]].\n\n==People from Celaya==\n* [[Christian Tumalan]] (b.  ), Band Leader of Grammy award winning Pacific Mambo Orchestra; classical pianist.\n* [[Marta Sahag\u00fan de Fox]] (b.

The frog character is a plain green triangle.\n\nThe production team consists of around 16 in-house animators, with six to eight scriptwriters.<ref name=\"cartoonbrewinterview\" />\n\n== Format ==\nEvery episode stars with a showcase of what one of the Squirrel Club mmbers are doing at their houses. Then, the narrator Alexander interrupts them saying that it's time for Duggee's Squirrel Club. He would usually remind them by saying \"(character name), isn't it time for?...\", before the Squirrels gasps and yells \"Duggee!!!\". Then they stop what they were doing, run out of their houses, get into their parents' vehicles and head to Duggee's school clubhouse. Alexander calls Duggee's name \"DUGGEE!!!\", which Duggee rolls out of the school and replies with a \"Woof!\", then does a quick dance as everyone arrives. When the camera zooms out and the Squirrels arrive at Duggee's class, other characters from the show can be briefly seen. Then the Squirrels hug their parents and run off to Duggee where the series' logo is shown. Afterwards, it will cut to a scene with the episode title card as the narrator reads it out loud. He usually reads it as \"Hey Duggee and The (insert noun here) Badge\". However, the episode's normal titles are just the aforementioned last three words of the narrator's line.\n\nAfter the title card and a brief instrumental of the theme song is played, it cuts to the Squirrels doing their normal activities. The narrator greets them and is wondering what Duggee has planned for them in the episode. The Squirrels run off to where Duggee is doing something related to the episode and shout out \"Hey Duggee! What are you doing?\". and Duggee gives them a quick demonstration of what's happening later in the episode's plot. Whenever the narrator says that Duggee has one of the badges that are literally the title of the episodes, Duggee would point to the said badge on his shirt and the camera would zoom in onto it.\n\nIn each episode, a situation will present itself that can be solved by learning a new skill. When the skill has been learned, and the situation resolved, the Squirrels receive one of Duggee's badges. After their parents have arrived to pick the students up, the narrator states \"Just time for one more thing\". Each episode ends with a \"Duggee Hug\", where all the children hug Duggee at once. They then return to their parents with the badge they have earned.\n\nThe final scene of the episodes is the narrator saying \"Well that was fun, wasn't it Duggee?\", before Duggee realizes something strange related to the episode's topic going on behind him, but usually laughs it off and in some episodes the narrator might say to Duggee \"Do stop it, Duggee\" by telling him to stop laughing. Then the end credits roll.\n\nThe voice of the narrator is provided by English entertainer [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]]. The narrator frequently talks to Duggee and the children.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Felperin |first1=Leslie |title=Hey Duggee at the Cinema! review \u2013 CBeebies earns its movie badge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/18/hey-duggee-at-the-cinema-review-cbeebies-preschool |accessdate=15 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* Narrator (Alexander Armstrong) - A male narrator is typically common for storytelling of the episode's plots.\n* Duggee (Sander Jones) \u2013 A brown dog who is the protagonist of the series.

To date, eight of these have existed.\n\nThese include:\n* The Big Badge App\n* The Big Outdoors App\n* We Love Animals\n* Colo(u)ring\n* Jigsaw Puzzles\n* The Counting Badge\n* The Exploring App\n* The Squirrels Club\n\n== Curiosities ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n* Betty is considered the most intelligent character of Hey Duggee. Among the various abilities involving her intelligence, she is fluent in [[Chinese Language|Chinese]], as shown in the episode \"The Spider Badge\" (Given that Betty and her friends are of school age, it is possible that she has a super high [[i.q.]]). She also proves to be an [[environmental activist]] in the episode The Maze Badge (in it she says that several objects could be reused by someone, she tells Tag twice not to call it rubbish.\n* Hey Duggee addresses topics previously considered taboo in children's shows such as [[Homosexuality]] (in the figure of the couple of crabs John Crab and Nigel) and themes involving several types of family (In the figure of Happy, the crocodile, one of the protagonists of the series, one of the Squirrels and that is [[adopted]] and is adoptive son of elephant parents).\n* This series has several characters that came from [[foreign national|other countries]], such as Hedgley who has an [[African-American]] accent and who (possibly) came from the [[United States of America]] or [[Canada]] ('''Note''': The African-American Accent or [[African-American Vernacular English]] is spoken by both [[African-Americans]] and [[Black Canadians]], so it is possible that he is American or [[Canadian]] and has come from the [[United States of America]] or [[Canada]]), Lord Fingal of Skye Castle, who is [[Scottish people|Scottish]] one of the Rabbits, who is French and come from [[France]]. These characters in question are the representation of [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom]].\n* In the original development of the show, the central character was going to be called 'Chop Chop' rather than Duggee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designing-duggee#|title=Exhibition at the Design Museum, London}}</ref>\n* There were originally going to be six members of the squirrel club instead of five - the sixth character can still be seen as the bus driver who brings Happy and his mother to squirrel club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designing-duggee#|title=Exhibition at the Design Museum, London}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n* [https://www.heyduggee.com Hey Duggee] \u2013 The Official Website of Hey Duggee\n* ''[http://www.studioaka.co.uk/OurWork/heyduggee Hey Duggee]'' at [[Studio AKA]]\n* ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291050/ Hey Duggee]'' at [[IMDb|Internet Movie Database]]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:2014 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2020s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:British preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:British animated television programmes featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Nick Jr. original programming]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British pre-school television series}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Hey Duggee\n| image                    = Hey Duggee Logo.png\n| image_size               = 270px\n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = \n| genre                    = \n| creator                  = [[Grant Orchard]]\n| developer                = \n| writer                   = \n| screenplay               = \n| story                    = \n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = Sander Jones\n| starring                 = Alexander Armstrong<br />Sander Jones\n| voices                   = Jasmine Bartholomew<br />Poppie Boyes<br />Duke Davis<br />Bella Green<br />Sander Jones<br />Alfie Sanderson<br />Leo Templer<br />Dexter Varrall <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| narrated                 = [[Alexander Armstrong]]\n| theme_music_composer     = Oliver M.A. Knowles\n| opentheme                = Isn't It Time for Duggee?\n| endtheme                 = Hey Duggee Theme (instrumental)\n| composer                 = Tin Sounds\n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_series               = 3<!-- Increment when new series begin.

The children take part in all kinds of activities, have adventures and earn badges for their accomplishments.\n\n''Hey Duggee'' is airing its third series. It was first shown in December 2014.

The frog character is a plain green triangle.\n\nThe production team consists of around 16 in-house animators, with six to eight scriptwriters.<ref name=\"cartoonbrewinterview\" />\n\n== Format ==\nEvery episode stars with a showcase of what one of the Squirrel Club mmbers are doing at their houses. Then, the narrator Alexander interrupts them saying that it's time for Duggee's Squirrel Club. He would usually remind them by saying \"(character name), isn't it time for?...\", before the Squirrels gasps and yells \"Duggee!!!\". Then they stop what they were doing, run out of their houses, get into their parents' vehicles and head to Duggee's school clubhouse. Alexander calls Duggee's name \"DUGGEE!!!\", which Duggee rolls out of the school and replies with a \"Woof!\", then does a quick dance as everyone arrives. When the camera zooms out and the Squirrels arrive at Duggee's class, other characters from the show can be briefly seen. Then the Squirrels hug their parents and run off to Duggee where the series' logo is shown. Afterwards, it will cut to a scene with the episode title card as the narrator reads it out loud. He usually reads it as \"Hey Duggee and The (insert noun here) Badge\". However, the episode's normal titles are just the aforementioned last three words of the narrator's line.\n\nAfter the title card and a brief instrumental of the theme song is played, it cuts to the Squirrels doing their normal activities. The narrator greets them and is wondering what Duggee has planned for them in the episode. The Squirrels run off to where Duggee is doing something related to the episode and shout out \"Hey Duggee! What are you doing?\". and Duggee gives them a quick demonstration of what's happening later in the episode's plot. Whenever the narrator says that Duggee has one of the badges that are literally the title of the episodes, Duggee would point to the said badge on his shirt and the camera would zoom in onto it.\n\nIn each episode, a situation will present itself that can be solved by learning a new skill. When the skill has been learned, and the situation resolved, the Squirrels receive one of Duggee's badges. After their parents have arrived to pick the students up, the narrator states \"Just time for one more thing\". Each episode ends with a \"Duggee Hug\", where all the children hug Duggee at once. They then return to their parents with the badge they have earned.\n\nThe final scene of the episodes is the narrator saying \"Well that was fun, wasn't it Duggee?\", before Duggee realizes something strange related to the episode's topic going on behind him, but usually laughs it off and in some episodes the narrator might say to Duggee \"Do stop it, Duggee\" by telling him to stop laughing. Then the end credits roll.\n\nThe voice of the narrator is provided by English entertainer [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]]. The narrator frequently talks to Duggee and the children.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Felperin |first1=Leslie |title=Hey Duggee at the Cinema! review \u2013 CBeebies earns its movie badge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/18/hey-duggee-at-the-cinema-review-cbeebies-preschool |accessdate=15 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* Narrator (Alexander Armstrong) - A male narrator is typically common for storytelling of the episode's plots.\n* Duggee (Sander Jones) \u2013 A brown dog who is the protagonist of the series.

Among the various abilities involving her intelligence, she is fluent in [[Chinese Language|Chinese]], as shown in the episode \"The Spider Badge\" (Given that Betty and her friends are of school age, it is possible that she has a super high [[i.q.]]). She also proves to be an [[environmental activist]] in the episode The Maze Badge (in it she says that several objects could be reused by someone, she tells Tag twice not to call it rubbish.\n* Hey Duggee addresses topics previously considered taboo in children's shows such as [[Homosexuality]] (in the figure of the couple of crabs John Crab and Nigel) and themes involving several types of family (In the figure of Happy, the crocodile, one of the protagonists of the series, one of the Squirrels and that is [[adopted]] and is adoptive son of elephant parents).\n* This series has several characters that came from [[foreign national|other countries]], such as Hedgley who has an [[African-American]] accent and who (possibly) came from the [[United States of America]] or [[Canada]] ('''Note''': The African-American Accent or [[African-American Vernacular English]] is spoken by both [[African-Americans]] and [[Black Canadians]], so it is possible that he is American or [[Canadian]] and has come from the [[United States of America]] or [[Canada]]), Lord Fingal of Skye Castle, who is [[Scottish people|Scottish]] one of the Rabbits, who is French and come from [[France]]. These characters in question are the representation of [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom]].\n* In the original development of the show, the central character was going to be called 'Chop Chop' rather than Duggee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designing-duggee#|title=Exhibition at the Design Museum, London}}</ref>\n* There were originally going to be six members of the squirrel club instead of five - the sixth character can still be seen as the bus driver who brings Happy and his mother to squirrel club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designing-duggee#|title=Exhibition at the Design Museum, London}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n* [https://www.heyduggee.com Hey Duggee] \u2013 The Official Website of Hey Duggee\n* ''[http://www.studioaka.co.uk/OurWork/heyduggee Hey Duggee]'' at [[Studio AKA]]\n* ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291050/ Hey Duggee]'' at [[IMDb|Internet Movie Database]]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:2014 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2020s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:British preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:British animated television programmes featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Nick Jr. original programming]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n", "name_user": "202.93.153.246", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSeries 1 (2014\u20132015))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Duggee"}

According to local legend, the water rights to [[Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia|Big Spring]] were won for the white settlers by a local white boy in a footrace with a Cherokee youth. Some versions of the legend differ, saying that the rights to the spring were won by the Cherokee people from the Creek people in a ball game. \"Big Strickland\" became \"Cedar Town\" when Prior deeded ten acres of adjacent land to the newly chartered city in 1852. Big Strickland was the original county seat and Cedar Town became the county seat later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cedartown's historic [[Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia|Big Spring]] provides water to 10,000 people.]]\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Cedar Town was abandoned by most of its citizens when [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops encroached. The city was burnt to the ground by the Union forces of General [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]] in 1865, leaving only one [[mill (factory)|mill]] standing on the outskirts of town.\n\nIn 1867, the town was re-chartered by the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as '''Cedartown'''. An influx of industrial business bolstered its largely cotton-based economy, with Goodyear and other fabric mills and iron works appearing in or near what is now the Cedartown Industrial Park on the west side of town.\n\nIndustrial and passenger [[rail transport|railroad]] service was added to Cedartown in the early 20th century. Main St. became a part of [[U.S. Route 27]], a major north\u2013south automobile route that connects Cedartown to larger cities like [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and [[Columbus, Georgia]]. U.S. 27 also intersects in town with [[U.S. Route 278]], which connects Cedartown with [[Atlanta]].\n\nThe [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] built a large [[textile]] mill operation in Cedartown, and also built a large residential section of town for mill workers, now known as the Goodyear Village.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn recent times, the Georgia Rails to Trails project has converted much of the former Seaboard Air Line into the [[Silver Comet Trail]], a federal and state funded park that connects many cities in northwest Georgia. The former Seaboard Air Line, now CSXT, tracks are still in place and used between Rockmart and Cedartown, to serve rail customers in both cities, connecting with the former L&N line in Cartersville, Ga on a former SAL branchline, that now serves a Georgia Power plant with Wyoming coal.\n\nCedartown's Main Street is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in recognition of its 1890s architecture. During the 1970s, many structures were demolished, including train stations, churches, and a high school, and a theater on Main Street.\n\nOn December 30, 2016 a 12 year old named Katelyn Nicole Davis known online by the username ITZ Dolly, hanged herself from a tree in her back yard while live streaming the event to Live.me after she claimed being neglected by her biological father alongside being physically and sexually abused by her stepfather, the video caused widespread outrage.<ref name=\"NYDaily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/police-sexual-abuse-claim-made-online-suicide-article-1.2944491|title=Georgia police investigating sexual abuse claims made during preteen girl\u2019s online suicide &nbsp; - NY Daily News|first=Jessica|last=Schladebeck|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, the Polk County Comprehensive Plan outlined investments to be made in the repair and construction of new sidewalks, street parks, and paving in Cedartown over the next decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Polk County Joint Comprehensive Plan|url=http://www.nwgrc.org/wp-content/uploads/Polk-County-Joint-Comprehensive-Plan-2017-2027.pdf|website=Northwest Georgia Regional Commission|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\n*Cedartown Performing Arts Center\n*Cedartown Museum of Coca-Cola Memorabilia\n\nSites on the National Register of Historic Places:\n* Cedartown Commercial Historic District\n* Cedartown Waterworks-Women's Building-Big Spring Park Historic District\n* [[Hawkes Children's Library (Cedartown, Georgia)|Hawkes Children's Library]]\n* Northwest Cedartown Historic District\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 323\n|1880= 843\n|1890= 1625\n|1900= 2823\n|1910= 3551\n|1920= 4053\n|1930= 8124\n|1940= 9025\n|1950= 9470\n|1960= 9340\n|1970= 9253\n|1980= 8619\n|1990= 7978\n|2000= 9470\n|2010= 9750\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10215\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,470 people, 3,370 households, and 2,237 families residing in the city.

The city suffered a major economic blow when the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] closed its local [[mill (factory)|mill]] operations. For its employment, Cedartown mainly relies on the prospect of large [[corporation|corporate operation centers]] such as [[Cingular Wireless]], [[manufacturing]] operations like that of [[The HON Company]], and the [[retail]] operations of [[Wal-Mart]].\n\nThe Hon Company is Cedartown's largest for-profit employer with over 800 employees.

The non-motorized, paved trail is intended for walkers, hikers, bicyclists, rollerbladers, horses, dog walkers, and is wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe Silver Comet Trail is 61.5 miles long, and starts at the Mavell Road Trailhead in Smyrna, Georgia. It ends at the Georgia/Alabama state line, near Cedartown and The Esom Hill Trailhead.\n\nAt the Georgia/Alabama state line, the Silver Comet connects to the 33-mile long Chief Ladiga Trail. Plans are underway to extend the Chief Ladiga an additional 7 miles. Both the Silver Comet Trail and Chief Ladiga are fully paved rail-trails built on abandoned railroad lines. The combined Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga trail length is estimated to be 94.5 paved miles from Smyrna, Georgia to Anniston, Alabama.\n\nPeeks Park is a beautiful city park located in Cedartown, Georgia.

According to local legend, the water rights to [[Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia|Big Spring]] were won for the white settlers by a local white boy in a footrace with a Cherokee youth. Some versions of the legend differ, saying that the rights to the spring were won by the Cherokee people from the Creek people in a ball game. \"Big Strickland\" became \"Cedar Town\" when Prior deeded ten acres of adjacent land to the newly chartered city in 1852. Big Strickland was the original county seat and Cedar Town became the county seat later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cedartown's historic [[Big Spring Park, Cedartown, Georgia|Big Spring]] provides water to 10,000 people.]]\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Cedar Town was abandoned by most of its citizens when [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops encroached. The city was burnt to the ground by the Union forces of General [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]] in 1865, leaving only one [[mill (factory)|mill]] standing on the outskirts of town.\n\nIn 1867, the town was re-chartered by the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as '''Cedartown'''. An influx of industrial business bolstered its largely cotton-based economy, with Goodyear and other fabric mills and iron works appearing in or near what is now the Cedartown Industrial Park on the west side of town.\n\nIndustrial and passenger [[rail transport|railroad]] service was added to Cedartown in the early 20th century. Main St. became a part of [[U.S. Route 27]], a major north-south automobile route that connects Cedartown to larger cities like [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and [[Columbus, Georgia]]. U.S. 27 also intersects in town with [[U.S. Route 278]], which connects Cedartown with [[Atlanta]].\n\nThe [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] built a large [[textile]] mill operation in Cedartown, and also built a large residential section of town for mill workers, now known as the Goodyear Village.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn recent times, the Georgia Rails to Trails project has converted much of the former Seaboard Air Line into the [[Silver Comet Trail]], a federal and state funded park that connects many cities in northwest Georgia. The former Seaboard Air Line, now CSXT, tracks are still in place and used between Rockmart and Cedartown, to serve rail customers in both cities, connecting with the former L&N line in Cartersville, Ga on a former SAL branchline, that now serves a Georgia Power plant with Wyoming coal.\n\nCedartown's Main Street is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in recognition of its 1890s architecture.

A paleo-American archaeological site (named the Wilson-Leonard site) was discovered in Cedar Park in 1983 that showed evidence of continual habitation of the area since circa 5000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century the community was known as Running Brushy, named after a spring that formed the headwaters of a creek of the same name. In 1873 George and Harriet Cluck, after having run cattle up the [[Chisholm Trail]] for many years, bought {{convert|329|acre|km2}} of land that included the Running Brushy spring. Their ranch formed the core of the community that would one day become Cedar Park.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=hgc05 | name=Cedar Park}}</ref>\n\nTen years later, the railroad came through. The [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]], which connected the state capitol with the cities of [[Burnet, Texas|Burnet]] and [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]] to the north, was finished in 1882 and passed through Running Brushy and the Cluck ranch. The community was at this point renamed Bruggerhoff, after a railroad company official. However, the name was generally disliked by locals, being both hard to spell and pronounce. In 1887, Emmett Cluck (son of George and Harriet) changed the community name to Cedar Park. In 1892, a \"strolling park\" of {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} was built near the train depot. Austinites would ride the train to Cedar Park for day trips to the park.<ref>{{cite web | title=History of Cedar Park-Leander | url=http://www.cedarpark360.com/historyofcedarparkleander.html | accessdate=2008-12-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129080403/http://www.cedarpark360.com/historyofcedarparkleander.html | archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nCedar Park changed little until the 1950s and 1960s when housing subdivisions began to be built, spurred by the growth of nearby Austin. On February 24, 1973, the citizens of Cedar Park voted to incorporate. The estimated population was 1,765. A library followed in 1978.\n\nOn May 27, 1997, a strong and destructive F3 tornado struck the town. The tornado was one of 20 confirmed tornadoes that occurred during the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|1997 Central Texas Tornado outbreak]]. It devastated the downtown area of the city, killing one person and nearly destroying the Albertson's grocery store.\n\nMajor retailers began finding their way to the city in 2002 as Walmart opened. Additional large retailers now include Super Target, multiple HEB grocery stores, Academy Sports and Outdoors, Whole Foods, Randalls, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Costco. The major shopping centers include 1890 Ranch, Cedar Park Town Center, The Parke, and the  Cypress Creek Shopping Center.

The Center is located at the corner of New Hope Drive and [[183A Toll Road]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century, the Cedar Park area was inhabited by Native American tribes including the [[Tonkawa]], the [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]], and the [[Comanche]]. A paleo-American archaeological site (named the Wilson-Leonard site) was discovered in Cedar Park in 1983 that showed evidence of continual habitation of the area since circa 5000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century the community was known as Running Brushy, named after a spring that formed the headwaters of a creek of the same name. In 1873 George and Harriet Cluck, after having run cattle up the [[Chisholm Trail]] for many years, bought {{convert|329|acre|km2}} of land that included the Running Brushy spring. Their ranch formed the core of the community that would one day become Cedar Park.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=hgc05 | name=Cedar Park}}</ref>\n\nTen years later, the railroad came through. The [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]], which connected the state capitol with the cities of [[Burnet, Texas|Burnet]] and [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]] to the north, was finished in 1882 and passed through Running Brushy and the Cluck ranch. The community was at this point renamed Bruggerhoff, after a railroad company official. However, the name was generally disliked by locals, being both hard to spell and pronounce. In 1887, Emmett Cluck (son of George and Harriet) changed the community name to Cedar Park. In 1892, a \"strolling park\" of {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} was built near the train depot. Austinites would ride the train to Cedar Park for day trips to the park.<ref>{{cite web | title=History of Cedar Park-Leander | url=http://www.cedarpark360.com/historyofcedarparkleander.html | accessdate=2008-12-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129080403/http://www.cedarpark360.com/historyofcedarparkleander.html | archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nCedar Park changed little until the 1950s and 1960s when housing subdivisions began to be built, spurred by the growth of nearby Austin. On February 24, 1973, the citizens of Cedar Park voted to incorporate. The estimated population was 1,765. A library followed in 1978.\n\nOn May 27, 1997, a strong and destructive F3 tornado struck the town. The tornado was one of 20 confirmed tornadoes that occurred during the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|1997 Central Texas Tornado outbreak]]. It devastated the downtown area of the city, killing one person and nearly destroying the Albertson's grocery store.\n\nMajor retailers began finding their way to the city in 2002 as Walmart opened. Additional large retailers now include Super Target, multiple HEB grocery stores, Academy Sports and Outdoors, Whole Foods, Randalls, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Costco. The major shopping centers include 1890 Ranch, Cedar Park Town Center, The Parke, and the  Cypress Creek Shopping Center. In December 2007, Cedar Park Regional Medical Center opened becoming the first major medical center in Cedar Park.\n\nIn 2013, the US Census Bureau named Cedar Park the 4th fastest growing city in the United States, with a population of 57,957.\n\nOn April 4, 2016 the city announced it was collecting submissions for designs for an official city flag.
