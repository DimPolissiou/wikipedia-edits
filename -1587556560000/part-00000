In 1999, Jericho and Ward met in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] after a wrestling show and Jericho was invited to play with the band. Their first show was held at the now-defunct club \"The Hangar\", in the downtown square of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]. Jericho sat in on a few sessions, but did not plan to play with them permanently. In 2000, Jericho rejoined the band and became its front man under the persona of Moongoose McQueen, and the band went on tour. As part of the band's \"gimmick\", Jericho refused to acknowledge that Moongoose McQueen and Chris Jericho were the same person. When interviewed as Moongoose, he would stay in character the whole time and even feign ignorance of who Chris Jericho was. On the other side, Chris Jericho was a \"huge fan\" of Moongoose and Fozzy.\n\n[[File:Fozzy logo.svg|thumb|alt=Fozzy logo wordmark|upright|Fozzy logo wordmark]]\n\n===Self-titled debut and ''Happenstance'' (2000\u20132002)===\nThe band shortened its name to Fozzy, and adopted the satirical back-story that they had signed with a record company to move to Japan to be huge rock stars, but the company went out of business, leaving them stranded for 20 years, while all their demos were snatched and recorded by other bands.<ref name=\"j2011_p62\">{{harvnb|Jericho|2011|p=62}}</ref> Soon afterward, Fozzy produced their first album, [[Fozzy (album)|self-titled]] and featuring mostly covers of bands such as [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Judas Priest]].<ref name=\"j2011_p62\"/> Also, at one time the band considered changing their name to Big City Knights.<ref name=\"j2011_p62\"/>\n\nFozzy's second album, ''[[Happenstance (Fozzy album)|Happenstance]]'', was produced in 2002, again with mostly covers of bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[W.A.S.P.

Jericho has characterized the band by saying, \"If [[Metallica]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]] had a bastard child, it would be Fozzy.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFNLEW4mEgE&t=7m Chris Jericho Interview]. Wrestling Voice Radio. November 27, 2012. Retrieved February 14, 2013.</ref> As of October 2017, the band has released seven studio albums and one live album.\n\nTheir first two albums consist of primarily cover songs with some original material, while their albums since have made original material the primary focus.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation (1999\u20132000)===\nFozzy started as Fozzy Osbourne, a play on the name of the singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and was a [[cover band]] assembled by Ward from whatever musicians he could find in a given week. In 1999, Jericho and Ward met in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] after a wrestling show and Jericho was invited to play with the band. Their first show was held at the now-defunct club \"The Hangar\", in the downtown square of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]. Jericho sat in on a few sessions, but did not plan to play with them permanently. In 2000, Jericho rejoined the band and became its front man under the persona of Moongoose McQueen, and the band went on tour. As part of the band's \"gimmick\", Jericho refused to acknowledge that Moongoose McQueen and Chris Jericho were the same person. When interviewed as Moongoose, he would stay in character the whole time and even feign ignorance of who Chris Jericho was. On the other side, Chris Jericho was a \"huge fan\" of Moongoose and Fozzy.\n\n[[File:Fozzy logo.svg|thumb|alt=Fozzy logo wordmark|upright|Fozzy logo wordmark]]\n\n===Self-titled debut and ''Happenstance'' (2000\u20132002)===\nThe band shortened its name to Fozzy, and adopted the satirical back-story that they had signed with a record company to move to Japan to be huge rock stars, but the company went out of business, leaving them stranded for 20 years, while all their demos were snatched and recorded by other bands.<ref name=\"j2011_p62\">{{harvnb|Jericho|2011|p=62}}</ref> Soon afterward, Fozzy produced their first album, [[Fozzy (album)|self-titled]] and featuring mostly covers of bands such as [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Judas Priest]].<ref name=\"j2011_p62\"/> Also, at one time the band considered changing their name to Big City Knights.<ref name=\"j2011_p62\"/>\n\nFozzy's second album, ''[[Happenstance (Fozzy album)|Happenstance]]'', was produced in 2002, again with mostly covers of bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]].\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Fozzy - Enemy.ogg\n|title=\"Enemy\" by Fozzy (2005)\n|description=21 second sample from Fozzy's \"[[Enemy (Fozzy song)|Enemy]]\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n===''All That Remains'' (2003\u20132006)===\nAfter the Happenstance tour ended in 2003, the band dropped its back-story and Chris Jericho's McQueen persona.<ref>{{harvnb|Jericho|2011|p=270}} - \"So we dropped the covers, the storyline, the pseudonyms, and the wigs.\"</ref> In January 2005, they released their third album, ''[[All That Remains (album)|All That Remains]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Jericho|2011|p=273}} - \"So we released our third album, ''All That Remains'', in January 2005 on Ash Records.\"</ref> which had entirely original tracks, including the singles \"[[Enemy (Fozzy song)|Enemy]]\", \"It's A Lie\", \"Born Of Anger\", and \"The Test\".
