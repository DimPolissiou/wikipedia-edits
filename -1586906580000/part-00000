By sulfonation of the resulting oil (or purified fractions thereof), and subsequent neutralization with ammonia, Ichthammol results as a viscous, water-soluble substance with a characteristic bitumen-like odor. It is used in [[medicine]] (sometimes in combination with [[zinc oxide]]) as a treatment for different [[skin diseases]], including [[eczema]] and [[psoriasis]] (see below). [[Ointment]]s containing 10% or 20% Ichthammol are most common. They are sometimes called \"black ointments\" or \"drawing salves\". Ichthammol's dermatological action was promoted by German physician [[Paul Gerson Unna]].<ref>Paul Gerson Unna: About Ichthyol.

Baumann, C. Schotten: \u00dcber das Ichthyol.

It is a thick reddish brown liquid, possessing a bituminous odor and taste. It is soluble in water and miscible with [[glycerin]], but is nearly insoluble in strong alcohol or concentrated ether. It contains a large percentage of organically combined [[sulfur]].\n\n==Differentiation from Chinese Materials==\nMaterials made in China (Pinyin transcription: yushizhi and yushizhi ruangao) and offered outside China as Ichthammol or Ammonium Bituminosulfonate do not meet the requirements for this substance in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) or European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur). Also, there is no conformity with the definition as connected to CAS# 8029-68-3. The Chinese material is derived from vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil) instead of bituminous schists as required (Chinese definition according to ChP 10: \"Ichthammol is a mixture obtained by sulfuration of vegetable oils (soybean oil, tung oil, corn oil, etc.), sulfonation, and neutralization with ammonia\").<ref>People's Republic of China Pharmacopoeia, 2010 edition.</ref> As a result, its chemical basis is totally different from the one of Ichthammol USP/Ph.Eur./CAS# 8029-68-3. The characteristic bitumen-like odor (originating from the bituminous source material) is missing with Chinese material and, thereby, the original qualities according to common standards cannot be identified without doubt.

She was born and raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]] and spent most of her youth working with producer Anthony Dent as a songwriter and [[backing vocalist|background vocalist]] for several [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists. By the age of 14, Hilson had secured a record deal with the girl group D'Signe, who later disbanded. She attended [[Oxford College of Emory University]] in [[Oxford, Georgia|Georgia]], while she continued writing songs for artists, including [[Britney Spears]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]], and [[Mary J. Blige]], with the production and songwriting team [[The Clutch]]. In 2006, Hilson signed with American rapper and producer [[Timbaland]]'s record label [[Mosley Music Group|Mosley Music]]. Her breakthrough came in 2007 after appearing on Timbaland's single \"[[The Way I Are]]\", which topped [[Record chart|charts]] around the world.\n\nHilson's music style is R&B, hip hop,  and [[Pop music|pop]]; womanhood, sexual intimacy and love are the typical themes. Her musical influences come from her father's side of the family. Hilson's debut studio album, ''[[In a Perfect World...]]'', was released in 2009, and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, eventually being [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album spawned the hit singles \"[[Knock You Down]]\", \"[[Turnin Me On]]\" and \"[[I Like (Keri Hilson song)|I Like]]\". It also earned Hilson two [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] for \"Knock You Down\". Her second studio album, ''[[No Boys Allowed]]'', was released in 2010 and was considerably less successful than its predecessor; however, it included the platinum single \"[[Pretty Girl Rock]]\". In 2016 Hilson announced that her upcoming third studio album would be titled ''L.I.A.R''. The album has yet to be released, and for the past eight years Hilson has not released any new music of her own.\n\nBesides her music career, Hilson has also contributed to various charities and pursued a career in acting, but she continues to record and perform music. She has contributed in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]], helped various relief efforts for natural disasters, and became involved with several educational organizations. In 2012, Hilson made her acting debut in the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Think Like a Man]]''. Her achievements include a [[BET Award]], [[MOBO Award]], [[NAACP Image Award]] and two [[Soul Train Music Awards]].\n\n<ref>https://www.newsweek.com/youtube-video-suggests-5g-internet-causes-coronavirus-people-are-falling-it-1493321</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== 1982\u20132007: Early life and career beginnings ===\nKeri Lynn Hilson was born on December 5, 1982, in [[Decatur, Georgia]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/keri-hilson-p615713/biography |title=Keri Hilson \u2013 Biography|last=Cordor|first=Cyril|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Derrick |url=http://www.essence.com/2011/12/05/happy-29th-birthday-keri-hilson/ |title=Keri Hilson Celebrates Her 29th Birthday |work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]] |publisher=[[Time Inc]] |date=December 5, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/660jIAyBn?url=http://www.essence.com/2011/12/05/happy-29th-birthday-keri-hilson/ |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hilson's mother owns and runs a [[day care]] center and her father was a developer who served in the Army.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=Amir |url=http://rollingout.com/music/john-legend-and-keri-hilson-discuss-the-importance-of-education-at-teach-for-americas-promise-night/ |title=John Legend and Keri Hilson Discuss the Importance of Education at Teach For America's Promise Night |work=Rolling Out |publisher=Steed Media Group, Inc |date=March 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WRgZmqt?url=http://rollingout.com/music/john-legend-and-keri-hilson-discuss-the-importance-of-education-at-teach-for-americas-promise-night/ |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=R.

name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> and actress. She was born and raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]] and spent most of her youth working with producer Anthony Dent as a songwriter and [[backing vocalist|background vocalist]] for several [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists. By the age of 14, Hilson had secured a record deal with the girl group D'Signe, who later disbanded. She attended [[Oxford College of Emory University]] in [[Oxford, Georgia|Georgia]], while she continued writing songs for artists, including [[Britney Spears]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]], and [[Mary J. Blige]], with the production and songwriting team [[The Clutch]]. In 2006, Hilson signed with American rapper and producer [[Timbaland]]'s record label [[Mosley Music Group|Mosley Music]]. Her breakthrough came in 2007 after appearing on Timbaland's single \"[[The Way I Are]]\", which topped [[Record chart|charts]] around the world.\n\nHilson's music style is R&B, hip hop,  and [[Pop music|pop]]; womanhood, sexual intimacy and love are the typical themes. Her musical influences come from her father's side of the family. Hilson's debut studio album, ''[[In a Perfect World...]]'', was released in 2009, and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, eventually being [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album spawned the hit singles \"[[Knock You Down]]\", \"[[Turnin Me On]]\" and \"[[I Like (Keri Hilson song)|I Like]]\". It also earned Hilson two [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] for \"Knock You Down\". Her second studio album, ''[[No Boys Allowed]]'', was released in 2010 and was considerably less successful than its predecessor; however, it included the platinum single \"[[Pretty Girl Rock]]\". In 2016 Hilson announced that her upcoming third studio album would be titled ''L.I.A.R''. The album has yet to be released, and for the past eight years Hilson has not released any new music of her own.\n\nBesides her music career, Hilson has also contributed to various charities and pursued a career in acting, but she continues to record and perform music. She has contributed in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]], helped various relief efforts for natural disasters, and became involved with several educational organizations.
