The Court accepted an assurance to it by the government's lawyers that Johnson would write the required letter. The Court also dismissed a request for an order preventing the government from frustrating the Benn Act, for example by asking another EU member state to veto a requested Brexit extension, after the government's lawyers undertook to the Court that no such action would be taken. There is to be an appeal to the [[Inner House]] of the Court of Session.

Together with the preceding [[Nicaean Empire]] and the contemporary ''[[Frankokratia]]'', this period is known as the '''late Byzantine Empire'''.\n\nFrom the start, the r\u00e9gime faced numerous problems.<ref name=\"Cyril255\">Mango, p. 255</ref> The [[Turkish people|Turks]] of [[Asia Minor]] had since 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. [[Anatolia]], which had formed the very heart of the shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'', whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by [[Islamic]] zeal, the prospect of economic gain, and the desire to seek refuge from the Mongols<ref name=\"John Joseph Saunders\">John Joseph Saunders, pp. 79</ref> after the disastrous [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] in 1243. With a decreasing source of food and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Serbian Empire]], the remnants of the [[Latin Empire]] and even the [[Knights Hospitaller]].\n\nThe loss of land in the east to the Turks and in the west to the Bulgarians was complemented by two disastrous civil wars, the [[Black Death]] and the 1354 earthquake at [[Gallipoli]], whose destruction and evacuation allowed the Turks to occupy it. By 1380, the Byzantine Empire consisted of the capital [[Constantinople]] and a few other isolated exclaves, which only nominally recognized the Emperor as their lord. Nonetheless, Byzantine diplomacy coupled with the adroit exploitation of internal divisions and external threats among their enemies, and above all the invasion of Anatolia by [[Timur]], allowed Byzantium to survive until 1453. The last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Despotate of the Morea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], fell shortly afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Palaiologan period witnessed a renewed flourishing in art and the letters, in what has been called the \"Palaiologian Renaissance\". The [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|migration of Byzantine scholars]] to the West also helped to spark the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Byzantium1215.jpg|thumb|right|400px|After 1204, the Byzantine Empire was partitioned between various successor states, with the Latin Empire in control of Constantinople]]\nFollowing the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantine Empire had fractured into the Greek successor-states of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and Trebizond, with a multitude of Frankish and Latin possessions occupying the remainder, nominally subject to the [[Latin Empire|Latin Emperors]] at Constantinople. In addition, the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire allowed the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], the Serbs and the various Turcoman emirates of Anatolia to make gains. Although Epirus was initially the strongest of the three Greek states, the Nicaeans were the ones who succeeded in taking back the city of Constantinople from the Latin Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril254\">Mango, p. 254</ref>\n\nThe Nicaean Empire was successful in holding its own against its Latin and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] opponents. At the [[Battle of Meander Valley]], a Turkic force was repelled<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> and an earlier assault on Nicaea led to the death of the Seljuk Sultan. In the west, the Latins were unable to expand into Anatolia; consolidating Thrace against Bulgaria was a challenge that kept the Latins occupied for the duration of the Latin Empire.\n\nIn 1261, the Empire of Nicaea was ruled by [[John IV Laskaris]], a boy of ten years.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> However, John IV was overshadowed by his co-emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. Palaiologos was a leading noble of military standing and the main figure of the regency of John IV, who had used this role to propel himself to the throne, and set the stage for his becoming sole Emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire.\n\n==Michael VIII Palaiologos, 1261\u20131282==\n[[File:Hyperpyron-Michael VIII Paleologus-sb2241.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Hyperpyron of Michael VIII]]\n{{main|Michael VIII Palaiologos}}\n\nIn 1261, while the bulk of the Latin Empire's military forces were absent from Constantinople, the Byzantine General [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] used the opportunity to seize the city with 600 troops. [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessalonica]] had already been taken by Nicaea in 1246.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> Following the capture of Constantinople, Michael ordered the blinding of John IV in December 1261, so as to become sole emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> As a result, Patriarch [[Patriarch Arsenius I of Constantinople|Arsenios]] excommunicated Michael, but he was deposed and replaced by [[Patriarch Joseph I of Constantinople|Joseph I]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Restoration of Constantinople===\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] and their successors, the Latin Empire, had done much to reduce Byzantium's finest city to an underpopulated wreck.<ref name=\"Madden110113\">Madden, pp. 110\u2013113</ref> Michael VIII began the task of restoring many monasteries, public buildings and defence works.<ref name=\"Cyril256\">Mango, p. 256</ref> The [[Hagia Sophia]], horribly looted in the Crusade of 1204, was refurbished to Greek Orthodox tradition. The [[Kontoskalion]] harbour and the [[walls of Constantinople]] were all strengthened against a possible new expedition by the Latin West. Many hospitals, hospices, markets, baths, streets and churches were built, some with private patronage. Even a new Mosque was built to compensate for the one burnt during the Fourth Crusade.<ref name=\"Cyril256\"/> These attempts were costly and crippling taxes were placed on the peasantry.<ref name=\"Madden179\">Madden, p. 179</ref> Nonetheless, the city grew new cultural and diplomatic contacts, notably with the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)#Bahri rule|Mamelukes]]. Both had common enemies; Latin aggression, and later on, the Ottoman Turks.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nThe [[Sultanate of Rum]] was in chaos and decentralized ever since the [[Mongol]] invasions in ca. 1240.<ref>Lowe, Steven, and Martin Baker. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027082448/http://geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm \"Seljuks of Rum\".] 21 Feb. 1992. 29 May 2007</ref> As a result, the greatest threat to Byzantium was not the Muslims but their Christian counterparts in the West \u2014 Michael VIII knew that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] would no doubt launch another attempt to establish [[Latin Empire|Latin rule]] in Constantinople. The situation became worse when [[Charles I of Anjou]] conquered [[Sicily]] from the [[Hohenstaufens]] in 1266.<ref name=\"Cyril257\">Mango, p. 257</ref> In 1267, [[Pope Clement IV]] arranged a pact, whereby Charles would receive land in the East in return for assisting a new military expedition to Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril257\"/> A delay on Charles' end meant that Michael VIII was given enough time to negotiate a union between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople in 1274, thus removing papal support for an invasion of Constantinople.\n\nUnfortunately for Michael VIII, the new union was seen as a fake by Clement's successor, [[Martin IV]]. The Greek Church was excommunicated, and Charles was given renewed papal support for the invasion of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril258\">Mango, p. 258</ref> In order to counter this, Michael VIII subsidized [[Peter III of Aragon]]'s attempts to seize Sicily from Charles.  Michael's efforts paid off with the outbreak of the [[Sicilian Vespers]], a revolt that overthrew the Angevin King of Sicily and installed Peter III of Aragon as King of Sicily in 1281.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/>\n\nFor the remainder of his life, Michael campaigned to drive the Latins out of Greece and the Balkans, and secure his position versus the Bulgarians. He was largely successful, regaining several islands in the Aegean, and establishing a foothold in the Peloponnese, that would grow to become the [[Despotate of the Morea]]. The downside however was that Michael's efforts in the West absorbed most of the Empire's manpower and resources, and neglected the Asian provinces, where a new and fateful threat was rising: the beylik of [[Osman I]], who by 1263 had captured [[Sogut]]. Nevertheless, the border was kept relatively secure, and no significant losses occurred in Asia Minor during Michael's reign.\n[[File:1263 Mediterranean Sea.svg|thumb|400px|right|Middle East c. 1263<ref name=\"Madden162\">Madden, p. 162</ref><ref name=\"Grant93\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|page=93}}</ref><ref>Shepherd, William R. \"The Byzantine Empire in 1265.\" Perry\u2013Casta\u00f1eda Library. 1926.

The result was that heavy taxes were levied on the peasantry,<ref name=\"Madden179\"/> something that the Ottomans would later use to their advantage, winning over these poverty-stricken peasants with promises of lower taxes.\n\nThe [[Second Council of Lyons]] and the ostensible union of the two Churches did little to avert Catholic aggression, while at the same time the Orthodox population, led by large parts of the priesthood, denounced Michael VIII as a traitor.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/> His death in 1282 came as a relief to many, and his body was denied an Orthodox funeral, as a result of his policies towards Rome.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nMichael VIII was a very energetic, ambitious and capable emperor who had enlarged and preserved the Empire and had once again made Byzantium a power to be reckoned with in the region. His army, however, was still small, and diplomacy was relied upon more than ever. An extortionate tax system supported his ambitious and successful foreign policies of expansion, as well as his numerous bribes and gifts to various potentates. He had put Byzantium on the road of recovery, but his achievements were still perilously fragile, as events would soon show.\n\n==Andronikos II Palaiologos, 1282\u20131328==\n{{main|Andronikos II Palaiologos}}\n\nAndronikos II was the son of Michael VIII. He ascended the throne in 1282, at the age of 24.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nAndronikos II was tied down with events in the West and the East. The Serbians under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin]] had begun invading the Balkans and took [[Skopje]] in 1282<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and raids against Macedonia were launched throughout the 1290s. Byzantine counter-attacks failed to stop these, and as a result Andronikos was forced to resort to diplomacy, marrying his 5-year-old daughter to the Serbian King<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and ceding a number of forts from [[Ohrid]] to [[\u0160tip|Stip]] to [[Strumica]] as a \"dowry\". Nonetheless, the Serbs continued their expansion.\n\nUnlike his father, Andronikos II recognized the gravity of the situation in Asia Minor,<ref name=\"Cyril260\">Mango, p. 260</ref> and tried to drive out the Turks, utilizing a variety of methods. His first action was to move his court to Asia Minor, where he could better oversee the construction of fortifications and raise troop morale.<ref name=\"Cyril261\">Mango, p. 261</ref> His General, [[Alexios Philanthropenos]], was an able commander, campaigning with some success against the Turks in the Meander Valley. Unfortunately Byzantium was robbed of his services when he staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/> Next Andronikos sent his son, [[Michael IX]], and the Heteriarch [[George Mouzalon]] to attack the Turks who were laying siege to [[Nicomedia]], but they were beaten at the [[Battle of Bapheus]] in 1302.\n\nNot giving up, Andronikos hired the 6,500 strong \"[[Catalan Company]]\" of [[Almogavars]], led by [[Roger de Flor]]. Originating from [[Catalonia]], these hardy mercenaries were used to skirmishing against the [[Moors]] in Spain and now, for an extraordinarily high price, they drove the Turks back in Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/> Once again, these successes were nullified when their leader, Roger de Flor, was assassinated on his way to meet Andronikos; the Catalans then revolted against imperial authority, and began pillaging and raiding cities in Thrace, leaving Asia Minor open to Turkish incursions. After this, Andronikos turned to diplomacy, asking the [[Ilkhanids]] of Persia to send troops to attack the Turks, but negotiations for such an alliance failed.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/>\n\n===Domestic policy===\n[[File:Tornese Andronicus II.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Andronikos II's debasement of the Byzantine currency, along with his co-rule with his father, his son and his grandson as well as his own sole rule, resulted in the minting of several different coins during his reign.]]\nAndronikos II ordered the Union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches to be canceled, a move which pleased many. But he also ordered drastic reductions in the military, and effectively disbanded the navy,<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> which his father had worked hard to build up. As a result, tax reductions throughout the Empire were possible,<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> earning him greater popularity while seriously undermining Byzantium's abilities to deal with its opponents. He debased the ''[[hyperpyron]]'' currency<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and heavily taxed the military elite of the ''[[pronoia]]rioi'', thereby further reducing Byzantium's military capability. While these solved some problems that Michael VIII had left for his son, it unraveled his father's attempts at restoring the power of the Byzantine Empire; where Michael VIII had attempted to deal with problems outside the Empire, Andronikos aimed to solve the internal problems resulting from his father's reign.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Civil War and abdication===\nAndronikos II's policies were not successful in dealing with Byzantium's external problems; however, it would be threats from within the Empire that led to his abdication \u2014 in 1320 Andronikos III, the young (in his twenties) grandson of Andronikos II was disinherited by the Emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril262\">Mango, p. 262</ref> Andronikos III's brother Manuel Palaiologos had been accidentally murdered by Andronikos III's companions over a competitive love affair. His father (Michael IX), the son of Andronikos II, died of shock as a result of his son's death. Andronikos III did not take his disinheritance lightly \u2014 organizing an armed opposition, he succeeded in drawing support with promises of generous tax cuts, even beyond those enacted by Andronikos II.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> Andronikos II was powerless to stop the young usurper; he granted him [[Thrace]] as an [[appanage]] in 1321,<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> the title of co-emperor in 1322,<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> and after a small war where the Bulgarians and Serbians played the two sides against each other, Andronikos II was forced to abdicate and retire as a monk to a monastery, where he died in 1332.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/>\n\nDespite the calamities of the civil war, Andronikos III was about to revitalise the Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> Although Asia Minor was at this point destined to fall to the Turks, it had been in a worse position in 1091 and yet still recovered by Byzantium.\n\n===Legacy===\nAndronikos II attempted to solve Byzantium's internal problems more than his father had. The solutions  he chose however had severe repercussions. They undermined the military and financial basis of the state, and the disasters suffered by his foreign policy failures further worsened the situation. Dissatisfaction from his failure, his old age and a \"reckless grandson\" culminated in his abdication.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/>\n\n==Andronikos III, 1328\u20131341==\n{{main|Andronikos III Palaiologos}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:1328 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|400px|right|Byzantium at the beginning of Andronikos III's reign.]]\nThe rule of Andronikos III is characterized as the last genuine attempt to restore Byzantine fortunes. His attempts came close to fruition, but the many hostile neighbors of Byzantium eventually took their toll on an Empire in decline.\n\nHis first concern was that of Asia Minor. Nicaea, until 1261 the capital of the Empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III launched a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the [[Battle of Pelekanon]] on June 10,<ref name=\"Cyril263\">Mango, p. 263</ref> and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see [[Nicomedia]] or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute \u2014 the Ottomans did not stop at this and seized Nicomedia as well in 1337.\n\nDespite this, Andronikos III scored a few successes in the Aegean: in 1329, Chios was recovered,<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> and in 1335, Andronikos arranged an alliance involving financial indemnities with the Turkic [[Emir]] [[Umur Beg|Bahud-din Umur]], [[Bey]] of [[Aydinids|Aydin]], and was able to recover [[Lesbos]] and [[Phocaea]] from the Latins.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\nIn Europe, Andronikos III had mixed results; Thessaly returned to Imperial rule in 1333, but Serbia once again began expanding southwards: led by the Byzantine renegade [[Syrgiannes Palaiologos]], Serbian forces took five key forts from Byzantium in 1334 and forced it to recognize the new borders.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> Andronikos was then forced to recognize Serbian rule in Macedonia. In addition, Andronikos faced a further reversal when leading his army at Rousokastron where he was defeated by the Bulgarians under their leader Ivan Alexander. Nevertheless, Andronikos was able to bring back Epirus into the fold in 1341 through the use of diplomacy.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> The result was that while the Empire was reduced to its European territories, it had succeeded in bringing much of Greece under its control. Unfortunately for the newly expanded Byzantium, [[Stephen Dusan]] (ruling Serbia from 1331) decided to take these lands as well from Byzantium. The death of Andronikos III and the resulting chaos left the Empire in no position to fight back.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nAlthough ultimately unsuccessful, the reign of Andronikos III was one of the last bright spots in Byzantine history, as the Empire's position was becoming increasingly precarious. Andronikos was able to score some successes in his life as he campaigned vigorously against the Genoese with success and reestablished some control over Epirus and Thessaly. Throughout his reign, he was also able to work with competent administrators such as John Kantakouzenos who, along with many of the nobles supported Andronikos during the civil war with Andronikos II, However, numerous reversals against Byzantium's enemies such as Serbia and the rising Ottomans at battles such as Pelekanon further drained the power Byzantium had in comparison to its neighbors. This would be a situation that would not be helped by his sudden death in the 1340s which resulted in a civil war between the regency of John V(a coalition of Anna of Savoy, Alexios Apokaukos and the patriarch of Constantinople, John XIV) and the nobility who promoted John Kantakouzenos as emperor.<ref>Editors of Britannica, editor. \"Andronicus III Palaeologus\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc., June 11, 2018, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andronicus-III-Palaeologus</ref> In addition, diplomacy became less useful, as Byzantium's enemies realized that the Emperor had not the military or even economic might to back his word. While there was a general decline in the Empire's fortunes, Andronikos III's death would be the ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' for the Empire \u2014 his 10-year-old son was led by a regency that was torn apart in dynastic rivalries which led to the Second Palaiologan Civil War and the recognition of John Kantakouzenos as emperor and a catastrophe from which Byzantium would never recover.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\n==The rise and fall of Kantakouzenos, 1341\u20131357==\n\nThe Byzantine Empire entered into a new era of decay in 1341. The Empire was ravaged by multiple serious disasters<ref name=\"Cyril265\">Mango, p. 265</ref> \u2014 alongside wars and civil wars, renewed epidemics of [[bubonic plague]] swept through its diminished lands. The first outbreak occurred in 1347, and between the 1360s and 1420s, eight further outbreaks of plague are recorded. Cities were full of social unrest between the corrupt wealthy (who had been exploiting the tax system for their own benefit) and the countless landless peasants burdened by the demands of the government.<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> Religious controversy, the cancer of Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries, once again emerged in the form of the [[Hesychasm]] controversy,<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> which eventually became a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox church. There were numerous earthquakes, destroying Byzantium's [[infrastructure]] \u2014 the fortress of Gallipoli was destroyed in 1354 by such an earthquake<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> and the Ottoman Turks lost no time in taking it and establishing a bridgehead in Europe. Meanwhile, the Serbs continued pressing south, removing any nominal Imperial control in Epirus. The Empire shrunk in size and when the civil war ended, Byzantium would be a petty city state, hanging on to life through the respites of her foes, and soon to-be protectors.\n\n===The civil war of 1341\u20131347===\n{{main|Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347}}\nJohn V, ten years old at his ascension, was guided by a regency consisting of his mother, [[Anna of Savoy]], John VI Kantakouzenos and the Patriarch of Constantinople ([[Patriarch John XIV of Constantinople|John XIV Kalekas]]).<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/>\n\nThe Patriarch, aided by the ambitious [[Alexios Apokaukos]], sparked the civil conflict when he convinced the Empress that John V's rule was threatened by the ambitions of Kantakouzenos. In September 1341, while Kantakouzenos was in Thrace, Kalekas declared himself as regent and launched a vicious attack on Kantakouzenos, his supporters and family.<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> In October, Anna ordered Kantakouzenos to resign his command.<ref name=\"Cyril266\">Mango, p. 266</ref> Kantakouzenos not only refused, but declared himself Emperor at [[Didymoteicho]]n, allegedly to protect John V's rule from Kalekas. Whether or not Kantakouzenos wished to be Emperor is not known, but the provocative actions of the Patriarch forced Kantakouzenos to fight to retain his power and started the civil war.\n\nThere were not nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders at the time and there certainly was not enough for the two factions to split; consequently, foreigner mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs \u2014 his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the [[Bey]] of [[Aydin]], a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship.<ref name=\"Cyril267\">Mango, p. 267</ref> This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.\n\n===Reign and fall of John VI Kantakouzenos, 1347\u20131357===\n[[File:Johannes V 1742.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Byzantine coins showing John V and his co-emperor & guide Kantakouzenos during their peaceful co-existence]]\nKantakouzenos had a son, Matthew Kantakouzenos \u2014 and any hope of keeping peace between John V and Matthew became more remote as the two grew older and more independent. John V wed Kantakouzenos' daughter, thus becoming his son in law,<ref name=\"Cyril267\"/> in a move designed to bind the two families, but it was destined to fail.\n\nIn 1353, Kantakouzenos was still hopeful that peace would be maintained, but in that year, John V launched a military attack on Matthew,<ref name=\"Cyril267\"/> thereby re-igniting the civil war. John V was demoted and exiled to the island of [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]], one of the few islands in the Aegean still under Byzantine control, while Kantakouzenos made his son Matthew co-emperor. John V would not give up so easy however, and in 1354 Ottoman troops began crossing over into Thrace in his support. The citizens of Constantinople became gripped with fear and in November of that same year, John V launched a successful coup with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoan]] aid. Kantakouzenos now abdicated and retired to a monastery, where he would write his memoirs and thoughts until his death in 1383.<ref name=\"Cyril268\">Mango, p. 268</ref>\n\nMatthew Kantakouzenos, no doubt disappointed with his father's failure, continued to resist John V. Since the Ottoman Sultan [[Orhan of the Ottoman Empire|Orhan]] was his brother-in-law, he was able to obtain troops from him, but had barely begun his campaign when he was captured in the summer of 1356. He was forced to renounce his claims in 1357 and exiled to the [[Morea]] sometime between 1361 and 1383,<ref name=\"Cyril268\"/> though other sources indicate 1391 a possible date. At 25 years, John V had managed to establish himself firmly as ruler of the Empire, at the cost of bleeding out all its resources.\n\n===Turkish immigration===\nThe lands ravaged and depopulated by the civil war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade.<ref name=\"Cyril268\"/> The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined beyond all recovery \u2014 two hundred years ago Byzantium could rely on the people living in the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely [[Thessalonica]] and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the [[Despotate of the Morea]]. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as it gave her most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe.\n\n==John V, 1354\u20131391==\n[[File:Byzance en 1367.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Byzantium (in red) in 1369, after the Ottomans conquered the city of Adrianople]]\n\n[[John V Palaiologos]] now had to face the serious threat the Ottomans posed to Byzantium. In the 1360s, the Turks continued to drive through Thrace, taking Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian settlements.\n\n===Plea to the West===\nLike his predecessors [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and Michael VIII, John V now turned to the Pope and offered the promise of a Union of the two Churches in the hopes of receiving military assistance. As a guarantee of compliance, John V offered his son, Manuel. In the past, Byzantium's cry for assistance were answered with mixed results \u2014 pillaging Crusaders would sack both friend and foe but the [[First Crusade]] had been largely beneficial and no doubt John V envisioned a repeat of such a Crusade. This time, however, the Papacy was unmoved by the calamity facing the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril269\">Mango, p. 269</ref>\n\nFortunately for John V, he had other European connections \u2014 his mother was [[Anna of Savoy]], and her nephew (being John V's cousin) was concerned for the safety of his Greek counterpart.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> Sailing from Venice in June 1366 with dreams of initiating yet another Crusade, [[Amadeo VI of Savoy]] arrived at and seized the fortress of Gallipoli from the Ottomans and handed it back to the Byzantines, hoping that this would stem the tide of Turkish emigration into Thrace.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> However, the Turks had by now firmly established themselves in Thrace. Amadeo and John spent much time between 1367 and 1369 thinking of ways to stave off defeat. Amadeo returned to Europe via Rome and brought with him Byzantine envoys. The Pope again was uninterested, but called for John V to visit him.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> In 1369, when the Ottomans finally captured Adrianople (though some sources indicate 1365),<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> John V rushed to Rome and confessed his Catholic faith both privately and at a public spectacle.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/>\n\nNevertheless, in 1371 John V returned empty-handed, having humiliated himself and done nothing to improve the deteriorating situation in the Balkans.\n\n===Ottoman vassalage of John V===\nIn 1371, the Serbs mustered their strength and prepared to launch an attack to drive back the Turks from Thrace. In a crushing victory, the Ottomans annihilated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]],<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> and in its aftermath, many surviving lords submitted to the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]]. Byzantium was in no better position and after taking [[Serres]] from the defeated Serbs, John V swore allegiance as a vassal to Murad.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/><ref name=\"Cyril270\">Mango, p. 270</ref>\n\n==Third Palaiologan Civil War, 1373\u20131394==\n{{main|Byzantine civil war of 1373\u20131379}}\n{{History of the Byzantine Empire}}\nJohn V's rule was an unhappy one, resulting in his vassalage to Murad I. However, it must have been all the more worse when his eldest son and heir to the throne [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]] rebelled against his father in 1373.<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> Curiously, this rebellion coincided with the rebellion of Murad I's son, [[Savci Celebi]]<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> and the two worked towards fomenting revolution in their peoples. Consequently, both the Byzantine and Ottoman rulers were facing their sons and as a result, coordinated efforts were made to defeat both.<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> John V had his eldest son, Andronikos IV, along with the latter's son, John VII, partially blinded, while Murad I defeated his son, Savci, and had him executed.<ref name=\"Cyril271\">Mango, p. 271</ref> [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel]], the second son of John V, was made co-emperor and heir to the throne.\n\nUnfortunately for John V, Andronikos IV and his son John VII escaped. With Genoan and Turkish aid, they returned to Constantinople and succeeded in overthrowing John V, imprisoning him and Manuel.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> In exchange for Ottoman aid, Andronikos IV handed the fortress of [[Gallipoli]] over to the Ottomans, thus rendering the only genuine European aid, provided by [[Amadeo, Prince of Achaea|Amadeo]] of [[Savoy]], useless. Again, prison break became the next event with John V and Manuel escaping Constantinople, offering the Ottoman Sultan higher tribute than normally paid, in return for help in taking over Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> Andronikos IV, having been beaten yet again, evaded capture and slipped into the Genoese district of [[Galata]] with his family and hostages. John V, only interested in securing his throne and stability, came to conclude a pact with Andronikos IV in 1381, recognizing him as heir with John VII as heir apparent,<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> thus removing Manuel from the line of succession.\n\nNaturally, Manuel felt betrayed by this move which demoted him from co-emperor. Returning to Thessalonica in 1382, he rebelled and established his rule over [[Thessaly]] and Epirus, thus \"expanding\" the Empire, at least nominally, and thereby catching the Ottoman Sultan's attention.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> Murad I besieged Thessalonica in 1383, beginning a siege that would last until 1387. Meanwhile, Andronikos IV died and his son, John VII, began quarreling with his grandfather, John V.\n\nWith Thessalonica surrendering in 1387 and his position rather hopeless, Manuel returned to John V and, with the Sultan's assent, began making conciliatory offers to his father.<ref name=\"Cyril272\">Mango, p. 272</ref> John V realized that accepting his second son back would cause his grandson to rebel in turn, and therefore he simply kept Manuel in exile in [[Lemnos]].<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> Eventually, John VII did rebel against his grandfather \u2014 news of Manuel's arrival at Constantinople and John V's reconciliation talks with him prompted John VII to head to [[Genoa]] and then to the new Ottoman Sultan, [[Bayezid the Thunderbolt]], to seek aid in order to topple John V.\n\nJohn VII's rebellion succeeded initially, taking Constantinople from John V,<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> but Manuel countered by rousing the rest of the empire and its few remaining military assets and turned them against John VII. Manuel also received aid from the [[Knights of St. John]] stationed at [[Rhodes]], where he \"donated\" religious relics made of precious metals to them for their support.<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> John refused to give up his right to rule as Emperor of Byzantium until his death in 1408. By then however, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid had recognized Manuel II Palaiologos as co-emperor of Byzantium alongside his father John V, and finally, when John V died in 1391, as sole Emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril273\">Mango, p. 273</ref>\n\n==Manuel II Palaiologos, 1391\u20131420==\n{{details|Manuel II Palaiologos}}\n\n[[File:1389 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Byzantium in 1389.<ref>Mango, p. 264</ref> Thrace was lost in the previous three decades.]]\n\nManuel II's reign saw another temporary respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, he succeeded in retaking some territory and held it to the end of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he lived long enough to see his son undo much of his achievements.\n\n===Vassalage to 1394===\nManuel II's first priority was to establish an agreement with [[Bayezid I]]. John VII was a favorite of Bayezid so Manuel II was in a dangerous position. He eventually sealed an agreement. However, the Ottoman Sultan became infuriated by Manuel II's attempts to reconcile his nephew John VII.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/> Manuel was concerned that John VII might once again launch a coup against him so wished to end the threat diplomatically. Bayezid ordered Manuel's execution, but then reduced his furious response and instead demanded that Constantinople build another Mosque and that a colony of Turks be established.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/>\n\n===Rebellion; Byzantium survives, 1394\u20131402===\nManuel's next steps were bold and seemingly foolish \u2014 not only did he refuse to pay the Sultan tribute, he refused to answer the Sultan's messages and Bayezid set about laying siege to Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/> In 1394, his siege began and would continue for eight years. Manuel II realized that while the City could endure a half-hearted blockade, it did not have the military assets to man the [[walls of Constantinople]]. At first, the situation was not so dire \u2014 a massive counter-attack by the West was to be launched as the Crusade of Nicopolis.<ref name=\"Cyril274\">Mango, p. 274</ref> In a [[Battle of Nicopolis|titanic battle]], Bayezid force-marched his army to a stunning yet costly victory. Thousands were killed, but now Bayezid was able to turn his armies fully against Constantinople.\n\nThe situation was dire; so much so that John VII, Manuel's dire opponent, was left in charge of Constantinople. He made one grand tour of Europe in 1399, stopping at [[Venice]], [[Padua]], [[Milan]], Paris and London, where he met the English [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]; in England, he was well received<ref name=\"Cyril274\"/> and treated to a jousting tournament. However, Manuel was unable to secure any help from Western Christendom.\n\nIn the end, it would be Eastern Islam that would come to Constantinople's aid \u2014 [[Timur]], the Khan of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] Mongols led his army deep into Anatolia, [[Battle of Ankara|decisively defeating]] Bayezid and his exhausted army in 1402 near Ankara. The defeat caused a panic amongst the Turks in Anatolia, who frantically began crossing over to Europe, albeit with hired Byzantine ships.\n\nManuel, who was still in Europe, arrived in 1403 to a welcoming sight \u2014 Constantinople free from Ottoman siege. John VII remained loyal, handing back the capital and even taking [[Thessalonica]] back from the Ottomans.\n\n===Ottoman Interregnum, 1402\u201313===\n[[File:Manuel II Paleologus.jpg|right|thumb|Manuel II lived to 75 years of age]]\nThe [[Ottoman Interregnum|defeat of the Ottomans]] considerably changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that only a short time had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, [[S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi|S\u00fcleyman]] who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained [[Mount Athos]] and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to [[Varna]]. As an added bonus, Imperial authority was asserted over a number of [[Aegean Islands]]. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.\n\nBayezid's sons lost no time fighting each other for their father's shattered realm. By 1413, [[Mehmed I]] had emerged as the victor. However, the Byzantines had made sure to support the victor and Mehmed I did not forget the kindness of the Byzantines and was able to \"control\" his Turk subjects from expanding into Byzantine territory.\n\n===Resumption of hostilities===\nManuel II Palaiologos was 70 years of age in 1421 and believed that the time had come for him to retire and give his eldest son, John VIII, the opportunity to rule with a more aggressive manner than he had done so. At the same time, a far less restrained [[Murad II]], son of Mehmed I, came to the Ottoman throne in May of that year. With two men uninterested in diplomacy on the thrones of Byzantium and the Ottoman Sultanate, [[Byzantine-Ottoman Wars|war]] was inevitable.\n\nThe Byzantines were the first to make a move when John VIII and his advisors made a risky decision by inciting a rebellion within the Ottoman Sultanate. In August 1421, they backed a man named Mustafa who claimed to be a long lost son of Bayezid the Thunderbolt. In Europe, Mustafa's rebellion worked well and he gathered some support. However, in August 1422, Murad II had this rebellion crushed and Mustafa received the traditional execution (hanging) shortly after, something any rebel would have expected. Murad II was enraged and had an [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|army sent to Constantinople]] and [[Siege of Thessalonika (1422)|to Thessalonika]], the latter falling in 1430. Murad II was unable to take Constantinople by force. Nonetheless, the situation in the Capital was dire enough for Manuel II to come out of retirement and incite yet another rebellion in Asia Minor under Murad II's brother, [[Kucuk Mustafa]]. Initial rebel success, including a siege of Bursa was too much for Murad II to ignore so the siege of Constantinople was lifted to deal with this threat, and to the Byzantines' greatest despair, dealt with it indeed.\n\nManuel II was now out of tricks to save the erroneous rule of his son, John VIII. In September 1423, Thessalonika was surrendered to the Venetians, no doubt hoping to draw in the Western Powers into crusading mode and, if not, at least their wealth would enable them to defend it better. In February 1424, Manuel II Palaiologos re-established Byzantium as a vassal of the Ottomans \u2014 300,000 silver coins were to be paid to the Sultan on annual basis. That the Empire managed to accomplish this at its lowest ebb is remarkable. Nonetheless until the 1450s, the Ottomans would not make any concerted efforts to overcome the walls of Constantinople, and the city retained a tenuous security for the next two decades.\n\n== John VIII takes over ==\n{{details|John VIII Palaiologos}}\n[[File:National gallery in washington d.c., pisanello, medaglia di giovanni di bisanzio recto.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[Medal of the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos]] during his visit to Florence, by [[Pisanello]] (1438). The legend reads, in Greek: \"John the Palaiologos, ''[[basileus]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of the Romans\".]]\n\nManuel II's final years saw his gains wasted and the Empire ''status quo ante'' 1391. John VIII was still hopeful that he could emulate his Father's success and more. Like his predecessors, his attempts were in vain. And just like his predecessors, he relied too heavily on a Pope not willingly to give, only take; take that is, the Church of a wretched state surrounded by the Ottomans, soon-to-be Christendom's direst foe.\n\n===Union with Rome===\nUniting the Church of Byzantium with that of Rome was a simple matter, since all the bargaining chips were in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic]] West. John VIII, as the ''de facto'' head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the [[Filioque clause|Filioque]] dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in [[Ferrara]] and [[Florence]], not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.\n\n=== Varna ===\nIn the late 1440s, the Ottomans experienced difficulty in bringing their Christian vassals in the Balkans into line. [[Hungary]] began launching successful campaigns against the Turks in Serbia, leading to the Serbian Despot and the Albanian resistance leader [[Skanderbeg|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] into direct opposition with their former masters. This led to one of the last great Crusades of a united Western Christendom \u2014 [[Crusade of Varna]]. Murad II was in no position to stop these troublesome westerners since he was overwhelmed with problems by easterners in Anatolia, the core of the Ottoman realm. Therefore, Murad hastily concluded a peace treaty in the Balkans. The Hungarians soon broke the treaty, but at Varna a hastily assembled Ottoman army crushed the Crusaders and left the Balkans at the mercy of Ottoman vengeance.\n\nJohn VIII died in 1448. His reign lasted two decades. His achievement was the continued survival of the Empire. Yet Byzantium was now hanging by a thread. With insufficient military manpower for its own defense, an economy ruined by years of warfare, a depopulated capital, and insufficient territory to provide a basis for recovery, the Empire's position was becoming untenable. John was severely constrained by his circumstances, and proved unable to improve the fortunes of the state. He was succeeded by his brother [[Constantine XI]]. The new emperor would be Byzantium's last sovereign ruler.\n\n== Constantine XI ==\n{{details|Constantine XI}}\nConstantine's reign was short; from 1448 (some sources say 1449) until 1453. Constantine XI, like many of his predecessors who took the Union between Eastern and Western Christendom seriously, lived as a Catholic. Not much is known of his reign, except that he died with his soldiers in the final fight for Constantinople.\n\n===Defiance, defence and defeat===\n[[File:Constantine Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine XI depicted in semi-classical armour.]]\n{{main|Fall of Constantinople}}\nConstantine XI was the [[Despot of the Morea]] before his ascension to the throne. From this position, he had continued the aggressive policies of his father and his brothers against the Ottomans and their vassals, the [[Duchy of Athens]], but had been forced to back down by [[Murad II]]. In 1451, [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father Murad. Upon his succession to the throne, he received a demand by Constantine XI for subsidies, coupled with a threat to rebel if these were not met. Mehmed II responded with these bold declarations by building a [[Rumelihisar\u0131|fortress]] on the European side of the Bosporus in order to better control traffic through the Bosporus.\n\nMehmed II assembled a huge army to assail Constantinople's landward walls \u2014 some sources suggest 80,000 soldiers, while others suggest figures as high as 100,000 or even 200,000, including camp followers. A major feature of the Ottoman army was its high-quality artillery. Among others, it featured a number of \"super-cannons\" built by [[Orban]], a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] engineer who had originally offered his services to Constantine, who rejected them for lack of money.<ref name=\"Runciman 79-80\">{{cite book|last = Runciman|first = Steven|authorlink=Steven Runciman|year = 1990|title = The Fall of Constantinople, 1453|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0-521-39832-9|pages=79\u201380}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicolle 13\">{{cite book|last = Nicolle|first = David|authorlink=David Nicolle|year = 2000|title = Constantinople 1453: The end of Byzantium|publisher = Osprey Publishing|isbn = 1-84176-091-9|page=13}}</ref> After the rejection of terms of surrender by Constantine, the siege began on April 2, 1453, with Ottoman cannon firing from April 6. The defenders were few, but the mighty walls allowed them to withstand the siege for some time. Finally however, on May 29, the Ottomans achieved a breach, and the city fell. Constantine XI charged at the oncoming Ottoman army; the last Roman Emperor died fighting, and since his body was never recognized, is assumed to have been buried in a mass grave.\n\n===Conclusion===\nConstantine's rule is hard to assess due to the shortness of his reign. As a Despot, he had shown ability, but the fall of the Empire to the Turks was by his time inevitable, no matter how able and energetic an Emperor sat on the throne. What is most remembered of him is the stubborn defence of his city against the odds, and his death in battle, through which he entered popular legend. Despite his Catholic confession, he is viewed as a saint by many [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and many legends were created about the ultimate fate of the last Constantine.\n\n==Learning under the Palaiologoi==\n===Second Byzantine/Palaiologan Renaissance===\n{{details|Renaissance}}\nDespite much chaos in the Empire, the Byzantines experienced a revival in culture and art within their domain. Towards the 14th century, as the Empire entered into a phase of terminal crisis, such achievements became less valued. All was not lost for these seemingly rejected scholars \u2014 many in Italy who had been opened up to Byzantium by the maritime expansions of Genoa and Venice came to appreciate their achievements, facilitating the Renaissance. As such these scholars found themselves in Italian institutions, expressing their Greco-Roman culture for pay. Immigration to Italy was made less attractive by the idea of abandoning the Orthodox faith to practice Catholicism. Nonetheless, a significant and increasing number of Greeks began travelling to Italy, first temporarily to Italian colonies such as [[Crete]] or [[Cyprus]] before returning to Byzantium, then as the Empire began to fail horribly, in more permanent manner. The Fall of Constantinople was marked by large numbers of Greek refugees escaping Turkic rule into Europe via Italy and thus accelerating the Renaissance.\n\n===Restoration of the Classics<!--linked from 'Scholia'-->===\n[[File:Dionysos satyr Altemps Inv8606.jpg|thumb|right|Classical literature that was studied included mythical figures such as Dionysus.]]\nThe Fourth Crusade saw the destruction of many homes in Constantinople and much of the city on fire. It is difficult to determine what books were burned in the libraries of Constantinople, though one can only imagine that few would be available today were it not for the works of [[Demetrius Triclinius]], [[Manuel Moschopoulos]], [[Thomas Magister]] and [[Maximos Planudes]]. New editions of poets, such as Hesiod and Pindar, were made and their metric systems were reconstructed with competence. They wrote about such works as [[Scholia]] and [[Pindar]]. Countless works are also included, such as the [[Sophocles|tragedians of Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], Ptolemy's ''Geography'', Nonnus of Panaopolis' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', edits and \"rediscoveries\" on [[Plutarch]] and the Greek Anthology of epigrams. Works assembled by [[Theodore Metochites]] at the Monastery of [[Chora Church|Chora]] can be found in the libraries of [[Istanbul]], [[Oxford]], the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and even Paris.\n\n===Greek Byzantium===\nIn the past, at its full height, the Byzantine Empire was composed of many territories, [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty|stretching from modern-day Iraq to modern-day Spain]]. As the Empire's borders shrunk, so too had its cultural diversity. By the late 13th century, the Empire consisted almost exclusively of traditionally Greek territory (inhabited by Greeks since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]). Consequently, this Greek culture soon came to dominate the Empire and the works of the Classical age such as those of [[Sophocles]] and [[Theocritus]] were meticulously copied and annotated.\n\nNotable philosophers include [[Planudes]] who characterized the interest in Science and Mathematics at the time. Astronomy was also a field of interest, as [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] illustrates with his proposal to modify the calendar before changes were put in place by the Gregorian reform.\n\nMoreover, some prominent personalities also proposed the change of the Imperial title to 'Emperor of the [[Hellenes]]', instead of Romans. This enthusiasm for the glorious past, contained elements that were also present in the movement that led to the creation of the modern [[Greece|Greek]] state, in 1830, after four centuries of Ottoman rule.<ref>Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasiliev [https://books.google.com/books?id=2X8LtjDLNl8C&pg=PA582 History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, Vol. 2]. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1952, {{ISBN|9780299809263}}, p. 582</ref>\n\n===Persian science enters, circa 1300===\nAt the time, [[astrologist]]s had to rely on [[Ptolemy]]'s tables for calculations. However, these proved to be inaccurate when compared to Arab [[astronomy]]. As a result, Persian tables were used more often, even if in conjunction with Ptolemy's. The acceptance of Arab astronomy was made harder by the fact that it had to be translated, and only entered through \"lowlier social channels\", namely by men who travelled between Constantinople and [[Trabzon|Trebizond]]. Such men included [[Gregory Choniades]] and his follower [[George Chrysokokkes]], who acquainted themselves with this science. By the mid 14th century, when Byzantium was overwhelmed with troubles, the tables of Ptolemy were deemed by professionals as inadequate and slowly abandoned for Persian tables.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nDespite this, Persian works such as those on [[astrolabe]] were translated into Greek as early as 1309. In 1352, [[Theodore Metochites]] published his thoughts using Persian and Ptolemaic tables.\n\nSuch works, while being non-Christian and in many cases non-Hellenistic, were cultivated by the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastics. Both Choniades and Metochites established themselves in the Greek Orthodox Church; the former becoming Bishop of [[Tabriz]] and the latter the head of the Patriarchal school.\n[[File:Tempio malatestiano.jpg|thumb|left|Plethon's final resting place was moved to the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], [[Italy]] by his Italian disciples.]]\nNot all thinkers were welcome in Byzantium. Some who opened their minds to other beliefs would have strayed from the \"[[one true Religion]]\", as the Byzantines would have seen it. One such example is that of [[Plethon]]. His works on computational astronomy using Hebrew and Persian tables were overshadowed by the neo-pagan beliefs he adopted in his old age. He proclaimed his belief in the \"Seven Wise Men\", the message of [[Zoroaster]] and [[Fatalism]]. Consequently, his work on a modified Greek Pantheon, ''The Laws'' was burnt by the Patriarch of Constantinople. Plethon's ashes repose in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] of [[Rimini]].\n\nOthers went so far as to suggest that Byzantium would not live forever \u2014 a fundamental belief for every subject of the Byzantine Orthodox Church. Metochites did not see Byzantine civilization as superior to others and even considered the \"[[infidel]]\" [[Tatars]] as more enlightened in some aspects, such as morality, than his Christian co-religionists.\n\n===Patronage===\nPhilosophers had to find ways of bringing food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally-based or, earlier in the Empire, trade-based. In contrast, philosophers needed [[patronage]] in order to survive. The most important source was from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the wealthy, and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy, although only bishops had such resources.\n\nAs the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances in its efforts to defend its borders. Study in the fields of science and mathematics naturally disappeared from the minds of those whose lands were raided and seized. It was due to this lack of patronage that led many scholars to flee to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by [[John Argyropoulos]], [[Constance]], [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], who between them had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. The end of the Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe end of the Byzantine Empire did not seem inevitable to contemporaries. As late as 1444, a mere nine years before the [[Fall of Constantinople]], there were high hopes that the Turks would be driven out of Europe. The Byzantines that pinned their dreams of restoration on the West had hoped that they could reap the benefits of another \"[[First Crusade]]\" that would cut a swathe through Asia Minor and allow Byzantine troops to re-occupy the empire's ancient heartlands. However, by the late 14th century, the Byzantine Empire did not possess sufficient resources for the task, and in any case such Western undertakings would have required Byzantium to submit to Rome. If the price for political freedom was religious freedom, certain emperors such as [[Michael VIII]] were willing to pay it. In the long run though, the Byzantines were not prepared to surrender their ancient customs and beliefs willingly.\n\nThe proximate cause of the problem lay in Byzantium's numerous enemies, who combined during the course of the 14th century to overwhelm what remained of the empire's core territories. With each passing decade, the Byzantine Empire became weaker and lost more land. There were fewer resources available to deal with the Empire's opponents. Her power base was consequently ruined. While the empire had experienced difficulties before (in the 8th century much of Byzantium's lands were occupied by [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and Arabs), by the later 14th century the empire no longer possessed any significant territories (such as Asia Minor) to form the basis of a recovery. As a result, many attempts at driving back the Ottomans and Bulgarians failed, while the lack of territory, revenue and manpower meant that Byzantium's armies became increasingly obsolete and outnumbered.\n\nHowever, the most serious problems arose from the internal political and military organisation of the empire. The empire's political system, based as it was around an autocratic and semi-divine emperor who exercised absolute power, had become obsolete, while the civil wars the system produced severely weakened the empire from within, leaving it disastrously exposed to outside attack. Furthermore, the empire's military system had become increasingly disorganised and chaotic, following the demise of the theme system in the 11th\u201313th centuries. The result was persistent failure and defeat on every frontier.\n\nByzantium could only lose and decline for so long before it destroyed her; by the late 14th century, the situation had become so severe that Byzantium surrendered her political independence. By the mid 15th century, restoring both the religious and the political freedom of Byzantium was ultimately an impossible cause.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Family trees of the Byzantine imperial dynasties]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Justinian Dynasty]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Heraclian]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Isaurians]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Macedonians]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Doukids]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Komnenoi]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Angeloi]]\n* [[Despotate of the Morea]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Madden, Thomas F.

Together with the preceding [[Nicaean Empire]] and the contemporary ''[[Frankokratia]]'', this period is known as the '''late Byzantine Empire'''.\n\nFrom the start, the r\u00e9gime faced numerous problems.<ref name=\"Cyril255\">Mango, p. 255</ref> The [[Turkish people|Turks]] of [[Asia Minor]] had since 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. [[Anatolia]], which had formed the very heart of the shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'', whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by [[Islamic]] zeal, the prospect of economic gain, and the desire to seek refuge from the Mongols<ref name=\"John Joseph Saunders\">John Joseph Saunders, pp. 79</ref> after the disastrous [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] in 1243. With a decreasing source of food and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Serbian Empire]], the remnants of the [[Latin Empire]] and even the [[Knights Hospitaller]].\n\nThe loss of land in the east to the Turks and in the west to the Bulgarians was complemented by two disastrous civil wars, the [[Black Death]] and the 1354 earthquake at [[Gallipoli]], whose destruction and evacuation allowed the Turks to occupy it. By 1380, the Byzantine Empire consisted of the capital [[Constantinople]] and a few other isolated exclaves, which only nominally recognized the Emperor as their lord. Nonetheless, Byzantine diplomacy coupled with the adroit exploitation of internal divisions and external threats among their enemies, and above all the invasion of Anatolia by [[Timur]], allowed Byzantium to survive until 1453. The last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Despotate of the Morea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], fell shortly afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Palaiologan period witnessed a renewed flourishing in art and the letters, in what has been called the \"Palaiologian Renaissance\". The [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|migration of Byzantine scholars]] to the West also helped to spark the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Byzantium1215.jpg|thumb|right|400px|After 1204, the Byzantine Empire was partitioned between various successor states, with the Latin Empire in control of Constantinople]]\nFollowing the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantine Empire had fractured into the Greek successor-states of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and Trebizond, with a multitude of Frankish and Latin possessions occupying the remainder, nominally subject to the [[Latin Empire|Latin Emperors]] at Constantinople. In addition, the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire allowed the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], the Serbs and the various Turcoman emirates of Anatolia to make gains. Although Epirus was initially the strongest of the three Greek states, the Nicaeans were the ones who succeeded in taking back the city of Constantinople from the Latin Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril254\">Mango, p. 254</ref>\n\nThe Nicaean Empire was successful in holding its own against its Latin and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] opponents. At the [[Battle of Meander Valley]], a Turkic force was repelled<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> and an earlier assault on Nicaea led to the death of the Seljuk Sultan. In the west, the Latins were unable to expand into Anatolia; consolidating Thrace against Bulgaria was a challenge that kept the Latins occupied for the duration of the Latin Empire.\n\nIn 1261, the Empire of Nicaea was ruled by [[John IV Laskaris]], a boy of ten years.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> However, John IV was overshadowed by his co-emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. Palaiologos was a leading noble of military standing and the main figure of the regency of John IV, who had used this role to propel himself to the throne, and set the stage for his becoming sole Emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire.\n\n==Michael VIII Palaiologos, 1261\u20131282==\n[[File:Hyperpyron-Michael VIII Paleologus-sb2241.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Hyperpyron of Michael VIII]]\n{{main|Michael VIII Palaiologos}}\n\nIn 1261, while the bulk of the Latin Empire's military forces were absent from Constantinople, the Byzantine General [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] used the opportunity to seize the city with 600 troops. [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessalonica]] had already been taken by Nicaea in 1246.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> Following the capture of Constantinople, Michael ordered the blinding of John IV in December 1261, so as to become sole emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril254\"/> As a result, Patriarch [[Patriarch Arsenius I of Constantinople|Arsenios]] excommunicated Michael, but he was deposed and replaced by [[Patriarch Joseph I of Constantinople|Joseph I]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Restoration of Constantinople===\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] and their successors, the Latin Empire, had done much to reduce Byzantium's finest city to an underpopulated wreck.<ref name=\"Madden110113\">Madden, pp. 110\u2013113</ref> Michael VIII began the task of restoring many monasteries, public buildings and defence works.<ref name=\"Cyril256\">Mango, p. 256</ref> The [[Hagia Sophia]], horribly looted in the Crusade of 1204, was refurbished to Greek Orthodox tradition. The [[Kontoskalion]] harbour and the [[walls of Constantinople]] were all strengthened against a possible new expedition by the Latin West. Many hospitals, hospices, markets, baths, streets and churches were built, some with private patronage. Even a new Mosque was built to compensate for the one burnt during the Fourth Crusade.<ref name=\"Cyril256\"/> These attempts were costly and crippling taxes were placed on the peasantry.<ref name=\"Madden179\">Madden, p. 179</ref> Nonetheless, the city grew new cultural and diplomatic contacts, notably with the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)#Bahri rule|Mamelukes]]. Both had common enemies; Latin aggression, and later on, the Ottoman Turks.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nThe [[Sultanate of Rum]] was in chaos and decentralized ever since the [[Mongol]] invasions in ca. 1240.<ref>Lowe, Steven, and Martin Baker. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027082448/http://geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm \"Seljuks of Rum\".] 21 Feb. 1992. 29 May 2007</ref> As a result, the greatest threat to Byzantium was not the Muslims but their Christian counterparts in the West \u2014 Michael VIII knew that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] would no doubt launch another attempt to establish [[Latin Empire|Latin rule]] in Constantinople. The situation became worse when [[Charles I of Anjou]] conquered [[Sicily]] from the [[Hohenstaufens]] in 1266.<ref name=\"Cyril257\">Mango, p. 257</ref> In 1267, [[Pope Clement IV]] arranged a pact, whereby Charles would receive land in the East in return for assisting a new military expedition to Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril257\"/> A delay on Charles' end meant that Michael VIII was given enough time to negotiate a union between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople in 1274, thus removing papal support for an invasion of Constantinople.\n\nUnfortunately for Michael VIII, the new union was seen as a fake by Clement's successor, [[Martin IV]]. The Greek Church was excommunicated, and Charles was given renewed papal support for the invasion of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril258\">Mango, p. 258</ref> In order to counter this, Michael VIII subsidized [[Peter III of Aragon]]'s attempts to seize Sicily from Charles.  Michael's efforts paid off with the outbreak of the [[Sicilian Vespers]], a revolt that overthrew the Angevin King of Sicily and installed Peter III of Aragon as King of Sicily in 1281.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/>\n\nFor the remainder of his life, Michael campaigned to drive the Latins out of Greece and the Balkans, and secure his position versus the Bulgarians. He was largely successful, regaining several islands in the Aegean, and establishing a foothold in the Peloponnese, that would grow to become the [[Despotate of the Morea]]. The downside however was that Michael's efforts in the West absorbed most of the Empire's manpower and resources, and neglected the Asian provinces, where a new and fateful threat was rising: the beylik of [[Osman I]], who by 1263 had captured [[Sogut]]. Nevertheless, the border was kept relatively secure, and no significant losses occurred in Asia Minor during Michael's reign.\n[[File:1263 Mediterranean Sea.svg|thumb|400px|right|Middle East c. 1263<ref name=\"Madden162\">Madden, p. 162</ref><ref name=\"Grant93\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|page=93}}</ref><ref>Shepherd, William R. \"The Byzantine Empire in 1265.\" Perry\u2013Casta\u00f1eda Library. 1926.

The result was that heavy taxes were levied on the peasantry,<ref name=\"Madden179\"/> something that the Ottomans would later use to their advantage, winning over these poverty-stricken peasants with promises of lower taxes.\n\nThe [[Second Council of Lyons]] and the ostensible union of the two Churches did little to avert Catholic aggression, while at the same time the Orthodox population, led by large parts of the priesthood, denounced Michael VIII as a traitor.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/> His death in 1282 came as a relief to many, and his body was denied an Orthodox funeral, as a result of his policies towards Rome.<ref name=\"Cyril258\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nMichael VIII was a very energetic, ambitious and capable emperor who had enlarged and preserved the Empire and had once again made Byzantium a power to be reckoned with in the region. His army, however, was still small, and diplomacy was relied upon more than ever. An extortionate tax system supported his ambitious and successful foreign policies of expansion, as well as his numerous bribes and gifts to various potentates. He had put Byzantium on the road of recovery, but his achievements were still perilously fragile, as events would soon show.\n\n==Andronikos II Palaiologos, 1282\u20131328==\n{{main|Andronikos II Palaiologos}}\n\nAndronikos II was the son of Michael VIII. He ascended the throne in 1282, at the age of 24.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nAndronikos II was tied down with events in the West and the East. The Serbians under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin]] had begun invading the Balkans and took [[Skopje]] in 1282<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and raids against Macedonia were launched throughout the 1290s. Byzantine counter-attacks failed to stop these, and as a result Andronikos was forced to resort to diplomacy, marrying his 5-year-old daughter to the Serbian King<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and ceding a number of forts from [[Ohrid]] to [[\u0160tip|Stip]] to [[Strumica]] as a \"dowry\". Nonetheless, the Serbs continued their expansion.\n\nUnlike his father, Andronikos II recognized the gravity of the situation in Asia Minor,<ref name=\"Cyril260\">Mango, p. 260</ref> and tried to drive out the Turks, utilizing a variety of methods. His first action was to move his court to Asia Minor, where he could better oversee the construction of fortifications and raise troop morale.<ref name=\"Cyril261\">Mango, p. 261</ref> His General, [[Alexios Philanthropenos]], was an able commander, campaigning with some success against the Turks in the Meander Valley. Unfortunately Byzantium was robbed of his services when he staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/> Next Andronikos sent his son, [[Michael IX]], and the Heteriarch [[George Mouzalon]] to attack the Turks who were laying siege to [[Nicomedia]], but they were beaten at the [[Battle of Bapheus]] in 1302.\n\nNot giving up, Andronikos hired the 6,500 strong \"[[Catalan Company]]\" of [[Almogavars]], led by [[Roger de Flor]]. Originating from [[Catalonia]], these hardy mercenaries were used to skirmishing against the [[Moors]] in Spain and now, for an extraordinarily high price, they drove the Turks back in Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/> Once again, these successes were nullified when their leader, Roger de Flor, was assassinated on his way to meet Andronikos; the Catalans then revolted against imperial authority, and began pillaging and raiding cities in Thrace, leaving Asia Minor open to Turkish incursions. After this, Andronikos turned to diplomacy, asking the [[Ilkhanids]] of Persia to send troops to attack the Turks, but negotiations for such an alliance failed.<ref name=\"Cyril261\"/>\n\n===Domestic policy===\n[[File:Tornese Andronicus II.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Andronikos II's debasement of the Byzantine currency, along with his co-rule with his father, his son and his grandson as well as his own sole rule, resulted in the minting of several different coins during his reign.]]\nAndronikos II ordered the Union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches to be canceled, a move which pleased many. But he also ordered drastic reductions in the military, and effectively disbanded the navy,<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> which his father had worked hard to build up. As a result, tax reductions throughout the Empire were possible,<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> earning him greater popularity while seriously undermining Byzantium's abilities to deal with its opponents. He debased the ''[[hyperpyron]]'' currency<ref name=\"Cyril260\"/> and heavily taxed the military elite of the ''[[pronoia]]rioi'', thereby further reducing Byzantium's military capability. While these solved some problems that Michael VIII had left for his son, it unraveled his father's attempts at restoring the power of the Byzantine Empire; where Michael VIII had attempted to deal with problems outside the Empire, Andronikos aimed to solve the internal problems resulting from his father's reign.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Civil War and abdication===\nAndronikos II's policies were not successful in dealing with Byzantium's external problems; however, it would be threats from within the Empire that led to his abdication \u2014 in 1320 Andronikos III, the young (in his twenties) grandson of Andronikos II was disinherited by the Emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril262\">Mango, p. 262</ref> Andronikos III's brother Manuel Palaiologos had been accidentally murdered by Andronikos III's companions over a competitive love affair. His father (Michael IX), the son of Andronikos II, died of shock as a result of his son's death. Andronikos III did not take his disinheritance lightly \u2014 organizing an armed opposition, he succeeded in drawing support with promises of generous tax cuts, even beyond those enacted by Andronikos II.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> Andronikos II was powerless to stop the young usurper; he granted him [[Thrace]] as an [[appanage]] in 1321,<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> the title of co-emperor in 1322,<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> and after a small war where the Bulgarians and Serbians played the two sides against each other, Andronikos II was forced to abdicate and retire as a monk to a monastery, where he died in 1332.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/>\n\nDespite the calamities of the civil war, Andronikos III was about to revitalise the Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/> Although Asia Minor was at this point destined to fall to the Turks, it had been in a worse position in 1091 and yet still recovered by Byzantium.\n\n===Legacy===\nAndronikos II attempted to solve Byzantium's internal problems more than his father had. The solutions  he chose however had severe repercussions. They undermined the military and financial basis of the state, and the disasters suffered by his foreign policy failures further worsened the situation. Dissatisfaction from his failure, his old age and a \"reckless grandson\" culminated in his abdication.<ref name=\"Cyril262\"/>\n\n==Andronikos III, 1328\u20131341==\n{{main|Andronikos III Palaiologos}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:1328 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|400px|right|Byzantium at the beginning of Andronikos III's reign.]]\nThe rule of Andronikos III is characterized as the last genuine attempt to restore Byzantine fortunes. His attempts came close to fruition, but the many hostile neighbors of Byzantium eventually took their toll on an Empire in decline.\n\nHis first concern was that of Asia Minor. Nicaea, until 1261 the capital of the Empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III launched a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the [[Battle of Pelekanon]] on June 10,<ref name=\"Cyril263\">Mango, p. 263</ref> and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see [[Nicomedia]] or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute \u2014 the Ottomans did not stop at this and seized Nicomedia as well in 1337.\n\nDespite this, Andronikos III scored a few successes in the Aegean: in 1329, Chios was recovered,<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> and in 1335, Andronikos arranged an alliance involving financial indemnities with the Turkic [[Emir]] [[Umur Beg|Bahud-din Umur]], [[Bey]] of [[Aydinids|Aydin]], and was able to recover [[Lesbos]] and [[Phocaea]] from the Latins.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\nIn Europe, Andronikos III had mixed results; Thessaly returned to Imperial rule in 1333, but Serbia once again began expanding southwards: led by the Byzantine renegade [[Syrgiannes Palaiologos]], Serbian forces took five key forts from Byzantium in 1334 and forced it to recognize the new borders.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> Andronikos was then forced to recognize Serbian rule in Macedonia. In addition, Andronikos faced a further reversal when leading his army at Rousokastron where he was defeated by the Bulgarians under their leader Ivan Alexander. Nevertheless, Andronikos was able to bring back Epirus into the fold in 1341 through the use of diplomacy.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/> The result was that while the Empire was reduced to its European territories, it had succeeded in bringing much of Greece under its control. Unfortunately for the newly expanded Byzantium, [[Stephen Dusan]] (ruling Serbia from 1331) decided to take these lands as well from Byzantium. The death of Andronikos III and the resulting chaos left the Empire in no position to fight back.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nAlthough ultimately unsuccessful, the reign of Andronikos III was one of the last bright spots in Byzantine history, as the Empire's position was becoming increasingly precarious. Andronikos was able to score some successes in his life as he campaigned vigorously against the Genoese with success and reestablished some control over Epirus and Thessaly. Throughout his reign, he was also able to work with competent administrators such as John Kantakouzenos who, along with many of the nobles supported Andronikos during the civil war with Andronikos II, However, numerous reversals against Byzantium's enemies such as Serbia and the rising Ottomans at battles such as Pelekanon further drained the power Byzantium had in comparison to its neighbors. This would be a situation that would not be helped by his sudden death in the 1340s which resulted in a civil war between the regency of John V(a coalition of Anna of Savoy, Alexios Apokaukos and the patriarch of Constantinople, John XIV) and the nobility who promoted John Kantakouzenos as emperor.<ref>Editors of Britannica, editor. \"Andronicus III Palaeologus\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc., June 11, 2018, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andronicus-III-Palaeologus</ref> In addition, diplomacy became less useful, as Byzantium's enemies realized that the Emperor had not the military or even economic might to back his word. While there was a general decline in the Empire's fortunes, Andronikos III's death would be the ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' for the Empire \u2014 his 10-year-old son was led by a regency that was torn apart in dynastic rivalries which led to the Second Palaiologan Civil War and the recognition of John Kantakouzenos as emperor and a catastrophe from which Byzantium would never recover.<ref name=\"Cyril263\"/>\n\n==The rise and fall of Kantakouzenos, 1341\u20131357==\n\nThe Byzantine Empire entered into a new era of decay in 1341. The Empire was ravaged by multiple serious disasters<ref name=\"Cyril265\">Mango, p. 265</ref> \u2014 alongside wars and civil wars, renewed epidemics of [[bubonic plague]] swept through its diminished lands. The first outbreak occurred in 1347, and between the 1360s and 1420s, eight further outbreaks of plague are recorded. Cities were full of social unrest between the corrupt wealthy (who had been exploiting the tax system for their own benefit) and the countless landless peasants burdened by the demands of the government.<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> Religious controversy, the cancer of Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries, once again emerged in the form of the [[Hesychasm]] controversy,<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> which eventually became a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox church. There were numerous earthquakes, destroying Byzantium's [[infrastructure]] \u2014 the fortress of Gallipoli was destroyed in 1354 by such an earthquake<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> and the Ottoman Turks lost no time in taking it and establishing a bridgehead in Europe. Meanwhile, the Serbs continued pressing south, removing any nominal Imperial control in Epirus. The Empire shrunk in size and when the civil war ended, Byzantium would be a petty city state, hanging on to life through the respites of her foes, and soon to-be protectors.\n\n===The civil war of 1341\u20131347===\n{{main|Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347}}\nJohn V, ten years old at his ascension, was guided by a regency consisting of his mother, [[Anna of Savoy]], John VI Kantakouzenos and the Patriarch of Constantinople ([[Patriarch John XIV of Constantinople|John XIV Kalekas]]).<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/>\n\nThe Patriarch, aided by the ambitious [[Alexios Apokaukos]], sparked the civil conflict when he convinced the Empress that John V's rule was threatened by the ambitions of Kantakouzenos. In September 1341, while Kantakouzenos was in Thrace, Kalekas declared himself as regent and launched a vicious attack on Kantakouzenos, his supporters and family.<ref name=\"Cyril265\"/> In October, Anna ordered Kantakouzenos to resign his command.<ref name=\"Cyril266\">Mango, p. 266</ref> Kantakouzenos not only refused, but declared himself Emperor at [[Didymoteicho]]n, allegedly to protect John V's rule from Kalekas. Whether or not Kantakouzenos wished to be Emperor is not known, but the provocative actions of the Patriarch forced Kantakouzenos to fight to retain his power and started the civil war.\n\nThere were not nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders at the time and there certainly was not enough for the two factions to split; consequently, foreigner mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs \u2014 his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the [[Bey]] of [[Aydin]], a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship.<ref name=\"Cyril267\">Mango, p. 267</ref> This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.\n\n===Reign and fall of John VI Kantakouzenos, 1347\u20131357===\n[[File:Johannes V 1742.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Byzantine coins showing John V and his co-emperor & guide Kantakouzenos during their peaceful co-existence]]\nKantakouzenos had a son, Matthew Kantakouzenos \u2014 and any hope of keeping peace between John V and Matthew became more remote as the two grew older and more independent. John V wed Kantakouzenos' daughter, thus becoming his son in law,<ref name=\"Cyril267\"/> in a move designed to bind the two families, but it was destined to fail.\n\nIn 1353, Kantakouzenos was still hopeful that peace would be maintained, but in that year, John V launched a military attack on Matthew,<ref name=\"Cyril267\"/> thereby re-igniting the civil war. John V was demoted and exiled to the island of [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]], one of the few islands in the Aegean still under Byzantine control, while Kantakouzenos made his son Matthew co-emperor. John V would not give up so easy however, and in 1354 Ottoman troops began crossing over into Thrace in his support. The citizens of Constantinople became gripped with fear and in November of that same year, John V launched a successful coup with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoan]] aid. Kantakouzenos now abdicated and retired to a monastery, where he would write his memoirs and thoughts until his death in 1383.<ref name=\"Cyril268\">Mango, p. 268</ref>\n\nMatthew Kantakouzenos, no doubt disappointed with his father's failure, continued to resist John V. Since the Ottoman Sultan [[Orhan of the Ottoman Empire|Orhan]] was his brother-in-law, he was able to obtain troops from him, but had barely begun his campaign when he was captured in the summer of 1356. He was forced to renounce his claims in 1357 and exiled to the [[Morea]] sometime between 1361 and 1383,<ref name=\"Cyril268\"/> though other sources indicate 1391 a possible date. At 25 years, John V had managed to establish himself firmly as ruler of the Empire, at the cost of bleeding out all its resources.\n\n===Turkish immigration===\nThe lands ravaged and depopulated by the civil war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade.<ref name=\"Cyril268\"/> The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined beyond all recovery \u2014 two hundred years ago Byzantium could rely on the people living in the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely [[Thessalonica]] and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the [[Despotate of the Morea]]. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as it gave her most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe.\n\n==John V, 1354\u20131391==\n[[File:Byzance en 1367.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Byzantium (in red) in 1369, after the Ottomans conquered the city of Adrianople]]\n\n[[John V Palaiologos]] now had to face the serious threat the Ottomans posed to Byzantium. In the 1360s, the Turks continued to drive through Thrace, taking Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian settlements.\n\n===Plea to the West===\nLike his predecessors [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and Michael VIII, John V now turned to the Pope and offered the promise of a Union of the two Churches in the hopes of receiving military assistance. As a guarantee of compliance, John V offered his son, Manuel. In the past, Byzantium's cry for assistance were answered with mixed results \u2014 pillaging Crusaders would sack both friend and foe but the [[First Crusade]] had been largely beneficial and no doubt John V envisioned a repeat of such a Crusade. This time, however, the Papacy was unmoved by the calamity facing the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=\"Cyril269\">Mango, p. 269</ref>\n\nFortunately for John V, he had other European connections \u2014 his mother was [[Anna of Savoy]], and her nephew (being John V's cousin) was concerned for the safety of his Greek counterpart.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> Sailing from Venice in June 1366 with dreams of initiating yet another Crusade, [[Amadeo VI of Savoy]] arrived at and seized the fortress of Gallipoli from the Ottomans and handed it back to the Byzantines, hoping that this would stem the tide of Turkish emigration into Thrace.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> However, the Turks had by now firmly established themselves in Thrace. Amadeo and John spent much time between 1367 and 1369 thinking of ways to stave off defeat. Amadeo returned to Europe via Rome and brought with him Byzantine envoys. The Pope again was uninterested, but called for John V to visit him.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> In 1369, when the Ottomans finally captured Adrianople (though some sources indicate 1365),<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> John V rushed to Rome and confessed his Catholic faith both privately and at a public spectacle.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/>\n\nNevertheless, in 1371 John V returned empty-handed, having humiliated himself and done nothing to improve the deteriorating situation in the Balkans.\n\n===Ottoman vassalage of John V===\nIn 1371, the Serbs mustered their strength and prepared to launch an attack to drive back the Turks from Thrace. In a crushing victory, the Ottomans annihilated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]],<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/> and in its aftermath, many surviving lords submitted to the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]]. Byzantium was in no better position and after taking [[Serres]] from the defeated Serbs, John V swore allegiance as a vassal to Murad.<ref name=\"Cyril269\"/><ref name=\"Cyril270\">Mango, p. 270</ref>\n\n==Third Palaiologan Civil War, 1373\u20131394==\n{{main|Byzantine civil war of 1373\u20131379}}\n{{History of the Byzantine Empire}}\nJohn V's rule was an unhappy one, resulting in his vassalage to Murad I. However, it must have been all the more worse when his eldest son and heir to the throne [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]] rebelled against his father in 1373.<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> Curiously, this rebellion coincided with the rebellion of Murad I's son, [[Savci Celebi]]<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> and the two worked towards fomenting revolution in their peoples. Consequently, both the Byzantine and Ottoman rulers were facing their sons and as a result, coordinated efforts were made to defeat both.<ref name=\"Cyril270\"/> John V had his eldest son, Andronikos IV, along with the latter's son, John VII, partially blinded, while Murad I defeated his son, Savci, and had him executed.<ref name=\"Cyril271\">Mango, p. 271</ref> [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel]], the second son of John V, was made co-emperor and heir to the throne.\n\nUnfortunately for John V, Andronikos IV and his son John VII escaped. With Genoan and Turkish aid, they returned to Constantinople and succeeded in overthrowing John V, imprisoning him and Manuel.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> In exchange for Ottoman aid, Andronikos IV handed the fortress of [[Gallipoli]] over to the Ottomans, thus rendering the only genuine European aid, provided by [[Amadeo, Prince of Achaea|Amadeo]] of [[Savoy]], useless. Again, prison break became the next event with John V and Manuel escaping Constantinople, offering the Ottoman Sultan higher tribute than normally paid, in return for help in taking over Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> Andronikos IV, having been beaten yet again, evaded capture and slipped into the Genoese district of [[Galata]] with his family and hostages. John V, only interested in securing his throne and stability, came to conclude a pact with Andronikos IV in 1381, recognizing him as heir with John VII as heir apparent,<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> thus removing Manuel from the line of succession.\n\nNaturally, Manuel felt betrayed by this move which demoted him from co-emperor. Returning to Thessalonica in 1382, he rebelled and established his rule over [[Thessaly]] and Epirus, thus \"expanding\" the Empire, at least nominally, and thereby catching the Ottoman Sultan's attention.<ref name=\"Cyril271\"/> Murad I besieged Thessalonica in 1383, beginning a siege that would last until 1387. Meanwhile, Andronikos IV died and his son, John VII, began quarreling with his grandfather, John V.\n\nWith Thessalonica surrendering in 1387 and his position rather hopeless, Manuel returned to John V and, with the Sultan's assent, began making conciliatory offers to his father.<ref name=\"Cyril272\">Mango, p. 272</ref> John V realized that accepting his second son back would cause his grandson to rebel in turn, and therefore he simply kept Manuel in exile in [[Lemnos]].<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> Eventually, John VII did rebel against his grandfather \u2014 news of Manuel's arrival at Constantinople and John V's reconciliation talks with him prompted John VII to head to [[Genoa]] and then to the new Ottoman Sultan, [[Bayezid the Thunderbolt]], to seek aid in order to topple John V.\n\nJohn VII's rebellion succeeded initially, taking Constantinople from John V,<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> but Manuel countered by rousing the rest of the empire and its few remaining military assets and turned them against John VII. Manuel also received aid from the [[Knights of St. John]] stationed at [[Rhodes]], where he \"donated\" religious relics made of precious metals to them for their support.<ref name=\"Cyril272\"/> John refused to give up his right to rule as Emperor of Byzantium until his death in 1408. By then however, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid had recognized Manuel II Palaiologos as co-emperor of Byzantium alongside his father John V, and finally, when John V died in 1391, as sole Emperor.<ref name=\"Cyril273\">Mango, p. 273</ref>\n\n==Manuel II Palaiologos, 1391\u20131420==\n{{details|Manuel II Palaiologos}}\n\n[[File:1389 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Byzantium in 1389.<ref>Mango, p. 264</ref> Thrace was lost in the previous three decades.]]\n\nManuel II's reign saw another temporary respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, he succeeded in retaking some territory and held it to the end of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he lived long enough to see his son undo much of his achievements.\n\n===Vassalage to 1394===\nManuel II's first priority was to establish an agreement with [[Bayezid I]]. John VII was a favorite of Bayezid so Manuel II was in a dangerous position. He eventually sealed an agreement. However, the Ottoman Sultan became infuriated by Manuel II's attempts to reconcile his nephew John VII.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/> Manuel was concerned that John VII might once again launch a coup against him so wished to end the threat diplomatically. Bayezid ordered Manuel's execution, but then reduced his furious response and instead demanded that Constantinople build another Mosque and that a colony of Turks be established.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/>\n\n===Rebellion; Byzantium survives, 1394\u20131402===\nManuel's next steps were bold and seemingly foolish \u2014 not only did he refuse to pay the Sultan tribute, he refused to answer the Sultan's messages and Bayezid set about laying siege to Constantinople.<ref name=\"Cyril273\"/> In 1394, his siege began and would continue for eight years. Manuel II realized that while the City could endure a half-hearted blockade, it did not have the military assets to man the [[walls of Constantinople]]. At first, the situation was not so dire \u2014 a massive counter-attack by the West was to be launched as the Crusade of Nicopolis.<ref name=\"Cyril274\">Mango, p. 274</ref> In a [[Battle of Nicopolis|titanic battle]], Bayezid force-marched his army to a stunning yet costly victory. Thousands were killed, but now Bayezid was able to turn his armies fully against Constantinople.\n\nThe situation was dire; so much so that John VII, Manuel's dire opponent, was left in charge of Constantinople. He made one grand tour of Europe in 1399, stopping at [[Venice]], [[Padua]], [[Milan]], Paris and London, where he met the English [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]; in England, he was well received<ref name=\"Cyril274\"/> and treated to a jousting tournament. However, Manuel was unable to secure any help from Western Christendom.\n\nIn the end, it would be Eastern Islam that would come to Constantinople's aid \u2014 [[Timur]], the Khan of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] Mongols led his army deep into Anatolia, [[Battle of Ankara|decisively defeating]] Bayezid and his exhausted army in 1402 near Ankara. The defeat caused a panic amongst the Turks in Anatolia, who frantically began crossing over to Europe, albeit with hired Byzantine ships.\n\nManuel, who was still in Europe, arrived in 1403 to a welcoming sight \u2014 Constantinople free from Ottoman siege. John VII remained loyal, handing back the capital and even taking [[Thessalonica]] back from the Ottomans.\n\n===Ottoman Interregnum, 1402\u201313===\n[[File:Manuel II Paleologus.jpg|right|thumb|Manuel II lived to 75 years of age]]\nThe [[Ottoman Interregnum|defeat of the Ottomans]] considerably changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that only a short time had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, [[S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi|S\u00fcleyman]] who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained [[Mount Athos]] and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to [[Varna]]. As an added bonus, Imperial authority was asserted over a number of [[Aegean Islands]]. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.\n\nBayezid's sons lost no time fighting each other for their father's shattered realm. By 1413, [[Mehmed I]] had emerged as the victor. However, the Byzantines had made sure to support the victor and Mehmed I did not forget the kindness of the Byzantines and was able to \"control\" his Turk subjects from expanding into Byzantine territory.\n\n===Resumption of hostilities===\nManuel II Palaiologos was 70 years of age in 1421 and believed that the time had come for him to retire and give his eldest son, John VIII, the opportunity to rule with a more aggressive manner than he had done so. At the same time, a far less restrained [[Murad II]], son of Mehmed I, came to the Ottoman throne in May of that year. With two men uninterested in diplomacy on the thrones of Byzantium and the Ottoman Sultanate, [[Byzantine-Ottoman Wars|war]] was inevitable.\n\nThe Byzantines were the first to make a move when John VIII and his advisors made a risky decision by inciting a rebellion within the Ottoman Sultanate. In August 1421, they backed a man named Mustafa who claimed to be a long lost son of Bayezid the Thunderbolt. In Europe, Mustafa's rebellion worked well and he gathered some support. However, in August 1422, Murad II had this rebellion crushed and Mustafa received the traditional execution (hanging) shortly after, something any rebel would have expected. Murad II was enraged and had an [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|army sent to Constantinople]] and [[Siege of Thessalonika (1422)|to Thessalonika]], the latter falling in 1430. Murad II was unable to take Constantinople by force. Nonetheless, the situation in the Capital was dire enough for Manuel II to come out of retirement and incite yet another rebellion in Asia Minor under Murad II's brother, [[Kucuk Mustafa]]. Initial rebel success, including a siege of Bursa was too much for Murad II to ignore so the siege of Constantinople was lifted to deal with this threat, and to the Byzantines' greatest despair, dealt with it indeed.\n\nManuel II was now out of tricks to save the erroneous rule of his son, John VIII. In September 1423, Thessalonika was surrendered to the Venetians, no doubt hoping to draw in the Western Powers into crusading mode and, if not, at least their wealth would enable them to defend it better. In February 1424, Manuel II Palaiologos re-established Byzantium as a vassal of the Ottomans \u2014 300,000 silver coins were to be paid to the Sultan on annual basis. That the Empire managed to accomplish this at its lowest ebb is remarkable. Nonetheless until the 1450s, the Ottomans would not make any concerted efforts to overcome the walls of Constantinople, and the city retained a tenuous security for the next two decades.\n\n== John VIII takes over ==\n{{details|John VIII Palaiologos}}\n[[File:National gallery in washington d.c., pisanello, medaglia di giovanni di bisanzio recto.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[Medal of the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos]] during his visit to Florence, by [[Pisanello]] (1438). The legend reads, in Greek: \"John the Palaiologos, ''[[basileus]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'' of the Romans\".]]\n\nManuel II's final years saw his gains wasted and the Empire ''status quo ante'' 1391. John VIII was still hopeful that he could emulate his Father's success and more. Like his predecessors, his attempts were in vain. And just like his predecessors, he relied too heavily on a Pope not willingly to give, only take; take that is, the Church of a wretched state surrounded by the Ottomans, soon-to-be Christendom's direst foe.\n\n===Union with Rome===\nUniting the Church of Byzantium with that of Rome was a simple matter, since all the bargaining chips were in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic]] West. John VIII, as the ''de facto'' head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the [[Filioque clause|Filioque]] dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in [[Ferrara]] and [[Florence]], not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.\n\n=== Varna ===\nIn the late 1440s, the Ottomans experienced difficulty in bringing their Christian vassals in the Balkans into line. [[Hungary]] began launching successful campaigns against the Turks in Serbia, leading to the Serbian Despot and the Albanian resistance leader [[Skanderbeg|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] into direct opposition with their former masters. This led to one of the last great Crusades of a united Western Christendom \u2014 [[Crusade of Varna]]. Murad II was in no position to stop these troublesome westerners since he was overwhelmed with problems by easterners in Anatolia, the core of the Ottoman realm. Therefore, Murad hastily concluded a peace treaty in the Balkans. The Hungarians soon broke the treaty, but at Varna a hastily assembled Ottoman army crushed the Crusaders and left the Balkans at the mercy of Ottoman vengeance.\n\nJohn VIII died in 1448. His reign lasted two decades. His achievement was the continued survival of the Empire. Yet Byzantium was now hanging by a thread. With insufficient military manpower for its own defense, an economy ruined by years of warfare, a depopulated capital, and insufficient territory to provide a basis for recovery, the Empire's position was becoming untenable. John was severely constrained by his circumstances, and proved unable to improve the fortunes of the state. He was succeeded by his brother [[Constantine XI]]. The new emperor would be Byzantium's last sovereign ruler.\n\n== Constantine XI ==\n{{details|Constantine XI}}\nConstantine's reign was short; from 1448 (some sources say 1449) until 1453. Constantine XI, like many of his predecessors who took the Union between Eastern and Western Christendom seriously, lived as a Catholic. Not much is known of his reign, except that he died with his soldiers in the final fight for Constantinople.\n\n===Defiance, defence and defeat===\n[[File:Constantine Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine XI depicted in semi-classical armour.]]\n{{main|Fall of Constantinople}}\nConstantine XI was the [[Despot of the Morea]] before his ascension to the throne. From this position, he had continued the aggressive policies of his father and his brothers against the Ottomans and their vassals, the [[Duchy of Athens]], but had been forced to back down by [[Murad II]]. In 1451, [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father Murad. Upon his succession to the throne, he received a demand by Constantine XI for subsidies, coupled with a threat to rebel if these were not met. Mehmed II responded with these bold declarations by building a [[Rumelihisar\u0131|fortress]] on the European side of the Bosporus in order to better control traffic through the Bosporus.\n\nMehmed II assembled a huge army to assail Constantinople's landward walls \u2014 some sources suggest 80,000 soldiers, while others suggest figures as high as 100,000 or even 200,000, including camp followers. A major feature of the Ottoman army was its high-quality artillery. Among others, it featured a number of \"super-cannons\" built by [[Orban]], a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] engineer who had originally offered his services to Constantine, who rejected them for lack of money.<ref name=\"Runciman 79-80\">{{cite book|last = Runciman|first = Steven|authorlink=Steven Runciman|year = 1990|title = The Fall of Constantinople, 1453|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0-521-39832-9|pages=79\u201380}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicolle 13\">{{cite book|last = Nicolle|first = David|authorlink=David Nicolle|year = 2000|title = Constantinople 1453: The end of Byzantium|publisher = Osprey Publishing|isbn = 1-84176-091-9|page=13}}</ref> After the rejection of terms of surrender by Constantine, the siege began on April 2, 1453, with Ottoman cannon firing from April 6. The defenders were few, but the mighty walls allowed them to withstand the siege for some time. Finally however, on May 29, the Ottomans achieved a breach, and the city fell. Constantine XI charged at the oncoming Ottoman army; the last Roman Emperor died fighting, and since his body was never recognized, is assumed to have been buried in a mass grave.\n\n===Conclusion===\nConstantine's rule is hard to assess due to the shortness of his reign. As a Despot, he had shown ability, but the fall of the Empire to the Turks was by his time inevitable, no matter how able and energetic an Emperor sat on the throne. What is most remembered of him is the stubborn defence of his city against the odds, and his death in battle, through which he entered popular legend. Despite his Catholic confession, he is viewed as a saint by many [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and many legends were created about the ultimate fate of the last Constantine.\n\n==Learning under the Palaiologoi==\n===Second Byzantine/Palaiologan Renaissance===\n{{details|Renaissance}}\nDespite much chaos in the Empire, the Byzantines experienced a revival in culture and art within their domain. Towards the 14th century, as the Empire entered into a phase of terminal crisis, such achievements became less valued. All was not lost for these seemingly rejected scholars \u2014 many in Italy who had been opened up to Byzantium by the maritime expansions of Genoa and Venice came to appreciate their achievements, facilitating the Renaissance. As such these scholars found themselves in Italian institutions, expressing their Greco-Roman culture for pay. Immigration to Italy was made less attractive by the idea of abandoning the Orthodox faith to practice Catholicism. Nonetheless, a significant and increasing number of Greeks began travelling to Italy, first temporarily to Italian colonies such as [[Crete]] or [[Cyprus]] before returning to Byzantium, then as the Empire began to fail horribly, in more permanent manner. The Fall of Constantinople was marked by large numbers of Greek refugees escaping Turkic rule into Europe via Italy and thus accelerating the Renaissance.\n\n===Restoration of the Classics<!--linked from 'Scholia'-->===\n[[File:Dionysos satyr Altemps Inv8606.jpg|thumb|right|Classical literature that was studied included mythical figures such as Dionysus.]]\nThe Fourth Crusade saw the destruction of many homes in Constantinople and much of the city on fire. It is difficult to determine what books were burned in the libraries of Constantinople, though one can only imagine that few would be available today were it not for the works of [[Demetrius Triclinius]], [[Manuel Moschopoulos]], [[Thomas Magister]] and [[Maximos Planudes]]. New editions of poets, such as Hesiod and Pindar, were made and their metric systems were reconstructed with competence. They wrote about such works as [[Scholia]] and [[Pindar]]. Countless works are also included, such as the [[Sophocles|tragedians of Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], Ptolemy's ''Geography'', Nonnus of Panaopolis' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', edits and \"rediscoveries\" on [[Plutarch]] and the Greek Anthology of epigrams. Works assembled by [[Theodore Metochites]] at the Monastery of [[Chora Church|Chora]] can be found in the libraries of [[Istanbul]], [[Oxford]], the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and even Paris.\n\n===Greek Byzantium===\nIn the past, at its full height, the Byzantine Empire was composed of many territories, [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty|stretching from modern-day Iraq to modern-day Spain]]. As the Empire's borders shrunk, so too had its cultural diversity. By the late 13th century, the Empire consisted almost exclusively of traditionally Greek territory (inhabited by Greeks since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]). Consequently, this Greek culture soon came to dominate the Empire and the works of the Classical age such as those of [[Sophocles]] and [[Theocritus]] were meticulously copied and annotated.\n\nNotable philosophers include [[Planudes]] who characterized the interest in Science and Mathematics at the time. Astronomy was also a field of interest, as [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] illustrates with his proposal to modify the calendar before changes were put in place by the Gregorian reform.\n\nMoreover, some prominent personalities also proposed the change of the Imperial title to 'Emperor of the [[Hellenes]]', instead of Romans. This enthusiasm for the glorious past, contained elements that were also present in the movement that led to the creation of the modern [[Greece|Greek]] state, in 1830, after four centuries of Ottoman rule.<ref>Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasiliev [https://books.google.com/books?id=2X8LtjDLNl8C&pg=PA582 History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, Vol. 2]. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1952, {{ISBN|9780299809263}}, p. 582</ref>\n\n===Persian science enters, circa 1300===\nAt the time, [[astrologist]]s had to rely on [[Ptolemy]]'s tables for calculations. However, these proved to be inaccurate when compared to Arab [[astronomy]]. As a result, Persian tables were used more often, even if in conjunction with Ptolemy's. The acceptance of Arab astronomy was made harder by the fact that it had to be translated, and only entered through \"lowlier social channels\", namely by men who travelled between Constantinople and [[Trabzon|Trebizond]]. Such men included [[Gregory Choniades]] and his follower [[George Chrysokokkes]], who acquainted themselves with this science. By the mid 14th century, when Byzantium was overwhelmed with troubles, the tables of Ptolemy were deemed by professionals as inadequate and slowly abandoned for Persian tables.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nDespite this, Persian works such as those on [[astrolabe]] were translated into Greek as early as 1309. In 1352, [[Theodore Metochites]] published his thoughts using Persian and Ptolemaic tables.\n\nSuch works, while being non-Christian and in many cases non-Hellenistic, were cultivated by the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastics. Both Choniades and Metochites established themselves in the Greek Orthodox Church; the former becoming Bishop of [[Tabriz]] and the latter the head of the Patriarchal school.\n[[File:Tempio malatestiano.jpg|thumb|left|Plethon's final resting place was moved to the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], [[Italy]] by his Italian disciples.]]\nNot all thinkers were welcome in Byzantium. Some who opened their minds to other beliefs would have strayed from the \"[[one true Religion]]\", as the Byzantines would have seen it. One such example is that of [[Plethon]]. His works on computational astronomy using Hebrew and Persian tables were overshadowed by the neo-pagan beliefs he adopted in his old age. He proclaimed his belief in the \"Seven Wise Men\", the message of [[Zoroaster]] and [[Fatalism]]. Consequently, his work on a modified Greek Pantheon, ''The Laws'' was burnt by the Patriarch of Constantinople. Plethon's ashes repose in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] of [[Rimini]].\n\nOthers went so far as to suggest that Byzantium would not live forever \u2014 a fundamental belief for every subject of the Byzantine Orthodox Church. Metochites did not see Byzantine civilization as superior to others and even considered the \"[[infidel]]\" [[Tatars]] as more enlightened in some aspects, such as morality, than his Christian co-religionists.\n\n===Patronage===\nPhilosophers had to find ways of bringing food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally-based or, earlier in the Empire, trade-based. In contrast, philosophers needed [[patronage]] in order to survive. The most important source was from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the wealthy, and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy, although only bishops had such resources.\n\nAs the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances in its efforts to defend its borders. Study in the fields of science and mathematics naturally disappeared from the minds of those whose lands were raided and seized. It was due to this lack of patronage that led many scholars to flee to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by [[John Argyropoulos]], [[Constance]], [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], who between them had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. The end of the Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance.\n\n== Conclusion ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe end of the Byzantine Empire did not seem inevitable to contemporaries. As late as 1444, a mere nine years before the [[Fall of Constantinople]], there were high hopes that the Turks would be driven out of Europe. The Byzantines that pinned their dreams of restoration on the West had hoped that they could reap the benefits of another \"[[First Crusade]]\" that would cut a swathe through Asia Minor and allow Byzantine troops to re-occupy the empire's ancient heartlands. However, by the late 14th century, the Byzantine Empire did not possess sufficient resources for the task, and in any case such Western undertakings would have required Byzantium to submit to Rome. If the price for political freedom was religious freedom, certain emperors such as [[Michael VIII]] were willing to pay it. In the long run though, the Byzantines were not prepared to surrender their ancient customs and beliefs willingly.\n\nThe proximate cause of the problem lay in Byzantium's numerous enemies, who combined during the course of the 14th century to overwhelm what remained of the empire's core territories. With each passing decade, the Byzantine Empire became weaker and lost more land. There were fewer resources available to deal with the Empire's opponents. Her power base was consequently ruined. While the empire had experienced difficulties before (in the 8th century much of Byzantium's lands were occupied by [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and Arabs), by the later 14th century the empire no longer possessed any significant territories (such as Asia Minor) to form the basis of a recovery. As a result, many attempts at driving back the Ottomans and Bulgarians failed, while the lack of territory, revenue and manpower meant that Byzantium's armies became increasingly obsolete and outnumbered.\n\nHowever, the most serious problems arose from the internal political and military organisation of the empire. The empire's political system, based as it was around an autocratic and semi-divine emperor who exercised absolute power, had become obsolete, while the civil wars the system produced severely weakened the empire from within, leaving it disastrously exposed to outside attack. Furthermore, the empire's military system had become increasingly disorganised and chaotic, following the demise of the theme system in the 11th\u201313th centuries. The result was persistent failure and defeat on every frontier.\n\nByzantium could only lose and decline for so long before it destroyed her; by the late 14th century, the situation had become so severe that Byzantium surrendered her political independence. By the mid 15th century, restoring both the religious and the political freedom of Byzantium was ultimately an impossible cause.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Family trees of the Byzantine imperial dynasties]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Justinian Dynasty]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Heraclian]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Isaurians]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Macedonians]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Doukids]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Komnenoi]]\n* [[Byzantium under the Angeloi]]\n* [[Despotate of the Morea]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Madden, Thomas F.

An arsenal had been created within the Akal Takht over a period of several months. Trucks engaged for [[kar seva]] (religious service) and bringing in supplies for the daily langar were smuggling in guns and ammunition. The police never attempted to check these vehicles entering the Golden Temple, reportedly on instructions from superiors. During a random check one such truck was stopped and many [[sten]] guns and ammunition were found. After Operation Blue Star it was found that the militants had set up a grenade manufacturing facility, and a workshop for the fabrication of sten-guns inside the Temple Complex.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/>\n\nThe Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified under the guidance of Major General [[Shabeg Singh]], who had joined Bhindranwale's group after dismissal from the army. During their occupation of Akal Takht, Bhindranwale's group had begun fortifying the building, which had allegedly disfigured the Akal Takht. ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' reported that [[light machine gun]]s and [[semi-automatic rifle]]s were known to have been brought into the compound,<ref>Kuldip Nayar and Khushwant Singh, ''Tragedy of Punjab'', Vision Books, New Delhi, 1984, p. 79.</ref> and strategically placed to defend against an armed assault on the complex.

The heavier weapons were found to have Pakistani or Chinese markings on them.<ref name=\"weapons\">{{cite news |title=Operation Bluestar |publisher=India Today |date=1999}}</ref>\n\nHoles were smashed through the marble walls of Akal takht to create gun positions. Walls were broken to allow entry points from the basements in the Takht and from the rooms around the Parikrama, to the tiled courtyards. Secure machine gun nests were created. All of these positions were protected by sandbags and newly made brick walls. The windows and arches of Akal Takht were blocked with bricks and sandbags. Sandbags were placed on the turrets. The entire Akal Takht had been converted into a large reinforced pillbox with weapons pointing in all directions. Every strategically significant building of the temple complex, apart from the Harmandir Sahib located at its very centre, had been fortified in a similar manner and allegedly defaced. The fortifications also included seventeen private houses in the residential area near the Temple.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/> All the high rise buildings and towers near the temple complex were occupied.

This was to avoid the 'desecration' of the temple by their presence. The security forces were prevented by the politicians from taking action in enforcing the law. Even self-defence from the militants was made difficult. On 14 February 1984, a police post near the entrance of the Temple was attacked by a group of militants. Six fully armed policemen were captured and taken inside. After twenty four hours the police responded and sent in a senior police officer for negotiation. He asked Bhindranwale in the Akal Takht to release his men and return their weapons. Bhindranwale agreed only to return the corpse of one of the policemen who had been killed.

The buildings were close together and had labyrinthine passages all under the control of the militants. Militants in the temple premises had access to langars, food supplies, and water from the Sarovar (temple pond). Militants were well stocked with weapons and ammunitions. Any siege under these circumstances would have been long and difficult. The option of laying down a long siege was ruled out by the army due to the risk of emotionally aroused villagers marching to the temple and clashing with the army.

The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. Twenty-six Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai. Twelve Bihar was charged with providing a cordon and fire support to the other regiments by neutralising enemy positions under their observance.<ref>Brar, K.S. (1992). ''Operation Blue Star: True Story''. UBS Publishers Distributors (P), Limited. pmp. 61. {{ISBN|81-7476-068-7}}.</ref>\n\nAn initial attempt by the commandos to gain a foothold at Darshani Deori failed as they came under devastating fire, after which several further attempts were made with varying degrees of success. Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex.\n\nCrawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 commandos. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side.\n\nDespite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool).\n\nBrigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As one APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support. The tanks received the clearance to fire their main guns (105&nbsp;mm [[high-explosive squash head]] shells) only at around 7:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brar|first=K.S.|date=1992|title=Operation Blue Star: True Story|publisher=UBS Publishers Distributors (P) Limited|pages=81\u2013110|isbn=978-81-7476-068-5}}</ref>\n\n=== 6 June ===\n[[File:AB133 - Vijayanta MBT.JPG|thumb|The army used seven [[Vijayanta|Vijayanta Tanks]] during the operation<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Singh\n | first = Sangat\n | title = The Sikhs in History\n | publisher = Uncommon Books\n | year = 1992\n | page = 378\n | isbn = 978-81-900650-0-9 }}</ref>]]\nVijayanta tanks shelled the Akal Takht.

An arsenal had been created within the Akal Takht over a period of several months. Trucks engaged for [[kar seva]] (religious service) and bringing in supplies for the daily langar were smuggling in guns and ammunition. The police never attempted to check these vehicles entering the Golden Temple, reportedly on instructions from superiors. During a random check one such truck was stopped and many [[sten]] guns and ammunition were found. After Operation Blue Star it was found that the militants had set up a grenade manufacturing facility, and a workshop for the fabrication of sten-guns inside the Temple Complex.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/>\n\nThe Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified under the guidance of Major General [[Shabeg Singh]], who had joined Bhindranwale's group after dismissal from the army. During their occupation of Akal Takht, Bhindranwale's group had begun fortifying the building, which had allegedly disfigured the Akal Takht. ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' reported that [[light machine gun]]s and [[semi-automatic rifle]]s were known to have been brought into the compound,<ref>Kuldip Nayar and Khushwant Singh, ''Tragedy of Punjab'', Vision Books, New Delhi, 1984, p. 79.</ref> and strategically placed to defend against an armed assault on the complex. The modern weapons later found inside the temple complex indicated that foreign elements were involved. The heavier weapons were found to have Pakistani or Chinese markings on them.<ref name=\"weapons\">{{cite news |title=Operation Bluestar |publisher=India Today |date=1999}}</ref>\n\nHoles were smashed through the marble walls of Akal takht to create gun positions. Walls were broken to allow entry points from the basements in the Takht and from the rooms around the Parikrama, to the tiled courtyards. Secure machine gun nests were created. All of these positions were protected by sandbags and newly made brick walls. The windows and arches of Akal Takht were blocked with bricks and sandbags. Sandbags were placed on the turrets. The entire Akal Takht had been converted into a large reinforced pillbox with weapons pointing in all directions. Every strategically significant building of the temple complex, apart from the Harmandir Sahib located at its very centre, had been fortified in a similar manner and allegedly defaced. The fortifications also included seventeen private houses in the residential area near the Temple.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/> All the high rise buildings and towers near the temple complex were occupied.

The defences in the complex were created with the purpose of holding out long enough to provoke an uprising among Sikhs in the villages and encourage them to march en masse towards the Golden Temple in support of the militants.

This was to avoid the 'desecration' of the temple by their presence. The security forces were prevented by the politicians from taking action in enforcing the law. Even self-defence from the militants was made difficult. On 14 February 1984, a police post near the entrance of the Temple was attacked by a group of militants. Six fully armed policemen were captured and taken inside. After twenty four hours the police responded and sent in a senior police officer for negotiation. He asked Bhindranwale in the Akal Takht to release his men and return their weapons. Bhindranwale agreed only to return the corpse of one of the policemen who had been killed. Later the remaining five policemen who were still alive were also released, but their weapons, including three sten guns and a wireless set, were not returned.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/><ref name= ms_policepost>{{cite book | last =Mark Tully | first = Satish Jacob | title = Amritsar; Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle | url =https://archive.org/details/amritsarmrsgandh00tull | url-access =registration | year = 1985 | location = London|edition = e-book }}</ref>\n\nThe fortifications of the temple denied the army the possibility of commando operations. The buildings were close together and had labyrinthine passages all under the control of the militants. Militants in the temple premises had access to langars, food supplies, and water from the Sarovar (temple pond). Militants were well stocked with weapons and ammunitions. Any siege under these circumstances would have been long and difficult. The option of laying down a long siege was ruled out by the army due to the risk of emotionally aroused villagers marching to the temple and clashing with the army.

Ten Guards, 1 Para Commandos and [[Special Frontier Force]] (SFF) would attack from the main entrance of the complex, and 26 Madras and 9 Kumaon battalions from the hostel complex side entrance from the south. The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. Twenty-six Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai. Twelve Bihar was charged with providing a cordon and fire support to the other regiments by neutralising enemy positions under their observance.<ref>Brar, K.S. (1992).

Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex.\n\nCrawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 commandos. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side.\n\nDespite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool).\n\nBrigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As one APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support.

The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange [[thermal energy]] in either [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat|latent]] form.\n\nIn some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either diurnal [[thermal energy storage]] or [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is [[waste heat]] from [[air conditioning]] machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time [[heating]]. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later.<ref>Andersson, O.; H\u00e4gg, M.

March 16 and 17, 1998</ref>\n\n==Principle==\nA common application of this principle is in systems which have an ''exhaust stream'' or ''waste stream'' which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often [[gas]]eous or [[liquid]]) may be transferred to the ''make-up'' or ''input'' material flow. This ''input'' [[mass]] flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the ''waste stream''. This temperature differential allows [[heat transfer]] and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to ''fresh'' ''make-up'' [[air]] and [[water]] intakes in [[buildings]], such as for the [[HVAC]] systems, or process systems.\n\n==System approach==\n[[Energy consumption]] is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves [[energy conversion|converting one energy system to another]], for example: The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers, light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process.\n\nAn energy recovery system will close this [[Conservation of energy|energy cycle]] to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work.\n\n==Examples==\n* Heat recovery is implemented in heat sources like e.g. a [[steel mill]]. Heated [[cooling water]] from the process is sold for heating of homes, shops and offices in the surrounding area.\n* [https://www.prometheanenergy.com/ Waste Heat Recovery Devices | Promethean Energy]\n* [[Regenerative braking]] is used in electric cars, trains, heavy cranes etc. where the energy consumed when elevating the potential is returned to the electric supplier when released.\n* Active pressure reduction systems where the differential pressure in a pressurized fluid flow is recovered rather than converted to heat in a pressure reduction valve and released.\n* [[Energy recovery ventilation]]\n* [[Energy recycling]]\n* [[Water heat recycling]]\n* [[Heat recovery ventilation]]\n* [[Heat recovery steam generator]]\n* [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine]]<ref>[http://www.cyclonepower.com/ Cyclone Power Technologies Website]</ref>\n* [[Hydrogen turboexpander-generator]]\n* [[Thermal diode]]\n* [[Thermal oxidizer]]\n* [[Thermoelectric Modules]]\n* [[Waste heat recovery unit]]s\n\n=== Electric Turbo Compound (ETC) ===\n[[File:TG_cross_section.jpg|thumb|[[Electric turbo compound|Electric Turbo Compound (ETC)]] cross section]]\n{{Main|Electric turbo compound}}\nElectric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases.\n\n==Environmental impact==\nThere is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with [[energy conservation]], it should be possible to dramatically reduce [[world energy consumption]].

The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange [[thermal energy]] in either [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat|latent]] form.\n\nIn some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either diurnal [[thermal energy storage]] or [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is [[waste heat]] from [[air conditioning]] machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time [[heating]]. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later.<ref>Andersson, O.; H\u00e4gg, M.

March 16 and 17, 1998</ref>\n\n==Principle==\nA common application of this principle is in systems which have an ''exhaust stream'' or ''waste stream'' which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often [[gas]]eous or [[liquid]]) may be transferred to the ''make-up'' or ''input'' material flow. This ''input'' [[mass]] flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the ''waste stream''. This temperature differential allows [[heat transfer]] and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to ''fresh'' ''make-up'' [[air]] and [[water]] intakes in [[buildings]], such as for the [[HVAC]] systems, or process systems.\n\n==System approach==\n[[Energy consumption]] is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves [[energy conversion|converting one energy system to another]], for example: The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers, light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process.\n\nAn energy recovery system will close this [[Conservation of energy|energy cycle]] to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work.\n\n==Examples==\n* Heat recovery is implemented in heat sources like e.g. a [[steel mill]]. Heated [[cooling water]] from the process is sold for heating of homes, shops and offices in the surrounding area.\n* [[Regenerative braking]] is used in electric cars, trains, heavy cranes etc. where the energy consumed when elevating the potential is returned to the electric supplier when released.\n* Active pressure reduction systems where the differential pressure in a pressurized fluid flow is recovered rather than converted to heat in a pressure reduction valve and released.\n* [[Energy recovery ventilation]]\n* [[Energy recycling]]\n* [[Water heat recycling]]\n* [[Heat recovery ventilation]]\n* [[Heat recovery steam generator]]\n* [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine]]<ref>[http://www.cyclonepower.com/ Cyclone Power Technologies Website]</ref>\n* [[Hydrogen turboexpander-generator]]\n* [[Thermal diode]]\n* [[Thermal oxidizer]]\n* [[Thermoelectric Modules]]\n* [[Waste heat recovery unit]]s\n\n=== Electric Turbo Compound (ETC) ===\n[[File:TG_cross_section.jpg|thumb|[[Electric turbo compound|Electric Turbo Compound (ETC)]] cross section]]\n{{Main|Electric turbo compound}}\nElectric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases.\n\n==Environmental impact==\nThere is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with [[energy conservation]], it should be possible to dramatically reduce [[world energy consumption]]. The effect of this will then be:\n\n* Reduced number of [[coal power plant|coal-fired power plants]]\n* Reduced airborne particles, [[NOx]] and [[CO2]] \u2013 improved air quality\n* Slowing or reducing [[climate change]]\n* Lower fuel bills on transport\n* Longer availability of [[crude oil]]\n* Change of industries and economies not fully researched\n\nIn 2008 [[Tom Casten]], chairman of [[Recycled Energy Development]], said that \"''We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.''\"<ref name=npr2008may22>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90714692 'Recycling' Energy Seen Saving Companies Money].

Blue-flowered species predominate in the Northern Hemisphere, with red-flowered species dominant in the [[Andes]], where [[Ornithophily|bird pollination]] is probably more often favored by natural selection. White-flowered species are scattered throughout the range of the genus but dominate in New Zealand. Most flowers are pentamerous, with 5 lobes in the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] and 5 [[sepal]]s. A few species have 4 to 7 flower parts. The corolla has folds called plicae between the lobes. The [[gynoecium|style]] is short or absent. The ovary is mostly sessile and has nectary glands.\n\n===List of accepted species=== \n<ref name=PlantList>{{cite web| title=The Plant List: ''Gentiana'' L. |date=2013 |url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=gentiana |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanic Garden |access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=350px}}\n*''[[Gentiana acaulis]]'' \u2013 stemless gentian\n*''[[Gentiana affinis]]'' \u2013 pleated gentian\n*''[[Gentiana alata]]''\n*''[[Gentiana alba]]'' \u2013 plain gentian\n*''[[Gentiana albicalyx]]''\n*''[[Gentiana albomarginata]]''\n*''[[Gentiana algida]]'' \u2013 whitish gentian\n*''[[Gentiana alii]]''\n*''[[Gentiana alpina]]'' \u2013 alpine gentian\n*''[[Gentiana alsinoides]]''\n<!--*''[[Gentiana altaica]]'' \u2013 'Altai Gentian' syn.
