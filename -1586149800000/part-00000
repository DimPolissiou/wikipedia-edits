The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers. It is one of four desktop computers in the current [[Macintosh]] lineup, sitting above the consumer range [[Mac Mini]] and [[iMac (Intel-based)|iMac]], and serves as an easily-expandable alternative to the [[iMac Pro]].\n\nThe first-generation Mac Pro was announced in August 2006. It has a rectangular tower case carried over from the [[Power Mac G5]], and has similar expansion capabilities. It offered two [[Dual-Core Xeon|Dual-core]] Xeon [[Woodcrest (microprocessor)|Woodcrest]] processors. It was replaced by a dual [[Quad-Core Xeon|Quad-core]] Xeon [[Clovertown (microprocessor)|Clovertown]] model on April 4, 2007, and again on January 8, 2008 by a dual Quad-core Xeon [[Harpertown (microprocessor)|Harpertown]] model.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/04/apple.8.core.mac.pro/ |publisher=MacNN |title=Apple adds 8-core option to Mac Pro |date=April 4, 2007 |author=Electronista Staff}}</ref> The 2010 and 2012 revisions featured [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]/[[Westmere (microarchitecture)|Westmere]] architecture Intel Xeon processors.\n\nThe second-generation Mac Pro was released in December 2013. Apple states that it achieves twice the overall performance of the previous model.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/at-long-last-apple-announces-new-mac-pro-with-cylindrical-design/ | title=At long last! Apple announces new Mac Pro with cylindrical design |date=June 10, 2013 | accessdate = June 10, 2013}}</ref> It has a new cylindrical design and takes up less than one-eighth the volume of the previous model. It features up to a 12-core Xeon E5 processor, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs, and PCIe-based flash storage.  There is updated wireless communication and support for six Thunderbolt displays through the Thunderbolt 2 ports, and an HDMI port. Reviews initially were generally positive, with caveats. Due to limitations caused by the cylindrical design, Apple was unable to upgrade the second-generation Mac Pro with more powerful hardware.\n\nThe third-generation Mac Pro was released in December 2019. It returns to a tower form factor reminiscent of the Power Mac G5 2003-2005 and the first-generation 2006-2012 model, but with larger and more noticeable air cooling holes. It features up to a 28-core Xeon-W processor, eight [[PCIe]] slots, AMD [[Radeon Pro|Radeon Pro Vega]] GPUs, and replaces most data ports with [[USB-C]] and [[Thunderbolt_(interface)| Thunderbolt 3]].\n\n==1st generation (Tower)==\n[[File:Mac Pro Tower.jpg|thumb|The first generation of the Mac Pro featured an aluminium case that was similar to that of the 2003's [[Power Mac G5]], with the exception of an additional optical drive bay, and a new arrangement of [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O ports]] on both the front and the back.]]\nApple stated that an Intel-based replacement for the 2003's [[PowerPC]]-based [[Power Mac G5]] machines had been expected for some time before the Mac Pro was formally announced on August 7, 2006 at the annual [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-announcements-during-wwdc-conferences-2012-6|title=The Best Products Apple Has Ever Announced At Its Annual Summer Developers Conference|last=Smith|first=Kevin|date=2012-06-09|website=Business Insider Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> The [[iMac]], [[Mac Mini]], [[MacBook]], and [[MacBook Pro]] had moved to an Intel-based [[CPU architecture|architecture]] starting in January 2006, leaving the Power Mac G5 as the only machine in the Mac lineup still based on the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture Apple had used since 1994. Apple had dropped the term \"Power\" from the other machines in their lineup, and started using \"Pro\" on their higher-end laptop offerings. As such, the name \"Mac Pro\" was widely used before the machine was announced.<ref name=\"promacs\">{{cite web|last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url= https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2006/07/promacs.ars |title=Peering inside the aluminum ball: Woodcrest, Conroe, and the 'pro' Macs |publisher=Arstechnica |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>\nThe Mac Pro is in the [[Unix]] workstation market.<ref name=\"unix\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html|title=The Unix System&nbsp;\u2014 History and Timeline|date=January 29, 2003|publisher=Unix.org|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref> Although the high-end technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, the company has been positioning itself as a leader in [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear digital editing]] for [[high-definition video]], which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine. Additionally, the [[codec]]s used in these applications are generally [[CPU bound|processor intensive]] and highly [[thread (computer science)|threadable]], which Apple's ProRes white paper describes as scaling almost linearly with additional [[Microprocessor core|processor cores]]. Apple's previous machine aimed at this market, the Power Mac G5, has up to two dual-core processors (marketed as \"Quad-Core\"), but lacks the storage expansion capabilities of the newer design.<ref name=\"promacs\" />\n\nOriginal marketing materials for the Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 \u00d7 dual-core 2.66&nbsp;GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words \"starting at\" or \"from\" when describing the pricing, but the online US [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]] listed the \"Mac Pro at $2499\", the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66&nbsp;GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26&nbsp;GHz each.<ref name=\"usstore\">{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_pro|title=Mac Pro page at Apple's online store|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard expansion slots for [[video card|graphics adapters]] and other expansion cards.\n\nApple received criticism after an incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 [[WWDC]]. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors instead of the newer E5 series.<ref>Chris Foresman, [https://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/mac-pro-gets-minor-update-with-standard-12-core-option-no-xeon-e5/ \"Mac Pro gets minor update with standard 12-core option, no Xeon E5\"], ''ArsTechnica'', June 11, 2012</ref> The line also lacked then-current technologies like [[SATA]] III, USB 3, and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], the last of which had been added to every other Macintosh at that point.

The hard drives were mounted on individual trays (also known as \"sleds\") by captive screws. A set of four drive trays was supplied with each machine. Adding hard drives to the system did not require cables to be attached as the drive was connected to the system simply by being inserted into the corresponding drive slot. A case lock on the back of the system locked the disks trays into their positions.\nThe Mac Pro also supported [[Serial ATA]] solid-state drives ([[Solid-state drive|SSD]]) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused [[PCIe]] slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.\nThe Mac Pro was also available with an optional hardware [[RAID]] card.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/03/03Apple-Introduces-New-Mac-Pro/ |title=Apple Introduces New Mac Pro |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> With the addition of a [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controller card or SAS [[RAID]] controller card, SAS drives could be directly connected to the system's [[SATA]] ports.\nTwo optical [[drive bay]]s were provided, each with a corresponding SATA port and an [[AT Attachment|Ultra ATA/100]] port.\nThe Mac Pro had one [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] port and could support two PATA devices in the optical drive bays. It had a total of six SATA ports&nbsp;\u2013 four were connected to the system's drive bays, and two were not connected.

The first slot was double wide and intended to hold the main [[video card]], arranged with an empty area the width of a normal card beside it to leave room for the large [[Computer cooling|coolers]] modern cards often use. In most machines, one slot would be blocked by the cooler. Instead of the tiny screws typically used to fasten the cards to the case, in the Mac Pro a single \"bar\" held the cards in place, which is itself held in place by two \"captive\" [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]] that can be loosened by hand without tools and will not fall out of the case.\n\nOn the original Mac Pro introduced in August 2006, the PCIe slots can be configured individually to give more [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to devices that require it, with a total of 40 \"lanes\", or 13&nbsp;GB/s total [[throughput]]. When running [[Mac OS X]], the Mac Pro did not support [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire]],<ref name=\"sli\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_pro/faq/mac-pro-support-pc-video-cards-sli-crossfire.html|title=Does the Mac Pro support standard PC video cards?

The Early-2008 and later Mac Pros had PCIe slots hardwired as in the accompanying table.\n\n===External connectivity===\n[[File:Backside Mac Pro vs Power Mac G5.jpeg|thumb|The backs of a Power Mac G5 (left) and a Mac Pro (right) show the differences in arrangement.

[[Computer networking|Networking]] was supported with two built-in [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports. [[802.11]]&nbsp;a/b/g/n [[Wi-Fi]] support ([[AirPort Extreme]]) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, whereas in the 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. [[Bluetooth]] also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more [[PCIe]] graphics cards. More recent cards featured two [[Mini DisplayPort]] connectors and one dual-link [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card [[Video memory|graphics memory]] available.\nDigital ([[TOSLINK|TOSlink]] optical) audio and analog 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo [[mini jack]]s for sound in and out were included, the latter becoming available on both the front and back of the case.\nUnlike other Mac computers, the Mac Pro did not include an [[infrared]] receiver (required to use the [[Apple Remote]]). In [[Mac OS X Leopard]], [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] could be accessed on the Mac Pro (and other Macs) using the [[Command key|Command]] (\u2318)-[[Esc key|Escape]] [[keystroke]].\n\n===Case===\n[[File:Side Power Mac G5 - Mac Pro.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Comparison of the internals of the Power Mac G5 (left) and the Mac Pro 2006 (right)]]\nFrom 2006 through 2012, the exterior of the Mac Pro's aluminium case was very similar to that of the Power Mac G5, with the exception of an additional optical drive bay, a new arrangement of [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O ports]] on both the front and the back, and one less exhaust vent on the back. \nThe case could be opened by operating a single lever on the back, which unlocked one of the two sides of the machine, as well as the [[drive bay]]s. All of the [[expansion slot]]s for memory, PCIe cards and drives could be accessed with the side panel removed and no tools were required for installation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combonews.ru/masterskaya/2043-razbiraem-apple-macpro.html|title=\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c Apple Mac Pro|publisher=|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref>\nThe Mac Pro's [[Xeon]] processors generated much less heat than the previous dual-core [[PowerPC G5|G5s]], so the size of the internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room at the top of the [[Computer case|case]] and doubling the number of internal [[drive bay]]s. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.macworld.com/2003/09/features/powermacg5nextgeneration/|magazine=[[Macworld]]|title=PowerMac G5 review}}</ref> and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowendmac.com/newsrev/06/0825.htm|publisher=Bare Feats'|title= Bare Feats' rob-ART Morgan says:}}</ref>  The handle on and cooling air intake configuration of the [[Mac Pro#1st generation|front of the case]] has caused Macintosh enthusiasts to refer to the 1st generation as the \"[[cheese grater]]\" Mac Pro.<ref name=\"ArsTechnicaModernHackintoshes\">{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Andrew|title=Modern \"Hackintoshes\" show that Apple should probably just build a Mac tower|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/hackintoshes-keep-giving-apples-frustrated-pros-a-place-to-go/3/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=January 9, 2018|date=May 1, 2017}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===Operating systems===\nThe Mac Pro comes with [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] 1.1, a successor to Apple's use of [[Open Firmware]] and the wider industry's use of [[BIOS]].<ref name=\"uefi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefi.org/about/|title=Overview|publisher=uefi.org|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nApple's [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] provides BIOS backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations.

It supports one central processing unit (CPU) (up to a 12-core Xeon E5 [[CPU]]), four 1866&nbsp;MHz DDR3 slots, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs (up to D700 with 6&nbsp;GB [[VRAM]] each (1 GB = 1024^3 B)), and PCIe-based flash storage.  There is a 3\u00d7 [[MIMO]] antenna system for the unit's [[802.11ac]] [[WiFi]] networking interface, [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth 4.0]] to facilitate close-range wireless functions such as music transfer, keyboards, mice, tablets, speakers, security, cameras, and printers.

It also has a headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three [[4K resolution|4K display]]s. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved to make it easier for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated [[digital audio]] in/out ports, a [[SuperDrive]], DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.<ref name=\"Mac Pro specs at Apple\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs|title=Mac Pro \u2014 Tech Specs|accessdate=September 14, 2014|work=Apple.com|publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]]|location=[[Cupertino, California]]}}</ref>\n\nApple's website mentions only [[RAM]] as user-serviceable, though third party tear-downs show nearly all components can be removed and replaced.

The performance had been widely lauded, especially handling video tasks on the dual GPU units, with some reviewers noting the ability to apply dozens of filters to realtime [[4K resolution|4K resolution video]] in [[Final Cut Pro X]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcp.co/final-cut-pro/articles/1307-the-first-24-hours-with-apple-s-new-mac-pro-and-final-cut-pro-10-1|title=The first 24 hours with Apple's new Mac Pro and Final Cut Pro 10.1|first=Peter|last=Wiggins|publisher=|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref> Drive performance, connected via [[PCIe]], was also widely mentioned as a strong point. Technical reviewers praised the [[OpenCL]] API under which the machine's powerful twin GPUs and its multi-core CPU can be treated as a single pool of computing power.  However, in late 2013 through early 2014, some reviewers had noted the lack of internal expandability, second CPU, serviceability, and questioned the then-limited offerings via [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports.<ref>Dan Ackerman, [http://reviews.cnet.com/apple-mac-pro/ \"Apple's radically remained Mac Pro is a powerhouse performer\"], ''cnet'', December 20, 2013</ref><ref>Jonathan Bray, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/desktops/386710/mac-pro-late-2013 \"Mac Pro (late 2013) review\"], ''PC Pro UK'', January 24, 2014</ref> By 2016, reviewers started to agree that the Mac Pro was now lacking in functionality and power, it having not been updated since 2013, and it was past time for Apple to update it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/13/12910568/mac-pro-update-when-maybe-never|title=The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 1,000 days|last=Byford|first=Sam|newspaper=The Verge|access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Apple later revealed in 2017 that the thermal core design had limited the ability to upgrade the Mac Pro's GPUs and that a new design was under development, to be released sometime after 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=Apple to Redesign Mac Pro, Comments that GPU Cooling was a Roadblock|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11245/apple-to-redesign-mac-pro-gpu-heat-a-concern|accessdate=April 4, 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==3rd generation (Tower and USB-C)==\n<!-- https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a30170910/apple-mac-pro/ -->\n[[File:Mac Pro 2019 on wheels.jpg|thumb|3rd generation Mac Pro with wheels]]\nIn April 2018, Apple confirmed that a redesigned Mac Pro would be released in 2019 to replace the 2013 model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/|title=Apple's 2019 Mac Pro will be shaped by workflows.|website=techcrunch.com|language=en|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> Apple announced the third-generation Mac Pro on June 3, 2019 at the [[World Wide Developers Conference]].<ref>{{Cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/ | title = Apple unveils powerful, all-new Mac Pro and groundbreaking Pro Display XDR | publisher = Apple Inc. | date = June 3, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/</ref> It returns to a tower design similar to the [[Power Mac G5]] in 2003 and the first-generation model in 2006. The design also includes a new thermal architecture with three impeller fans, which promises to prevent the computer from having to throttle the processor so that it can always run at its peak performance level. The RAM memory is expandable to 1.6&nbsp;TB{{clarify|unless 1.5 TiB was intended here|date=March 2020}} using twelve 128 GB DIMMs. It can be configured with up to two [[Radeon Pro|AMD Radeon Pro]] GPUs, which come in a custom MPX module, which are fanless and use the chassis's cooling system. Apple's Afterburner card is a custom add-on, which adds hardware acceleration for [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]] codecs. Similar to the second generation, the cover can be removed to access the internals, which features eight PCIe slots for expansion, making this the first Mac with six or more expansion slots since the [[Power Macintosh 9600]] in 1997.<ref name=\"specs\" /> It can also be purchased with wheels and in a [[19-inch rack|rack mount]] configuration.

It supports one central processing unit (CPU) (up to a 12-core Xeon E5 [[CPU]]), four 1866&nbsp;MHz DDR3 slots, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs (up to D700 with 6&nbsp;GB [[VRAM]] each (1 GB = 1024^3 B)), and PCIe-based flash storage.  There is a 3\u00d7 [[MIMO]] antenna system for the unit's [[802.11ac]] [[WiFi]] networking interface, [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth 4.0]] to facilitate close-range wireless functions such as music transfer, keyboards, mice, tablets, speakers, security, cameras, and printers.

It also has a headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three [[4K resolution|4K display]]s. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved to make it easier for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated [[digital audio]] in/out ports, a [[SuperDrive]], DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.<ref name=\"Mac Pro specs at Apple\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs|title=Mac Pro \u2014 Tech Specs|accessdate=September 14, 2014|work=Apple.com|publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]]|location=[[Cupertino, California]]}}</ref>\n\nApple's website mentions only [[RAM]] as user-serviceable, though third party tear-downs show nearly all components can be removed and replaced.

Technical reviewers praised the [[OpenCL]] API under which the machine's powerful twin GPUs and its multi-core CPU can be treated as a single pool of computing power.  However, in late 2013 through early 2014, some reviewers had noted the lack of internal expandability, second CPU, serviceability, and questioned the then-limited offerings via [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports.<ref>Dan Ackerman, [http://reviews.cnet.com/apple-mac-pro/ \"Apple's radically remained Mac Pro is a powerhouse performer\"], ''cnet'', December 20, 2013</ref><ref>Jonathan Bray, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/desktops/386710/mac-pro-late-2013 \"Mac Pro (late 2013) review\"], ''PC Pro UK'', January 24, 2014</ref> By 2016, reviewers started to agree that the Mac Pro was now lacking in functionality and power, it having not been updated since 2013, and it was past time for Apple to update it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/13/12910568/mac-pro-update-when-maybe-never|title=The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 1,000 days|last=Byford|first=Sam|newspaper=The Verge|access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Apple later revealed in 2017 that the thermal core design had limited the ability to upgrade the Mac Pro's GPUs and that a new design was under development, to be released sometime after 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=Apple to Redesign Mac Pro, Comments that GPU Cooling was a Roadblock|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11245/apple-to-redesign-mac-pro-gpu-heat-a-concern|accessdate=April 4, 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==3rd generation (Tower and USB-C)==\n<!-- https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a30170910/apple-mac-pro/ -->\n[[File:Mac Pro 2019 on wheels.jpg|thumb|3rd generation Mac Pro with wheels]]\nIn April 2018, Apple confirmed that a redesigned Mac Pro would be released in 2019 to replace the 2013 model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/|title=Apple's 2019 Mac Pro will be shaped by workflows.|website=techcrunch.com|language=en|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> Apple announced the third-generation Mac Pro on June 3, 2019 at the [[World Wide Developers Conference]].<ref>{{Cite press release | url = https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/ | title = Apple unveils powerful, all-new Mac Pro and groundbreaking Pro Display XDR | publisher = Apple Inc. | date = June 3, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/</ref> It returns to a tower design similar to the [[Power Mac G5]] in 2003 and the first-generation model in 2006. The design also includes a new thermal architecture with three impeller fans, which promises to prevent the computer from having to throttle the processor so that it can always run at its peak performance level. The RAM memory is expandable to 1.6&nbsp;TB{{clarify|unless 1.5 TiB was intended here|date=March 2020}} using twelve 128 GB DIMMs. It can be configured with up to two [[Radeon Pro|AMD Radeon Pro]] GPUs, which come in a custom MPX module, which are fanless and use the chassis's cooling system. Apple's Afterburner card is a custom add-on, which adds hardware acceleration for [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]] codecs. Similar to the second generation, the cover can be removed to access the internals, which features eight PCIe slots for expansion, making this the first Mac with six or more expansion slots since the [[Power Macintosh 9600]] in 1997.<ref name=\"specs\" /> It can also be purchased with wheels and in a [[19-inch rack|rack mount]] configuration.
