{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Struck from 1817 until the present time, it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world; it is now a [[bullion coin]] and is sometimes mounted in [[jewellery]]. In most recent years, it has borne the design of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] on the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]]; the initials ({{small|B P}}) of the designer, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]], are visible to the right of the date.\n\nThe coin was named after the [[Sovereign (English coin)|English gold sovereign]], last minted about 1603, and originated as part of the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]]. Many in Parliament believed a one-pound coin should be issued rather than the 21-shilling (1.05 pounds) [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] struck until that time. The [[Master of the Mint]], [[William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington|William Wellesley Pole]], had Pistrucci design the new coin, and his depiction was also used for other gold coins. Originally, the coin was unpopular as the public preferred the convenience of banknotes, but paper currency of value \u00a31 was soon limited by law. With that competition gone, the sovereign not only became a popular circulating coin, but was used in international trade and in foreign lands, trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold.\n\nThe British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade, and the Royal Mint took steps to see that lightweight gold coins were withdrawn from circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India\u2014they have been struck again in India since 2013 (in addition to the production in Britain by the Royal Mint) for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.\n\nWith the start of the [[First World War]] in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Background and authorisation==\n[[File:Sovereign, Queen Mary, England, 1553 - Bode-Museum - DSC02751.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gold coin of medieval vintage showing a woman seated on a throne|[[Sovereign (English coin)|Sovereign]] of Queen Mary I, c. 1553]]\nThere had been an English coin known as the [[Sovereign (English coin)|sovereign]], first authorised by Henry VII in 1489. It had a diameter of {{convert|42|mm}}, and weighed {{convert|15.55|g}}, twice the weight of the existing gold coin, the [[spur ryal|ryal]]. The new coin was struck in response to a large influx of gold into Europe from West Africa in the 1480s, and Henry at first called it the double ryal, but soon changed the name to sovereign.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=61}} Too great in value to have any practical use in circulation, the original sovereign likely served as a presentation piece to be given to dignitaries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tudor sovereign|publisher=The Royal Mint Museum|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/coins/british-coinage/old-denominations/tudor-sovereign/index.html|accessdate=4 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe English sovereign, the country's first coin to be valued at one pound,{{sfn|Clancy|p=15}} was struck by the monarchs of the 16th century, the size and fineness often being altered. [[James I]], when he came to the English throne in 1603, issued a sovereign in the year of his accession,{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=3\u20134}} but the following year, soon after he proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, France{{efn|A historic claim only. See {{harvnb|Hubbard}}.}} and Ireland, he issued a proclamation for a new twenty-shilling piece. About ten per cent lighter than the final sovereigns, the new coin was called the [[unite (English coin)|unite]], symbolising that James had merged the Scottish and English crowns.{{sfn|Clancy|p=41}}\n\nIn the 1660s, following the [[Restoration of Charles II]] and the mechanisation of the [[Royal Mint]] that quickly followed, a new twenty-shilling gold coin was issued. It had no special name at first but the public soon nicknamed it the [[guinea (coin)|guinea]] and this became the accepted term.{{sfn|Clancy|p=45}} Coins were at the time valued by their precious metal content, and the price of gold relative to silver rose soon after the guinea's issuance. Thus, it came to trade at 21 [[shilling (English coin)|shillings]] or even sixpence more. Popular in commerce, the coin's value was set by the government at 21 shillings in silver in 1717, and was subject to revision downwards, though in practice this did not occur.{{sfn|Clancy|p=47}} The term sovereign, referring to a coin, fell from use\u2014it does not appear in [[Samuel Johnson's dictionary]], compiled in the 1750s.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}}\n\n[[File:\u00a31 Gloucester Old Bank note for Charles Evans & James Fell 1814.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Old piece of paper money with the inscription in script-appearing text|A \u00a31 note issued in 1814 by the [[Gloucester Old Bank]]]]\nThe British economy was disrupted by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and gold was hoarded. Among the measures taken to allow trade to continue was the issue of one-pound banknotes. The public came to like them as more convenient than the odd-value guinea. After the war, Parliament, by the [[Coinage Act 1816]], placed Britain officially on the [[gold standard]], with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=52\u201355}} Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.{{sfn|Seaby|pp=116\u2013117}} A committee of the [[Privy Council]] recommended gold coins of [[half sovereign|ten shillings]], twenty shillings, [[double sovereign|two pounds]] and [[Five pounds (British gold coin)|five pounds]] be issued, and this was accepted by [[George, Prince Regent]] on 3 August 1816.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=7}} The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}}\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:Sovereign George III 1817 641656.jpg|thumb|alt=A sovereign with a man's head on one side and a man fighting a dragon on the other|1817 sovereign of George III]]\n[[William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington|William Wellesley Pole]], elder brother of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], was appointed [[Master of the Mint]] (at that time a junior government position) in 1812, with a mandate to reform the Royal Mint. Pole had favoured retaining the guinea, due to the number extant and the amount of labour required to replace them with sovereigns.{{sfn|Clancy|p=55}} Formal instruction to the Mint came with an [[indenture]] dated February 1817, directing the Royal Mint to strike gold coins weighing 7.988 grams, that is to say, the new sovereign.{{efn|The indenture, dated 6 February 1817, directed that there be 934{{frac|1|2}} sovereigns struck from 20 [[troy pound]]s of standard gold.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Papers|volume=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw8TAAAAYAAJ|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|year=1866|p=27}}</ref>}}{{sfn|Clancy|p=56}}\n\nThe Italian sculptor [[Benedetto Pistrucci]] came to London early in 1816. His talent opened the doors of the capital's elite,{{sfn|ODNB}} among them [[Lavinia Spencer, Countess Spencer|Lady Spencer]], who showed Pistrucci a model in wax of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] by [[Nathaniel Marchant]] and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|her husband's]] regalia as a [[Knight of the Garter]]. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]].{{sfn|Marsh 1996|p=15}} The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in [[Leicester Square]], where he had stayed after coming to London.{{sfn|Farey September 2014|p=52}}\n\nIn 1816, Pole hired Pistrucci to create models for the new coinage.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=91}} After completing Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign would be [[Saint George]].{{sfn|Clancy|p=58}}{{sfn|Rodgers|pp=43\u201344}} He created a head, in [[jasper]], of King [[George III]], to be used as model for the sovereign and the smaller silver coins. He had prepared a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon for use on the [[crown (British coin)|crown]]; this was adapted for the sovereign. The Royal Mint's engravers were not able to successfully reproduce Pistrucci's imagery in steel, and the sculptor undertook the engraving of the dies himself.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=8}}\n\n=== Pistrucci's George and Dragon design ===\n[[File:Pistrucci sovereign sketch.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=The Saint George and Dragon design sketched on paper|Pistrucci's original sketch for the sovereign]]\nPistrucci's design for the reverse of the sovereign features Saint George on horseback. His left hand clutches the rein of the horse's bridle, and he does not wear armour, other than on his lower legs and feet, with his toes bare. Further protection is provided by the helmet, with, on early issues, a streamer or plume of hair floating behind. Also flowing behind the knight is his [[chlamys]], or cloak; it is fastened in front by a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]. George's right shoulder bears a [[baltens]] for suspending the [[gladius]], the sword that he grasps in his right hand.{{sfn|Allen|p=13}} He is otherwise naked{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=92}}\u2014the art critic [[John Ruskin]] later considered it odd that the saint should be unclothed going into such a violent encounter.{{sfn|Clancy|p=63}} The saint's horse appears to be half attacking, half shrinking from the dragon, which lies wounded by George's spear and in the throes of death.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=92}}\n\n[[File:Guinea Spade 692183.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A gold coin with a man's head on one side and a crowned heraldic shield on the other|The sovereign replaced the [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]].]]\nThe original 1817 design had the saintly knight still carrying part of the broken spear. This was changed to a sword when the [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] that originally surrounded the design was eliminated in 1821, and George is intended to have broken his spear earlier in the encounter with the dragon.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=10\u201316}} Also removed in 1821 was the plume of hair, or streamer, behind George's helmet; it was restored in 1887,{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=109}}\nmodified in 1893 and 1902,{{sfn|Allen|p=13}} and eliminated in 2009.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=101}}\n\nThe George and Dragon design is in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style. When Pistrucci created the coin, Neoclassicism was all the rage in London, and he may have been inspired by the [[Elgin Marbles]], which were exhibited from 1807, and which he probably saw soon after his arrival in London. Pistrucci's sovereign was unusual for a British coin of the 19th century in not having a heraldic design, but this was consistent with Pole's desire to make the sovereign look as different from the guinea as possible.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n== Circulation years (1817\u20131914) ==\n=== Early years (1817\u20131837) ===\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 24em | salign = right\n| quote =  Whereas We have thought fit to order that certain Pieces of Gold Money should be coined, which should be called \u201cSovereigns or Twenty Shilling Pieces,\u201d each of which should be of the Value of Twenty Shillings, and that each Piece should be of the Weight of Five Pennyweights Three Grains {{frac|2,740|10,000}} Troy Weight of Standard Gold&nbsp;...

Lack of demand meant that mintages dropped from 2,347,230 in 1818 to 3,574 the following year.{{sfn|Rodgers|p=44}} Another reasons why few sovereigns were struck in 1819 was in furtherance of a proposal, eventually rejected, by economist [[David Ricardo]] to eliminate gold as a coinage metal, though making it available on demand from the Bank of England. Once this plan was abandoned in 1820, the Bank encouraged the circulation of gold sovereigns, but acceptance among the British public was slow. As difficulties over the exchange of wartime banknotes were overcome, the sovereign became more popular, and with low-value banknotes becoming scarcer, in 1826 Parliament [[Country Bankers Act 1826|prohibited the issuance of notes]] with a value of less than five pounds in England and Wales.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=64\u201367}} \n\nThe early sovereigns were heavily exported; in 1819, [[Robert Peel]] estimated that of the some \u00a35,000,000 in gold struck in France since the previous year, three-quarters of the gold used had come from the new British coinage, melted down.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=64\u201367}} Many more sovereigns were exported to France in the 1820s as the metal alloyed with the gold contained silver, which could be profitably recovered, with the gold often returned to Britain and struck again into sovereigns. Beginning in 1829, the Mint was able to eliminate the silver, but the drain on sovereigns from before this continued.{{sfn|Craig|p=304}}\n\nGeorge III died in January 1820, succeeded by George, Prince Regent, as [[George IV]].  Mint officials decided to continue to use the late king's head on coinage for the remainder of the year.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=13}}\nFor King George IV's coinage, Pistrucci modified the George and Dragon reverse, eliminating the surrounding Garter ribbon and motto, with a reeded border substituted. Pistrucci also modified the figure of the saint, placing a sword in his hand in place of the broken lance seen previously, eliminating the streamer from his helmet, and refining the look of the cloak.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=98}}\n\nThe obverse design for George IV's sovereigns featured a \"Laureate head\" of George IV, based on the bust Pistrucci had prepared for the Coronation medal. The new version was authorised by an Order in Council of 5 May 1821. These were struck every year between 1821 and 1825, but the King was unhappy with the depiction of him and requested a new one be prepared, based on a more flattering bust by [[Francis Chantrey]]. Pistrucci refused to copy the work of another artist and was barred from further work on the coinage. Second Engraver (later Chief Engraver) [[William Wyon]] was assigned to translate Chantrey's bust into a coin design, and the new sovereign came into use during 1825. It did not bear the George and Dragon design, as the new Master of the Mint, [[Thomas Wallace, 1st Baron Wallace|Thomas Wallace]], disliked several of the current coinage designs, and had [[Jean Baptiste Merlen]] of the Royal Mint prepare new reverse designs.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=66\u201367}} The new reverse for the sovereign featured the Ensigns Armorial, or [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms of the United Kingdom]], crowned, with the lions of England seen in two of the quarters, balanced by that of Scotland and the harp of Ireland.

Two slightly different busts were used, with what is usually called the \"first bust\" used for most 1831 circulating pieces (the first year of production) and some from 1832, with the \"second bust\" used for the prototype [[pattern coins]] that year, as well as for [[proof coins]] of 1831, some from 1832 and taking over entirely by 1833. The reverse shows another depiction by Merlen of the Ensigns Armorial, with the date accompanied by the Latin word \"Anno\", or year. These were struck every year until the year of the King's death, 1837.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=21\u201327}}\n\n=== Victorian era ===\n\n[[File:Sovereign Victoria 1842 662015.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Gold coin with a woman's head on one side and a heraldic shield within a wreath on the other|1842 \"Shield reverse\" sovereign|261x261px]]\nThe accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837 ended the [[personal union]] between Britain and Hanover, as under the latter's [[Salic Law]], a woman could not take the Hanoverian throne. Thus, both sides of the sovereign had to be changed.{{sfn|Clancy|p=69}} Wyon designed his \"Young head\" portrait of the Queen, which he engraved, for the obverse, and Merlen engraved the reverse, depicting the royal arms inside a wreath, and likely played some part in designing it. The new coin was approved on 26 February 1838, and with the exception of 1840 and 1867, the \"shield back\" sovereign was struck at the Royal Mint in London every year from 1838 to 1874.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=27\u201338}} Sovereigns struck at London with the shield design between 1863 and 1874 bear small numbers under the shield, representing which [[coinage die]] was used. Records of why the numbers were used are not known to survive, with one widely printed theory that they were used to track die wear.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=31, 29}}\n\nBy 1850, some \u00a394 million in sovereigns and [[half sovereign]]s had been struck and  circulated widely, well beyond Britain's shores, a dispersion aided by the British government, who saw the sovereign's use as an auxiliary to their imperialist ambitions. Gold is a soft metal, and the hazards of circulation tended to make sovereigns lightweight over time. In 1838, when the legacy of [[James Smithson]] was converted into gold in preparation for transmission to the United States, American authorities requested recently-struck sovereigns, likely to maximise the quantity of gold when the sovereigns were melted after arrival in the United States. By the early 1840s, the Bank of England estimated that 20 per cent of the gold coins that came into its hands were lightweight. In part to boost the sovereign's reputation in trade, the Bank undertook a programme of recoinage, melting lightweight gold coins and using the gold for new, full-weight ones.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=70\u201371}} Between 1842 and 1845, the Bank withdrew and had recoined some \u00a314 million in lightweight gold, about one-third of the amount of that metal in circulation. This not only kept the sovereign to standard, it probably removed most of the remaining guineas still in commerce.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=484}} The unlucky holder of a lightweight gold coin could only turn it in as bullion, would lose at least a [[History of the British penny (1714\u20131901)|penny]] because of the lightness and often had to pay an equal amount to cover the Bank of England's costs.{{sfn|Craig|p=310}} There was also increased quality control within the Royal Mint; by 1866, every gold and silver coin was weighed individually.{{sfn|Craig|p=322}} The result of these efforts was that the sovereign became, in Sir [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]]'s later phrase, the \"chief coin of the world\".{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=511}}\n\nThe [[California Gold Rush]] and other discoveries of the 1840s and 1850s boosted the amount of available gold and also the number of sovereigns struck, with \u00a3150 million in sovereigns and half sovereigns coined between 1850 and 1875. The wear problem continued: it was estimated that on average, a sovereign became lightweight after fifteen years in circulation. The [[Coinage Act 1870]] tightened standards at the Royal Mint, requiring sovereigns to be individually tested at the annual [[Trial of the Pyx]] rather than in bulk.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}} These standards resulted in a high rejection rate for newly-coined sovereigns, though less than for the half sovereign, which sometimes exceeded 50 per cent.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|pp=520\u2013521}} When the Royal Mint was rebuilt in 1882, a deciding factor in the decision to shut down production for renovation rather than move to a new mint elsewhere was the Bank of England's report that there was an abnormally large stock of sovereigns and that no harm would result if they could not be coined at London for a year.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=525}} Advances in technology allowed sovereigns to be individually weighed by automated machines at the Bank of England by the 1890s and efforts to keep the coin at full weight were aided by an 1889 Act of Parliament which allowed redemption of lightweight gold coin at full face value, with the loss from wear to fall upon the government.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}} The Coinage Act 1889 also authorised the Bank of England to redeem worn gold coins from before Victoria's reign but on 22 November 1890, all gold coins from before her reign were called in by [[Royal Proclamation]] and demonetised effective 28 February 1891.{{sfn|Hayter|p=433}} Due to an ongoing programme to melt and recoin lightweight pieces, estimates of sovereigns in trade weighing less than the legal minimum had fallen to about 4 per cent by 1900.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Sovereign scale.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A handheld metal balance for weighing sovereigns and half sovereigns, along with several pieces that approximate the diameter or weight of those two coins|Sovereign counterfeit detector, with coin weights for the sovereign and half sovereign, and two replica coins the size of the sovereign and half sovereign.

[[Joseph Conrad]], in his novels set in Latin America, refers several times to ship captains keeping sovereigns as a ready store of value. Although many sovereigns were melted down for recoining on reaching a foreign land (as were those for the [[Smithsonian]]) it was regarded as a circulating coin in dozens of British colonies and even in nations such as Brazil and Portugal.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=73, 78\u201379, 85}}\n\nIn 1871, the Deputy Master of the Mint, Sir Charles Fremantle, restored the Pistrucci George and Dragon design to the sovereign, as part of a drive to beautify the coinage.{{sfn|Clancy|p=73}} The return of Saint George was approved by the Queen, and authorised by an Order in Council dated 14 January 1871.

The mints at Melbourne and Sydney were allowed to continue striking the shield design even though it had been abandoned at the London facility, and did so until 1887 due to local popularity.

[[Lord Randolph Churchill]] proposed relying less on gold coinage and moving to high-value silver coins, and the short-lived [[double florin]] or four-shilling piece is a legacy of his views. Churchill's successor, [[George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|George Goschen]], urged the issuance of banknotes to replace the gold coinage, and stated that he would prefer to have \u00a320 million in gold in the Bank of England than 30 million sovereigns in the hands of the public. Fears that widespread forgery of banknotes would shake confidence in the pound ended his proposal.{{sfn|Clancy|p=78}} \n\nIn March 1914, [[John Maynard Keynes]] noted that the large quantities of gold arriving from [[South Africa]] were making the sovereign even more important, \"The combination of the demand for sovereigns in India and Egypt with London's situation as the distributing centre of the South African gold is rapidly establishing the sovereign as the predominant gold coin of the world. Possibly it may be destined to hold in the future the same kind of international position as was held for several centuries, in the days of a silver standard, by the [[Spanish dollar|Mexican dollar]].\"{{sfn|Keynes|p=155}}\n\nAs Britain moved towards war in the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, many sought to convert Bank of England notes into gold, and the bank's reserves of that metal fell from \u00a327 million on 29 July to \u00a311 million on 1 August. Following the declaration of war against Germany on 4 August, the government circulated one-pound and ten-shilling banknotes in place of the sovereign and half sovereign.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=89\u201391}} Restrictions were placed on sending gold abroad, and the melting-down of coin made an offence.{{sfn|Josset|pp=143\u2013144}} Not all were enthusiastic about the change from gold to paper: J.J. Cullimore Allen, in his 1965 book on sovereigns, recalled meeting his first payroll after the change to banknotes, with the workers dubious about the banknotes and initially asking to be paid in gold. Allen converted five sovereigns from his own pocket into notes, and the workers made no further objection.{{sfn|Allen|p=7}}  Conversion into gold was not forbidden, but the Chancellor, [[David Lloyd George]], made it clear that such actions would be unpatriotic and would harm the war effort. Few insisted on payment in gold in the face of such appeals, and by mid-1915, the sovereign was rarely seen in London commerce. The coin was depicted on propaganda posters, which urged support for the war.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=89\u201391}}\n\nAlthough sovereigns continued to be struck at London until the end of 1917, they were mostly held as part of the nation's [[gold reserve]]s, or were paid out for war debts to the United States.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=77}} They were still used as currency in some foreign countries, especially in the Middle East.{{sfn|Josset|p=141}} Sovereigns continued to be struck at the Australian mints, where different economic circumstances prevailed. After the war, the sovereign did not return to commerce in Britain, with the pieces usually worth more as gold than as currency. In 1925, the Chancellor, [[Winston Churchill]], secured the passage of the [[Gold standard#Abandonment of the gold standard|Gold Standard Act 1925]], restoring Britain to that standard, but with gold to be kept in reserve rather than as a means of circulation. The effort failed\u2014Churchill regarded it as the worst mistake of his life\u2014-but some lightweight sovereigns were melted and restruck dated 1925, and were released only later.

The small strikings of 1925-dated sovereigns in the postwar period were not enough to meet the demand, which was met in part by counterfeiters in Europe and the Middle East, who often put full value of gold in the pieces. A counterfeiting prosecution was brought, to which the defence was made that the sovereign was no longer a current coin. The judge directed an acquittal although the sovereign remained legal tender under the Coinage Act 1870.{{sfn|Allen|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nSovereigns were struck in 1953, the Coronation year of [[Elizabeth II]], bearing the portrait of the Queen by [[Mary Gillick]], though the gold pieces were only placed in the major museums.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=95\u201397}} A 1953 sovereign sold at auction in 2014 for \u00a3384,000.{{sfn|Rodgers|p=47}}  In 1957, the Treasury decided to defend the status of the sovereign both by continuing prosecutions, and by issuing new pieces with the current date.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=95\u201397}} Elizabeth II sovereigns bearing Gillick's portrait were struck as bullion pieces between 1957 and 1959, and from 1962 to 1968.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=97}} The counterfeiting problem was minimised by the striking of about 45,000,000 sovereigns by 1968, and  efforts by Treasury solicitors which resulted in the sovereign's acceptance as legal tender by the highest courts of several European nations.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=598}} In 1966, the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] Government placed restrictions on the holding of gold coins to prevent hoarding against inflation, with collectors required to obtain a licence from the Bank of England.

Struck from 1817 until the present time, it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world; it is now a [[bullion coin]] and is sometimes mounted in [[jewellery]]. In most recent years, it has borne the design of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] on the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]]; the initials ({{small|B P}}) of the designer, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]], are visible to the right of the date.\n\nThe coin was named after the [[Sovereign (English coin)|English gold sovereign]], last minted about 1603, and originated as part of the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]]. Many in Parliament believed a one-pound coin should be issued rather than the 21-shilling (1.05 pounds) [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] struck until that time. The [[Master of the Mint]], [[William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington|William Wellesley Pole]], had Pistrucci design the new coin, and his depiction was also used for other gold coins. Originally, the coin was unpopular as the public preferred the convenience of banknotes, but paper currency of value \u00a31 was soon limited by law. With that competition gone, the sovereign not only became a popular circulating coin, but was used in international trade and in foreign lands, trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold.\n\nThe British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade, and the Royal Mint took steps to see that lightweight gold coins were withdrawn from circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India\u2014they have been struck again in India since 2013 (in addition to the production in Britain by the Royal Mint) for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.\n\nWith the start of the [[First World War]] in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Background and authorisation==\n[[File:Sovereign, Queen Mary, England, 1553 - Bode-Museum - DSC02751.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gold coin of medieval vintage showing a woman seated on a throne|[[Sovereign (English coin)|Sovereign]] of Queen Mary I, c. 1553]]\nThere had been an English coin known as the [[Sovereign (English coin)|sovereign]], first authorised by Henry VII in 1489. It had a diameter of {{convert|42|mm}}, and weighed {{convert|15.55|g}}, twice the weight of the existing gold coin, the [[spur ryal|ryal]]. The new coin was struck in response to a large influx of gold into Europe from West Africa in the 1480s, and Henry at first called it the double ryal, but soon changed the name to sovereign.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=61}} Too great in value to have any practical use in circulation, the original sovereign likely served as a presentation piece to be given to dignitaries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tudor sovereign|publisher=The Royal Mint Museum|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/coins/british-coinage/old-denominations/tudor-sovereign/index.html|accessdate=4 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe English sovereign, the country's first coin to be valued at one pound,{{sfn|Clancy|p=15}} was struck by the monarchs of the 16th century, the size and fineness often being altered. [[James I]], when he came to the English throne in 1603, issued a sovereign in the year of his accession,{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=3\u20134}} but the following year, soon after he proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, France{{efn|A historic claim only. See {{harvnb|Hubbard}}.}} and Ireland, he issued a proclamation for a new twenty-shilling piece. About ten per cent lighter than the final sovereigns, the new coin was called the [[unite (English coin)|unite]], symbolising that James had merged the Scottish and English crowns.{{sfn|Clancy|p=41}}\n\nIn the 1660s, following the [[Restoration of Charles II]] and the mechanisation of the [[Royal Mint]] that quickly followed, a new twenty-shilling gold coin was issued. It had no special name at first but the public soon nicknamed it the [[guinea (coin)|guinea]] and this became the accepted term.{{sfn|Clancy|p=45}} Coins were at the time valued by their precious metal content, and the price of gold relative to silver rose soon after the guinea's issuance. Thus, it came to trade at 21 [[shilling (English coin)|shillings]] or even sixpence more. Popular in commerce, the coin's value was set by the government at 21 shillings in silver in 1717, and was subject to revision downwards, though in practice this did not occur.{{sfn|Clancy|p=47}} The term sovereign, referring to a coin, fell from use\u2014it does not appear in [[Samuel Johnson's dictionary]], compiled in the 1750s.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}}\n\n[[File:\u00a31 Gloucester Old Bank note for Charles Evans & James Fell 1814.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Old piece of paper money with the inscription in script-appearing text|A \u00a31 note issued in 1814 by the [[Gloucester Old Bank]]]]\nThe British economy was disrupted by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and gold was hoarded. Among the measures taken to allow trade to continue was the issue of one-pound banknotes. The public came to like them as more convenient than the odd-value guinea. After the war, Parliament, by the [[Coinage Act 1816]], placed Britain officially on the gold standard, with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=52\u201355}} Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.{{sfn|Seaby|pp=116\u2013117}} A committee of the [[Privy Council]] recommended gold coins of [[half sovereign|ten shillings]], twenty shillings, [[double sovereign|two pounds]] and [[Five pounds (British gold coin)|five pounds]] be issued, and this was accepted by [[George, Prince Regent]] on 3 August 1816.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=7}} The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}}\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:Sovereign George III 1817 641656.jpg|thumb|alt=A sovereign with a man's head on one side and a man fighting a dragon on the other|1817 sovereign of George III]]\n[[William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington|William Wellesley Pole]], elder brother of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], was appointed [[Master of the Mint]] (at that time a junior government position) in 1812, with a mandate to reform the Royal Mint. Pole had favoured retaining the guinea, due to the number extant and the amount of labour required to replace them with sovereigns.{{sfn|Clancy|p=55}} Formal instruction to the Mint came with an [[indenture]] dated February 1817, directing the Royal Mint to strike gold coins weighing 7.988 grams, that is to say, the new sovereign.{{efn|The indenture, dated 6 February 1817, directed that there be 934{{frac|1|2}} sovereigns struck from 20 [[troy pound]]s of standard gold.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Papers|volume=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw8TAAAAYAAJ|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|year=1866|p=27}}</ref>}}{{sfn|Clancy|p=56}}\n\nThe Italian sculptor [[Benedetto Pistrucci]] came to London early in 1816. His talent opened the doors of the capital's elite,{{sfn|ODNB}} among them [[Lavinia Spencer, Countess Spencer|Lady Spencer]], who showed Pistrucci a model in wax of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] by [[Nathaniel Marchant]] and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|her husband's]] regalia as a [[Knight of the Garter]]. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]].{{sfn|Marsh 1996|p=15}} The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in [[Leicester Square]], where he had stayed after coming to London.{{sfn|Farey September 2014|p=52}}\n\nIn 1816, Pole hired Pistrucci to create models for the new coinage.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=91}} After completing Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign would be [[Saint George]].{{sfn|Clancy|p=58}}{{sfn|Rodgers|pp=43\u201344}} He created a head, in [[jasper]], of King [[George III]], to be used as model for the sovereign and the smaller silver coins. He had prepared a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon for use on the [[crown (British coin)|crown]]; this was adapted for the sovereign. The Royal Mint's engravers were not able to successfully reproduce Pistrucci's imagery in steel, and the sculptor undertook the engraving of the dies himself.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=8}}\n\n=== Pistrucci's George and Dragon design ===\n[[File:Pistrucci sovereign sketch.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=The Saint George and Dragon design sketched on paper|Pistrucci's original sketch for the sovereign]]\nPistrucci's design for the reverse of the sovereign features Saint George on horseback. His left hand clutches the rein of the horse's bridle, and he does not wear armour, other than on his lower legs and feet, with his toes bare. Further protection is provided by the helmet, with, on early issues, a streamer or plume of hair floating behind. Also flowing behind the knight is his [[chlamys]], or cloak; it is fastened in front by a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]. George's right shoulder bears a [[baltens]] for suspending the [[gladius]], the sword that he grasps in his right hand.{{sfn|Allen|p=13}} He is otherwise naked{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=92}}\u2014the art critic [[John Ruskin]] later considered it odd that the saint should be unclothed going into such a violent encounter.{{sfn|Clancy|p=63}} The saint's horse appears to be half attacking, half shrinking from the dragon, which lies wounded by George's spear and in the throes of death.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=92}}\n\n[[File:Guinea Spade 692183.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A gold coin with a man's head on one side and a crowned heraldic shield on the other|The sovereign replaced the [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]].]]\nThe original 1817 design had the saintly knight still carrying part of the broken spear. This was changed to a sword when the [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] that originally surrounded the design was eliminated in 1821, and George is intended to have broken his spear earlier in the encounter with the dragon.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=10\u201316}} Also removed in 1821 was the plume of hair, or streamer, behind George's helmet; it was restored in 1887,{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=109}}\nmodified in 1893 and 1902,{{sfn|Allen|p=13}} and eliminated in 2009.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=101}}\n\nThe George and Dragon design is in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style. When Pistrucci created the coin, Neoclassicism was all the rage in London, and he may have been inspired by the [[Elgin Marbles]], which were exhibited from 1807, and which he probably saw soon after his arrival in London. Pistrucci's sovereign was unusual for a British coin of the 19th century in not having a heraldic design, but this was consistent with Pole's desire to make the sovereign look as different from the guinea as possible.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n== Circulation years (1817\u20131914) ==\n=== Early years (1817\u20131837) ===\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 24em | salign = right\n| quote =  Whereas We have thought fit to order that certain Pieces of Gold Money should be coined, which should be called \u201cSovereigns or Twenty Shilling Pieces,\u201d each of which should be of the Value of Twenty Shillings, and that each Piece should be of the Weight of Five Pennyweights Three Grains {{frac|2,740|10,000}} Troy Weight of Standard Gold&nbsp;...

Lack of demand meant that mintages dropped from 2,347,230 in 1818 to 3,574 the following year.{{sfn|Rodgers|p=44}} Another reasons why few sovereigns were struck in 1819 was in furtherance of a proposal, eventually rejected, by economist [[David Ricardo]] to eliminate gold as a coinage metal, though making it available on demand from the Bank of England. Once this plan was abandoned in 1820, the Bank encouraged the circulation of gold sovereigns, but acceptance among the British public was slow. As difficulties over the exchange of wartime banknotes were overcome, the sovereign became more popular, and with low-value banknotes becoming scarcer, in 1826 Parliament [[Country Bankers Act 1826|prohibited the issuance of notes]] with a value of less than five pounds in England and Wales.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=64\u201367}} \n\nThe early sovereigns were heavily exported; in 1819, [[Robert Peel]] estimated that of the some \u00a35,000,000 in gold struck in France since the previous year, three-quarters of the gold used had come from the new British coinage, melted down.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=64\u201367}} Many more sovereigns were exported to France in the 1820s as the metal alloyed with the gold contained silver, which could be profitably recovered, with the gold often returned to Britain and struck again into sovereigns. Beginning in 1829, the Mint was able to eliminate the silver, but the drain on sovereigns from before this continued.{{sfn|Craig|p=304}}\n\nGeorge III died in January 1820, succeeded by George, Prince Regent, as [[George IV]].  Mint officials decided to continue to use the late king's head on coinage for the remainder of the year.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=13}}\nFor King George IV's coinage, Pistrucci modified the George and Dragon reverse, eliminating the surrounding Garter ribbon and motto, with a reeded border substituted. Pistrucci also modified the figure of the saint, placing a sword in his hand in place of the broken lance seen previously, eliminating the streamer from his helmet, and refining the look of the cloak.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=98}}\n\nThe obverse design for George IV's sovereigns featured a \"Laureate head\" of George IV, based on the bust Pistrucci had prepared for the Coronation medal. The new version was authorised by an Order in Council of 5 May 1821. These were struck every year between 1821 and 1825, but the King was unhappy with the depiction of him and requested a new one be prepared, based on a more flattering bust by [[Francis Chantrey]]. Pistrucci refused to copy the work of another artist and was barred from further work on the coinage. Second Engraver (later Chief Engraver) [[William Wyon]] was assigned to translate Chantrey's bust into a coin design, and the new sovereign came into use during 1825. It did not bear the George and Dragon design, as the new Master of the Mint, [[Thomas Wallace, 1st Baron Wallace|Thomas Wallace]], disliked several of the current coinage designs, and had [[Jean Baptiste Merlen]] of the Royal Mint prepare new reverse designs.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=66\u201367}} The new reverse for the sovereign featured the Ensigns Armorial, or [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms of the United Kingdom]], crowned, with the lions of England seen in two of the quarters, balanced by that of Scotland and the harp of Ireland. Set on the shield are the arms of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]],{{efn|The British monarch also ruled Hanover between 1714 and 1837. See {{harvnb|Seaby|pp=134, 153}}.}} again crowned, depicting the armorial bearings of [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]], [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Celle]]. The George and Dragon design would not again appear on the sovereign until 1871.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|p=99}}\n\n[[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'s accession in 1830 upon the death of his brother George led to new designs for the sovereign, with the new King's depiction engraved by William Wyon based on a bust by Chantrey. Two slightly different busts were used, with what is usually called the \"first bust\" used for most 1831 circulating pieces (the first year of production) and some from 1832, with the \"second bust\" used for the prototype [[pattern coins]] that year, as well as for [[proof coins]] of 1831, some from 1832 and taking over entirely by 1833. The reverse shows another depiction by Merlen of the Ensigns Armorial, with the date accompanied by the Latin word \"Anno\", or year.

Thus, both sides of the sovereign had to be changed.{{sfn|Clancy|p=69}} Wyon designed his \"Young head\" portrait of the Queen, which he engraved, for the obverse, and Merlen engraved the reverse, depicting the royal arms inside a wreath, and likely played some part in designing it. The new coin was approved on 26 February 1838, and with the exception of 1840 and 1867, the \"shield back\" sovereign was struck at the Royal Mint in London every year from 1838 to 1874.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=27\u201338}} Sovereigns struck at London with the shield design between 1863 and 1874 bear small numbers under the shield, representing which [[coinage die]] was used. Records of why the numbers were used are not known to survive, with one widely printed theory that they were used to track die wear.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=31, 29}}\n\nBy 1850, some \u00a394 million in sovereigns and [[half sovereign]]s had been struck and  circulated widely, well beyond Britain's shores, a dispersion aided by the British government, who saw the sovereign's use as an auxiliary to their imperialist ambitions. Gold is a soft metal, and the hazards of circulation tended to make sovereigns lightweight over time. In 1838, when the legacy of [[James Smithson]] was converted into gold in preparation for transmission to the United States, American authorities requested recently-struck sovereigns, likely to maximise the quantity of gold when the sovereigns were melted after arrival in the United States. By the early 1840s, the Bank of England estimated that 20 per cent of the gold coins that came into its hands were lightweight. In part to boost the sovereign's reputation in trade, the Bank undertook a programme of recoinage, melting lightweight gold coins and using the gold for new, full-weight ones.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=70\u201371}} Between 1842 and 1845, the Bank withdrew and had recoined some \u00a314 million in lightweight gold, about one-third of the amount of that metal in circulation. This not only kept the sovereign to standard, it probably removed most of the remaining guineas still in commerce.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=484}} The unlucky holder of a lightweight gold coin could only turn it in as bullion, would lose at least a [[History of the British penny (1714\u20131901)|penny]] because of the lightness and often had to pay an equal amount to cover the Bank of England's costs.{{sfn|Craig|p=310}} There was also increased quality control within the Royal Mint; by 1866, every gold and silver coin was weighed individually.{{sfn|Craig|p=322}} The result of these efforts was that the sovereign became, in Sir [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]]'s later phrase, the \"chief coin of the world\".{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=511}}\n\nThe [[California Gold Rush]] and other discoveries of the 1840s and 1850s boosted the amount of available gold and also the number of sovereigns struck, with \u00a3150 million in sovereigns and half sovereigns coined between 1850 and 1875. The wear problem continued: it was estimated that on average, a sovereign became lightweight after fifteen years in circulation. The [[Coinage Act 1870]] tightened standards at the Royal Mint, requiring sovereigns to be individually tested at the annual [[Trial of the Pyx]] rather than in bulk.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}} These standards resulted in a high rejection rate for newly-coined sovereigns, though less than for the half sovereign, which sometimes exceeded 50 per cent.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|pp=520\u2013521}} When the Royal Mint was rebuilt in 1882, a deciding factor in the decision to shut down production for renovation rather than move to a new mint elsewhere was the Bank of England's report that there was an abnormally large stock of sovereigns and that no harm would result if they could not be coined at London for a year.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=525}} Advances in technology allowed sovereigns to be individually weighed by automated machines at the Bank of England by the 1890s and efforts to keep the coin at full weight were aided by an 1889 Act of Parliament which allowed redemption of lightweight gold coin at full face value, with the loss from wear to fall upon the government.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}} The Coinage Act 1889 also authorised the Bank of England to redeem worn gold coins from before Victoria's reign but on 22 November 1890, all gold coins from before her reign were called in by [[Royal Proclamation]] and demonetised effective 28 February 1891.{{sfn|Hayter|p=433}} Due to an ongoing programme to melt and recoin lightweight pieces, estimates of sovereigns in trade weighing less than the legal minimum had fallen to about 4 per cent by 1900.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Sovereign scale.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A handheld metal balance for weighing sovereigns and half sovereigns, along with several pieces that approximate the diameter or weight of those two coins|Sovereign counterfeit detector, with coin weights for the sovereign and half sovereign, and two replica coins the size of the sovereign and half sovereign.

[[Joseph Conrad]], in his novels set in Latin America, refers several times to ship captains keeping sovereigns as a ready store of value. Although many sovereigns were melted down for recoining on reaching a foreign land (as were those for the [[Smithsonian]]) it was regarded as a circulating coin in dozens of British colonies and even in nations such as Brazil and Portugal.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=73, 78\u201379, 85}}\n\nIn 1871, the Deputy Master of the Mint, Sir Charles Fremantle, restored the Pistrucci George and Dragon design to the sovereign, as part of a drive to beautify the coinage.{{sfn|Clancy|p=73}} The return of Saint George was approved by the Queen, and authorised by an Order in Council dated 14 January 1871. The two designs were struck side by side in London from 1871 to 1874, and at the Australian branch mints until 1887, after which the Pistrucci design alone was used.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=47}} The saint returned to the rarely-struck two- and five-pound pieces in 1887, and was placed on the half-sovereign in 1893.{{sfn|Clancy|p=65}} Wyon's \"Young head\" of Queen Victoria for the sovereign's obverse was struck from 1838 until 1887, when it was replaced by the \"Jubilee head\" by Sir [[Joseph Boehm]].{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=47, 57}} That obverse was criticised and was replaced in 1893 by the \"Old head\" by Sir [[Thomas Brock]].{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=64}} Victoria's death in 1901 led to a new obverse for her son and successor, [[Edward VII]] by [[George William de Saulles]], which began production in 1902; Edward's death in 1910 necessitated a new obverse for his son, [[George V]] by [[Bertram Mackennal]].

The mints at Melbourne and Sydney were allowed to continue striking the shield design even though it had been abandoned at the London facility, and did so until 1887 due to local popularity. The large issues of the colonial mints meant that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns circulating in Britain were from Australia.{{sfn|Celtel & Gullbekk|pp=131\u2013132}}{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=28\u201329, 64}} Dies for the Australian coinage were made at London.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|pp=530\u2013531}}\n\n[[File:2017I sovereign.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gold coin in a red card|2017-I sovereign in card of issue]]\nFollowing the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the Canadian Government asked for the establishment of a Royal Mint branch in Canada.

[[Lord Randolph Churchill]] proposed relying less on gold coinage and moving to high-value silver coins, and the short-lived [[double florin]] or four-shilling piece is a legacy of his views. Churchill's successor, [[George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|George Goschen]], urged the issuance of banknotes to replace the gold coinage, and stated that he would prefer to have \u00a320 million in gold in the Bank of England than 30 million sovereigns in the hands of the public. Fears that widespread forgery of banknotes would shake confidence in the pound ended his proposal.{{sfn|Clancy|p=78}} \n\nIn March 1914, [[John Maynard Keynes]] noted that the large quantities of gold arriving from [[South Africa]] were making the sovereign even more important, \"The combination of the demand for sovereigns in India and Egypt with London's situation as the distributing centre of the South African gold is rapidly establishing the sovereign as the predominant gold coin of the world. Possibly it may be destined to hold in the future the same kind of international position as was held for several centuries, in the days of a silver standard, by the [[Spanish dollar|Mexican dollar]].\"{{sfn|Keynes|p=155}}\n\nAs Britain moved towards war in the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, many sought to convert Bank of England notes into gold, and the bank's reserves of that metal fell from \u00a327 million on 29 July to \u00a311 million on 1 August. Following the declaration of war against Germany on 4 August, the government circulated one-pound and ten-shilling banknotes in place of the sovereign and half sovereign.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=89\u201391}} Restrictions were placed on sending gold abroad, and the melting-down of coin made an offence.{{sfn|Josset|pp=143\u2013144}} Not all were enthusiastic about the change from gold to paper: J.J. Cullimore Allen, in his 1965 book on sovereigns, recalled meeting his first payroll after the change to banknotes, with the workers dubious about the banknotes and initially asking to be paid in gold. Allen converted five sovereigns from his own pocket into notes, and the workers made no further objection.{{sfn|Allen|p=7}}  Conversion into gold was not forbidden, but the Chancellor, [[David Lloyd George]], made it clear that such actions would be unpatriotic and would harm the war effort. Few insisted on payment in gold in the face of such appeals, and by mid-1915, the sovereign was rarely seen in London commerce. The coin was depicted on propaganda posters, which urged support for the war.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=89\u201391}}\n\nAlthough sovereigns continued to be struck at London until the end of 1917, they were mostly held as part of the nation's [[gold reserve]]s, or were paid out for war debts to the United States.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=77}} They were still used as currency in some foreign countries, especially in the Middle East.{{sfn|Josset|p=141}} Sovereigns continued to be struck at the Australian mints, where different economic circumstances prevailed. After the war, the sovereign did not return to commerce in Britain, with the pieces usually worth more as gold than as currency. In 1925, the Chancellor, [[Winston Churchill]], secured the passage of the [[Gold standard#Abandonment of the gold standard|Gold Standard Act 1925]], restoring Britain to that standard, but with gold to be kept in reserve rather than as a means of circulation. The effort failed\u2014Churchill regarded it as the worst mistake of his life\u2014-but some lightweight sovereigns were melted and restruck dated 1925, and were released only later. Many of the Australian pieces struck in the postwar period were to back currency, while the South African sovereigns were mostly for export and to pay workers at the gold mines.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=92\u201393}}{{sfn|Allen|p=10}}\n\nBy the time [[Edward VIII]] came to the throne in 1936, there was no question of issuing sovereigns for circulation, but pieces were prepared as part of the traditional [[proof set]] of coins issued in the Coronation year. With a bust of King Edward by [[Humphrey Paget]] and the date 1937, these sovereigns were not authorised by Royal Proclamation prior to [[Abdication of Edward VIII|the King's abdication]] in December 1936, and are considered pattern coins.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|pp=88\u201389}} Extremely rare, one sold in 2020 for \u00a31,000,000, setting a record for a British coin.<ref>{{cite news|title='Never meant to exist': Edward VIII coin bought for record \u00a31m|date=17 January 2020|accessdate=17 January 2020|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/17/never-meant-to-exist-edward-viii-coin-bought-for-record-1m|agency=PA Media|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Sovereigns in proof condition dated 1937 were struck for Edward's brother and successor, [[George VI]], also designed by Paget, the only sovereigns to bear George's effigy.

The small strikings of 1925-dated sovereigns in the postwar period were not enough to meet the demand, which was met in part by counterfeiters in Europe and the Middle East, who often put full value of gold in the pieces. A counterfeiting prosecution was brought, to which the defence was made that the sovereign was no longer a current coin. The judge directed an acquittal although the sovereign remained legal tender under the Coinage Act 1870.{{sfn|Allen|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nSovereigns were struck in 1953, the Coronation year of [[Elizabeth II]], bearing the portrait of the Queen by [[Mary Gillick]], though the gold pieces were only placed in the major museums.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=95\u201397}} A 1953 sovereign sold at auction in 2014 for \u00a3384,000.{{sfn|Rodgers|p=47}}  In 1957, the Treasury decided to defend the status of the sovereign both by continuing prosecutions, and by issuing new pieces with the current date.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=95\u201397}} Elizabeth II sovereigns bearing Gillick's portrait were struck as bullion pieces between 1957 and 1959, and from 1962 to 1968.{{sfn|Marsh 2017|p=97}} The counterfeiting problem was minimised by the striking of about 45,000,000 sovereigns by 1968, and  efforts by Treasury solicitors which resulted in the sovereign's acceptance as legal tender by the highest courts of several European nations.{{sfn|Dyer & Gaspar|p=598}} In 1966, the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] Government placed restrictions on the holding of gold coins to prevent hoarding against inflation, with collectors required to obtain a licence from the Bank of England.

Called \"Sweden's darkest pop export\" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> she is known for her raw, [[grunge music|grunge]]-influenced take on [[pop music]]. Her honest, complex and [[autobiography|autobiographical]] lyrical content has led to her being dubbed \"the saddest girl in Sweden\".<ref name=\"Out\" />\n\nRaised in the [[Djursholm]] district of [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], Lo is an alumna of the music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet. She formed the rock band Tremblebee in 2006. After it disbanded, Lo pursued a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] in 2011. Working with producers [[Alexander Kronlund]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Xenomania]], she became a successful songwriter, while also recording and releasing her own compositions independently.\n\nIn 2013, Lo was signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The following year, Lo rose to prominence with her debut album, ''[[Queen of the Clouds]]'', which opened at number 14 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in October 2014. It spawned the [[sleeper hit]] single \"[[Habits (Stay High)]]\", which peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as \"[[Talking Body]]\". Her second album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released in October 2016 and debuted at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single, \"[[Cool Girl]]\", became an international hit. Her follow-up records, ''[[Blue Lips]]'' (2017) and ''[[Sunshine Kitty]]'' (2019), also performed well, the latter spawning the song \"[[Glad He's Gone]], which was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Music Video.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Lo has co-written songs for other artists, including: [[Lorde]]'s \"[[Homemade Dynamite (Lorde song)|Homemade Dynamite]]\" (2017) and [[Ellie Goulding]]'s \"[[Love Me like You Do]]\" (2015), a song that garnered her [[Grammy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations.

1987), known professionally as '''Tove Lo''' ({{IPA-sv|\u02c8t\u00fb\u02d0v\u025b \u02c8lu\u02d0}}), is a Swedish singer and songwriter. Called \"Sweden's darkest pop export\" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> she is known for her raw, [[grunge music|grunge]]-influenced take on [[pop music]]. Her honest, complex and [[autobiography|autobiographical]] lyrical content has led to her being dubbed \"the saddest girl in Sweden\".<ref name=\"Out\" />\n\nRaised in the [[Djursholm]] district of [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], Lo is an alumna of the music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet. She formed the rock band Tremblebee in 2006. After it disbanded, Lo pursued a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] in 2011. Working with producers [[Alexander Kronlund]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Xenomania]], she became a successful songwriter, while also recording and releasing her own compositions independently.\n\nIn 2013, Lo was signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The following year, Lo rose to prominence with her debut album, ''[[Queen of the Clouds]]'', which opened at number 14 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in October 2014. It spawned the [[sleeper hit]] single \"[[Habits (Stay High)]]\", which peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as \"[[Talking Body]]\". Her second album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released in October 2016 and debuted at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single, \"[[Cool Girl]]\", became an international hit. Her follow-up records, ''[[Blue Lips]]'' (2017) and ''[[Sunshine Kitty]]'' (2019), also performed well, the latter spawning the song \"[[Glad He's Gone]], which was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Music Video.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Lo has co-written songs for other artists, including: [[Lorde]]'s \"[[Homemade Dynamite (Lorde song)|Homemade Dynamite]]\" (2017) and [[Ellie Goulding]]'s \"[[Love Me like You Do]]\" (2015), a song that garnered her [[Grammy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations. She has collaborated with many artists, including [[Alesso]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Seven Lions]], [[Broods]], [[Urban Cone]] and [[Coldplay]].\n\n==Early life==\nEbba Tove Elsa Nilsson was born on 29 October 1987 in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|author=Savage, Mark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26954021|title=Tove Lo: A Swedish pop star in waiting|work=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, John D.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tove-lo-mn0003035440/biography|title=Tove Lo Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> She has one older brother and is the daughter of [[iZettle]] [[co-founder]] Magnus Nilsson and psychologist Gunilla Nilsson Edholm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/916940?programid=2071|title= Tove \"Tove Lo\" Nilsson|date=15 July 2017|access-date=5 January 2019|language=sv}}</ref><ref name=\"Popjustice\">{{cite web|author=Robinson, Peter|url=http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/an-interview-with-tove-lo/124165/|title=An interview with Tove Lo|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> Her lifelong nickname and adopted stage name, Tove Lo, was given to her at age three by her godmother because of her love for [[lynx]]es (singular: \"lo\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> She explained; \"There was this lynx at a zoo that was called Tove, and that I totally fell in love with.

He had to resign from WFUN after drawing ire from the FCC for announcing a competing disc jockey's home phone number on the air and insulting his wife.  Like his father, Downey pursued a career in music, recording in both [[pop music|pop]] and [[country music|country]] styles. He sang on a few [[gramophone record|records]] and then began to write songs, several of which were popular in the 1950s and 1960s. He joined [[ASCAP]] as a result. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1958, he recorded \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Al Dubin song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/x5556 |title=Proud Profession/Boulevard of Broken Dreams |website=45cat.com |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref> which he sang on national television on a set that resembled a dark street with one street light.

At that time, he was also running for President of the United States, as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

The program featured screaming matches among Downey, his guests, and audience members.

He went on to work as a [[disc jockey]], sometimes using the moniker \"Doc\" Downey, in various markets around the U.S., including [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] (KRIZ), [[Miami]] ([[WAXY (AM)|WFUN]]), [[Kansas City]] (KUDL), [[San Diego]] ([[KECR|KDEO]]) and [[Seattle]] ([[KJR (AM)|KJR]]). He had to resign from WFUN after drawing ire from the FCC for announcing a competing disc jockey's home phone number on the air and insulting his wife.  Like his father, Downey pursued a career in music, recording in both [[pop music|pop]] and [[country music|country]] styles. He sang on a few [[gramophone record|records]] and then began to write songs, several of which were popular in the 1950s and 1960s. He joined [[ASCAP]] as a result. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1958, he recorded \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Al Dubin song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/x5556 |title=Proud Profession/Boulevard of Broken Dreams |website=45cat.com |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref> which he sang on national television on a set that resembled a dark street with one street light. In 1981, \"[[Green Eyed Girl]]\" charted on the ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' country chart, peaking at #95.\n\nIn the 1980s, Downey was a [[Talk radio|talk show]] host at [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]]-[[AM radio|AM]] in [[Sacramento, California]], where he employed his abrasive style.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.440.com/namesd2.html#_ddowne Downey's entry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428122657/http://www.440.com/namesd2.html#_ddowne |date=2012-04-28 }} at 440 International</ref> He was fired in 1984, and was subsequently replaced by [[Rush Limbaugh]].

At that time, he was also running for President of the United States, as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. The United Students for Life, at [[California State University, Sacramento]] helped organize his California presidential rallies.

Starting as a local program on [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[New Jersey]] [[superstation]] [[WWOR-TV]] in October 1987, it expanded into national [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in early 1988. The program featured screaming matches among Downey, his guests, and audience members. Using a large silver bowl for an [[ashtray]], he would [[chainsmoke]] during the show and blow smoke in his guests' faces. Downey's fans became known as \"Loudmouths,\" patterned after the studio [[lectern]]s decorated with gaping cartoon mouths, from which Downey's guests would go head-to-head against each other on their respective issues.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-12-19/features/8802260373_1_morton-downey-jr-public-housing-issue-cards|title=Morton Downey Jr. Is In Game Form|author= Rick Kogan|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date = December 19, 1988}}</ref>\n\nDowney's signature phrases \"[[pablum]] puking [[Liberalism|liberal]]\" (in reference to left-liberals) and \"zip it!\" briefly enjoyed some popularity in the contemporary vernacular.

Over the course of the 1988\u201389 television season, his TV show suffered a decline in viewership, resulting from many markets downgrading its time slot; even flagship station WWOR moved Downey's program from its original 9:00 PM slot to 11:30 PM in the fall of 1988. Beginning in January 1989, the time slot immediately following Downey's program was given to the then-new ''[[Arsenio Hall Show]]''. Following Hall's strong early ratings, however, the two series swapped time slots several weeks later, thus relegating Downey to 12:30 AM in the number-one [[television market]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn late April 1989, he was involved in an incident in a [[San Francisco International Airport]] restroom in which he claimed to have been attacked by [[neo-Nazi]]s who painted a [[swastika]] on his face and attempted to shave his head.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Host Takes a Beating|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/43987/TV-HOST-TAKES-A-BEATING.html|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=26 April 1989}}</ref> Some inconsistencies in Downey's account (e.g., the swastika was painted in reverse, suggesting that Downey had drawn it himself in a [[mirror]]), and the failure of the [[police]] to find supportive evidence,<ref>{{cite news|title=Attacked or Not?|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/45045/ATTACKED-OR-NOT.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Deseret news|date=May 3, 1989}}</ref> led many to suspect the incident was a [[hoax]] and a ploy for attention.<ref name=\"washpost\">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-412459.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026094823/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-412459.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 26, 2012|title='Mort the Mouth' Downey Jr. Dies; 'Trash TV' Talk-Show Host's Draw Was Shocking, Mocking|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 14, 2001|accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref><ref name=\"CBSDeath\"/> In July 1989, his show was canceled, with the owners of the show announcing that the last episode had been taped on June 30, and that no new shows would air after September 15, 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=Morton Downey Jr. Show is History|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/56373/MORTON-DOWNEY-JR-SHOW-IS-HISTORY.html|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=August 23, 2011|date=July 23, 1989}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of its cancellation, the show was airing on a total of 70 stations across the country, and its advertisers had been reduced primarily to \"direct-response\" ads (such as 900 chat line and [[phone sex]] numbers).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/20/arts/downey-show-canceled.html|work=The New York Times|first=Jeremy|last=Gerard|title=Downey Show Canceled|date=July 20, 1989}}</ref> In February 1990, Downey filed for [[bankruptcy]] in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|title=Downey Wants Protection from Creditors|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/88157/DOWNEY-WANTS-PROTECTION-FROM-CREDITORS.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=February 22, 1989}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1990, Downey resurfaced on [[CNBC]] with an interview program called ''Showdown'', which was followed by three attempted talk radio comebacks: first in 1992 on [[Washington, D.C.]] radio station [[WTEM|WWRC]]; then in 1993 on [[Dallas]] radio station [[KFXR (AM)|KGBS]], where he would scream insults at his callers.<ref name=\"trashtalk\">{{cite web|work=Report|publisher=Ellen Hume|url=http://www.ellenhume.com/articles/talkshow3.htm|title=Talk Show Culture|accessdate=2007-06-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701043528/http://www.ellenhume.com/articles/talkshow3.htm|archivedate=2007-07-01}}</ref> He was also hired as the station's VP of Operations.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The following year, he returned to CNBC with a short-lived television show, ''Downey''; in one episode, Downey claimed to have had a [[psychic]] communication with [[O.
