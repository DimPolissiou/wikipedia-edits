the cause was domestic religious conflict.<ref name=guardian-europe-the-struggle-for-supremacy-review/> Evans also cites counterexamples to Simms' assertion that conflict and foreign policy drove democratisation and the development of civil liberties: the [[Reign of Terror]], the crushing of civil liberties in Britain during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the rise of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]].<ref name=guardian-europe-the-struggle-for-supremacy-review/>\n\nHe also points out that Simms rarely mentions economic factors, saying that when he does \"it is often breathtakingly wrong-headed\", citing Simms blame of the [[Great Depression|great depression]] in Germany on the French government rather than blind adherence to the [[Gold standard]]| and the withdrawal of American loans after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]].<ref name=guardian-europe-the-struggle-for-supremacy-review/>\n\nEvans criticises Simms for obsessing with Germany as the driving force in European history, pointing out that Simms ignores periods when French expansionism was the motor for war.<ref name=guardian-europe-the-struggle-for-supremacy-review/>\n===Hitler:Only the World Was Enough===\nEvans was also critical of ''Hitler:Only the World Was Enough'', pointing out that Simms' claim that Hitler was a socialist did not stand up to examination.<ref name=guardian-hitler-by-brendan-simms-and-hitler-by-peter-longerich-problematic-portraits>{{Cite news|title=Hitler by Brendan Simms and Hitler by Peter Longerich review \u2013 problematic portraits|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/27/hitler-only-the-world-was-enough-and-hitler-a-life-review|last=Evans|first=Richard|date=27 September 2019|access-date=23 April 2020|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Simms cited violence of Nazi stormtroopers against conservatives, but Evans pointed out that socialists and communists made up the overwhelming majorith of those 200000 thrown into concentration camps in Hitlers' first year in power.<ref name=guardian-hitler-by-brendan-simms-and-hitler-by-peter-longerich-problematic-portraits/> Simms claimed that Hitler's rhetoric was more anti-capitalist than anti-communist, but Evans points out that the anti-communist rhetoric dominated the political portion of [[Mein Kampf]].<ref name=guardian-hitler-by-brendan-simms-and-hitler-by-peter-longerich-problematic-portraits/> Simms claims that Hitler had managed \"to nationalise German industrialists by making them instruments of his political will\" which Evans disputes -

Claudio Caniggia\"/>\n\nAt the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Caniggia scored two key goals to help Argentina reach the final. In the opening game of the tournament against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], he was fouled three times in a single dribble, the last taking him out and earning [[Benjamin Massing]] a red card. In the second round match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], a pass by [[Diego Maradona]] put him through against goalkeeper [[Claudio Taffarel|Taffarel]], with Caniggia [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] past him and slotting the ball into the net to give Argentina victory. In the semi-final against Italy, he headed past goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]], the first goal Italy conceded in the tournament, sending the match into extra time as Argentina won on penalties. Having been booked against Italy, his second in the tournament, Caniggia was suspended for the final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\nCaniggia scored two goals in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], both of them in the first round match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], the first from a [[Gabriel Batistuta]] free kick rebound and second one from a free kick by Maradona, which Caniggia finished by putting the ball in top right hand corner.\n\nAs well as appearing for River Plate and Boca Juniors, his other clubs include [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\n==Club career==\nAt club level, Caniggia played for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] (1985\u201388), [[Hellas Verona]] (1988\u201389), [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] (1989\u201392 and 1999\u20132000), [[A.S.

He has become a club legend and [[cult following|cult-hero]] at many of the clubs he has played at. Especially when scoring against Dunfermline in 2003 to help Rangers win the title \n\nCaniggia got a 13-month ban for taking cocaine in 1993 and has a history of enjoying the high life. After his ban expired he joined Benfica on a year-long loan financed by the [[Parmalat]] dairy company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Darkness descends on the Stadium of Light|publisher=The Scotsman|date=22 June 1997}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = \n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width = 500\n|header = \n|image1 = Caniggia river.jpg \n|image2 = Caniggia verona.jpg\n|image3 = Caniggia atalanta.jpg\n|footer = Three moments in the club career of Caniggia: with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] (1987), [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] (1988) and [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] (1999)\n}}\nArgentine media mogul [[Eduardo Eurnekian]] then acquired the rights to Caniggia from Roma and [[Diego Maradona]] from [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]], loaning them to Boca Juniors in exchange for matches played on his television stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maradona prepares for grand return|publisher=The Times|author=Rob Hughes|date=29 August 1995}}</ref> At the completion of his one-year contract, Caniggia's outspoken wife refused to return to [[Argentina]] and he was heavily linked with clubs in England.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOCCER: ARGENTINA'S CANIGGIA FREE FOR THE TAKING|publisher=The Guardian|author=Martin Thorpe|date=21 September 1996}}</ref> In September 1996 his mother committed suicide by jumping from the fifth floor of her building<ref>{{cite news|title=Ends in tears|publisher=The Times|author=Martin Thorpe|date=28 September 1996}}</ref> and Caniggia did not play in the [[1996\u201397 in Argentine football|1996\u201397]] season. He returned to play for Boca in [[1997\u201398 in Argentine football|1997\u201398]] but his appearances were sporadic as he missed out on the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad. After another season of inactivity he re-joined Atalanta in [[Serie B]], but left after one season following a dispute with coach [[Giovanni Vavassori]]. He then signed for Scottish club Dundee, managed by Ivano Bonnetti whom he knew well from their time together in Italy. Quickly becoming Dundee's star player, he was then transferred to Rangers, becoming a fans favourite at Ibrox, after scoring against arch rivals Celtic in a cup final.\n\nIn June 2012, he was one of several former professional footballers who agreed to join [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] to play in their FA Cup campaign for the new season. Caniggia and fellow former-internationals [[Ray Parlour]], [[Martin Keown]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]], [[Danny Dichio]] and [[Brian McBride]], plus [[David Seaman]] (goalkeeping coach) and former England manager [[Terry Venables]] (technical advisor), came out of retirement to play for Wembley who were featured in a television documentary as they endeavoured to help the club play at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry Venables' Wembley FC recruit former stars for FA Cup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18534739|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=21 June 2012}}</ref> On 12 August 2012, he appeared in a preliminary round of the [[FA Cup]].

He played at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, scoring 4 goals in 8 matches. Contrary to popular belief and largely due to loose interpretation, Caniggia was not a pure striker, but rather a [[playmaker]] or [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|creative forward]].\n\nCaniggia is great friends with Argentine legend and former international teammate Diego Maradona; the duo once celebrated a goal with a kiss on the lips. Claudio's wife at that time, model Mariana Nannis, said: \"At times I believe Diego is in love with my husband. It must be the long hair and big muscles.\"\n\n===1990 World Cup===\n[[File:Caniggia brasil 1990.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Caniggia scored a key goal v [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nAt the 1990 World Cup, Caniggia scored two key goals to help Argentina reach the final. He came off the bench in the inaugural match against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in Milan, memorably being fouled three times in a single dribble as he carried the ball forward, the last, by [[Benjamin Massing]] earning the Cameroonian a straight red card (Massing kicked Caniggia so hard his own shoe came off). In the subsequent matches, Caniggia was in the starting lineup. In the second round, Argentina faced [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in Turin, and with the score 0\u20130 after 80 minutes, a pass by Diego Maradona left Caniggia one on one against Brazilian goalkeeper [[Claudio Taffarel|Taffarel]]; Caniggia dribbled past him and scored on the empty goal, giving Argentina the victory and eliminating Brazil from the tournament in what was seen as a huge upset. The goal gave him legendary status among the Argentine fans for knocking out their chief rivals.\n\nArgentina then beat [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in Florence on [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], advancing to semifinals, where they played against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Naples. The Italians had not conceded any goals in five matches, and were up 1\u20130 at halftime. In the second half, Caniggia headed a cross into the net of goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]], ending his record streak at 517 minutes without conceding a goal, and sending the match into extra time. After no change in the score, penalty kicks were taken, and Argentina won again through this method, advancing to the final. Caniggia had been cautioned in the team's second first round match against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]], and then received another yellow card against Italy for deliberately handling the ball, which earned him a suspension. He had to watch the final between his team and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] from the stands in Rome, which Argentina lost 0\u20131.\n\n===1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica, 1992 Confederations Cup and 1993 Artemio Franchi cup===\n[[File:Caniggia define vs paraguay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Caniggia with Argentina scoring against Paraguay at the [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]]]\nThroughout the [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], Caniggia asserted his dominance and was arguably the most dynamic player; he scored 2 goals and made 4 assists in the tournament as Argentina won the title. He also helped Argentina win the [[1992 FIFA Confederations Cup|1992 Confederations Cup]], in which he scored a goal in the [[1992 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|final]] itself. In February 1993, he scored the goal of the 1-1 tie between Argentina and Denmark in the [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]], held in Mar del Plata. Argentina finally won by penalties and was declared intercontinental champion.\n\n===1994 World Cup===\nCaniggia scored two goals in the 1994 World Cup, both of them in the first round match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], the first from a [[Gabriel Batistuta]] free kick rebound and second one from a free kick by Diego Maradona, which he finished, putting the ball in top right hand corner. He was taken out of Argentina's third game against Bulgaria 26 minutes into the match in the boiling heat of Dallas, an Argentine team who were also without Maradona. He was left out of the Argentine squad for the team's Round of 16 match against Romania in Los Angeles; Argentina lost 3\u20132 and were out of the tournament.\n\n===2002 World Cup===\nAfter refusing to cut his long hair despite the rules of national coach Daniel Passarella, he was frozen out of the national team for a number of years. He made a brief comeback to the [[Marcelo Bielsa]]-coached squad for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but did not play. He received a [[Misconduct (football)|red card]] for cursing at the referee from the bench in Argentina's last match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], becoming the first player to be sent off from the bench in a World Cup.\n\n==Personal life==\nCaniggia was married to Mariana Nannis (57 years old). They had three children: son Kevin Axel, son Alexander Dimitri, and daughter [[Charlotte Chantal Caniggia|Charlotte Chantal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leggo.it/GOSSIP/NEWS/isola_dei_famosi_charlotte_caniggia/notizie/1119908.shtml |title=Isola, Charlotte Caniggia: \"Ho rifatto naso seno e labbra.

Claudio Caniggia\"/>\n\nAt the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Caniggia scored two key goals to help Argentina reach the final. In the opening game of the tournament against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], he was fouled three times in a single dribble, the last taking him out and earning [[Benjamin Massing]] a red card. In the second round match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], a pass by [[Diego Maradona]] put him through against goalkeeper [[Claudio Taffarel|Taffarel]], with Caniggia [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] past him and slotting the ball into the net to give Argentina victory. In the semi-final against Italy, he headed past goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]], the first goal Italy conceded in the tournament, sending the match into extra time as Argentina won on penalties. Having been booked against Italy, his second in the tournament, Caniggia was suspended for the final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\nCaniggia scored two goals in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], both of them in the first round match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], the first from a [[Gabriel Batistuta]] free kick rebound and second one from a free kick by Maradona, which Caniggia finished by putting the ball in top right hand corner.\n\nAs well as appearing for River Plate and Boca Juniors, his other clubs include [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\n==Club career==\nAt club level, Caniggia played for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] (1985\u201388), [[Hellas Verona]] (1988\u201389), [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] (1989\u201392 and 1999\u20132000), [[A.S.

He has become a club legend and [[cult following|cult-hero]] at many of the clubs he has played at. Especially when scoring against Dunfermline in 2003 to help Rangers win the title \n\nCaniggia got a 13-month ban for taking cocaine in 1993 and has a history of enjoying the high life. After his ban expired he joined Benfica on a year-long loan financed by the [[Parmalat]] dairy company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Darkness descends on the Stadium of Light|publisher=The Scotsman|date=22 June 1997}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = \n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width = 500\n|header = \n|image1 = Caniggia river.jpg \n|image2 = Caniggia verona.jpg\n|image3 = Caniggia atalanta.jpg\n|footer = Three moments in the club career of Caniggia: with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] (1987), [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] (1988) and [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] (1999)\n}}\nArgentine media mogul [[Eduardo Eurnekian]] then acquired the rights to Caniggia from Roma and [[Diego Maradona]] from [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]], loaning them to Boca Juniors in exchange for matches played on his television stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maradona prepares for grand return|publisher=The Times|author=Rob Hughes|date=29 August 1995}}</ref> At the completion of his one-year contract, Caniggia's outspoken wife refused to return to [[Argentina]] and he was heavily linked with clubs in England.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOCCER: ARGENTINA'S CANIGGIA FREE FOR THE TAKING|publisher=The Guardian|author=Martin Thorpe|date=21 September 1996}}</ref> In September 1996 his mother committed suicide by jumping from the fifth floor of her building<ref>{{cite news|title=Ends in tears|publisher=The Times|author=Martin Thorpe|date=28 September 1996}}</ref> and Caniggia did not play in the [[1996\u201397 in Argentine football|1996\u201397]] season. He returned to play for Boca in [[1997\u201398 in Argentine football|1997\u201398]] but his appearances were sporadic as he missed out on the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad. After another season of inactivity he re-joined Atalanta in [[Serie B]], but left after one season following a dispute with coach [[Giovanni Vavassori]]. He then signed for Scottish club Dundee, managed by Ivano Bonnetti whom he knew well from their time together in Italy. Quickly becoming Dundee's star player, he was then transferred to Rangers, becoming a fans favourite at Ibrox, after scoring against arch rivals Celtic in a cup final.\n\nIn June 2012, he was one of several former professional footballers who agreed to join [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] to play in their FA Cup campaign for the new season. Caniggia and fellow former-internationals [[Ray Parlour]], [[Martin Keown]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]], [[Danny Dichio]] and [[Brian McBride]], plus [[David Seaman]] (goalkeeping coach) and former England manager [[Terry Venables]] (technical advisor), came out of retirement to play for Wembley who were featured in a television documentary as they endeavoured to help the club play at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry Venables' Wembley FC recruit former stars for FA Cup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18534739|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=21 June 2012}}</ref> On 12 August 2012, he appeared in a preliminary round of the [[FA Cup]].

He played at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, scoring 4 goals in 8 matches. Contrary to popular belief and largely due to loose interpretation, Caniggia was not a pure striker, but rather a [[playmaker]] or [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|creative forward]].\n\nCaniggia is great friends with Argentine legend and former international teammate Diego Maradona; the duo once celebrated a goal with a kiss on the lips. Claudio's wife at that time, model Mariana Nannis, said: \"At times I believe Diego is in love with my husband. It must be the long hair and big muscles.\"\n\n===1990 World Cup===\n[[File:Caniggia brasil 1990.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Caniggia scored a key goal v [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nAt the 1990 World Cup, Caniggia scored two key goals to help Argentina reach the final. He came off the bench in the inaugural match against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in Milan, memorably being fouled three times in a single dribble as he carried the ball forward, the last, by [[Benjamin Massing]] earning the Cameroonian a straight red card (Massing kicked Caniggia so hard his own shoe came off). In the subsequent matches, Caniggia was in the starting lineup. In the second round, Argentina faced [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in Turin, and with the score 0\u20130 after 80 minutes, a pass by Diego Maradona left Caniggia one on one against Brazilian goalkeeper [[Claudio Taffarel|Taffarel]]; Caniggia dribbled past him and scored on the empty goal, giving Argentina the victory and eliminating Brazil from the tournament in what was seen as a huge upset. The goal gave him legendary status among the Argentine fans for knocking out their chief rivals.\n\nArgentina then beat [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in Florence on [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], advancing to semifinals, where they played against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Naples. The Italians had not conceded any goals in five matches, and were up 1\u20130 at halftime. In the second half, Caniggia headed a cross into the net of goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]], ending his record streak at 517 minutes without conceding a goal, and sending the match into extra time. After no change in the score, penalty kicks were taken, and Argentina won again through this method, advancing to the final. Caniggia had been cautioned in the team's second first round match against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]], and then received another yellow card against Italy for deliberately handling the ball, which earned him a suspension. He had to watch the final between his team and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] from the stands in Rome, which Argentina lost 0\u20131.\n\n===1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica, 1992 Confederations Cup and 1993 Artemio Franchi cup===\n[[File:Caniggia define vs paraguay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Caniggia with Argentina scoring against Paraguay at the [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]]]\nThroughout the [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], Caniggia asserted his dominance and was arguably the most dynamic player; he scored 2 goals and made 4 assists in the tournament as Argentina won the title. He also helped Argentina win the [[1992 FIFA Confederations Cup|1992 Confederations Cup]], in which he scored a goal in the [[1992 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|final]] itself. In February 1993, he scored the goal of the 1-1 tie between Argentina and Denmark in the [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]], held in Mar del Plata. Argentina finally won by penalties and was declared intercontinental champion.\n\n===1994 World Cup===\nCaniggia scored two goals in the 1994 World Cup, both of them in the first round match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], the first from a [[Gabriel Batistuta]] free kick rebound and second one from a free kick by Diego Maradona, which he finished, putting the ball in top right hand corner. He was taken out of Argentina's third game against Bulgaria 26 minutes into the match in the boiling heat of Dallas, an Argentine team who were also without Maradona. He was left out of the Argentine squad for the team's Round of 16 match against Romania in Los Angeles; Argentina lost 3\u20132 and were out of the tournament.\n\n===2002 World Cup===\nAfter refusing to cut his long hair despite the rules of national coach Daniel Passarella, he was frozen out of the national team for a number of years. He made a brief comeback to the [[Marcelo Bielsa]]-coached squad for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but did not play. He received a [[Misconduct (football)|red card]] for cursing at the referee from the bench in Argentina's last match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], becoming the first player to be sent off from the bench in a World Cup.\n\n==Personal life==\nCaniggia was married to Mariana Nannis (57 years old). They had three children: son Kevin Axel, son Alexander Dimitri, and daughter [[Charlotte Chantal Caniggia|Charlotte Chantal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leggo.it/GOSSIP/NEWS/isola_dei_famosi_charlotte_caniggia/notizie/1119908.shtml |title=Isola, Charlotte Caniggia: \"Ho rifatto naso seno e labbra.

By origin, it was the forest of Madhupur under the rule of [[Bhawal Estate]]. It is located in [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]], [[Dhaka Division]] of [[Bangladesh]], approximately  40&nbsp;km north of [[Dhaka]] city, only 20&nbsp;km drive from [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]] and 20&nbsp;km from [[Kapasia]].  The core area of the park covers 940 hectares but extends to 5,022 ha of surrounding forest. Its purpose is to protect important habitats as well as to provide opportunities for recreation. It has been kept under [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN Management Category V]], as a protected landscape. The most common flora  is the unique coppice sal forest. The area was noted for peacocks, tiger, leopard, black panther, elephant, clouded leopard and sambar deer. However much of the wildlife had disappeared and only a few species remain. Also, most of the forest has been denuded and is now occupied by forestry companies or displaced people.<ref>{{cite web\n|year= 2005\n|month=\n|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/nepal/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/340/332\n|title=Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park: Management Techniques and Drawbacks of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation\n|publisher=bangladesh.com\n|accessdate=2011-09-30 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|year=\n|month=\n|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/nepal/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/340/332\n|title=Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park\n|publisher=School of Environmental Science and Management, Independent School, Bangladesh\n|accessdate=2007-08-18 \n}}</ref>\n\nMost of this area was covered by forests fifty years ago and the dominant species was Sal (''[[Shorea robusta]]'').

By origin, it was the forest of Madhupur under the rule of [[Bhawal Estate]]. It is located in [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]], [[Dhaka Division]] of [[Bangladesh]], approximately  40&nbsp;km north of [[Dhaka]] city, only 20&nbsp;km drive from [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]] and 20&nbsp;km from [[Kapasia]].  The core area of the park covers 940 hectares but extends to 5,022 ha of surrounding forest. Its purpose is to protect important habitats as well as to provide opportunities for recreation. It has been kept under [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN Management Category V]], as a protected landscape. The most common flora  is the unique coppice sal forest. The area was noted for peacocks, tiger, leopard, black panther, elephant, clouded leopard and sambar deer. However much of the wildlife had disappeared and only a few species remain. Also, most of the forest has been denuded and is now occupied by forestry companies or displaced people.<ref>{{cite web\n|year= 2005\n|month=\n|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/nepal/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/340/332\n|title=Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park: Management Techniques and Drawbacks of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation\n|publisher=bangladesh.com\n|accessdate=2011-09-30 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|year=\n|month=\n|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/nepal/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/340/332\n|title=Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park\n|publisher=School of Environmental Science and Management, Independent School, Bangladesh\n|accessdate=2007-08-18 \n}}</ref>\n\nMost of this area was covered by forests fifty years ago and the dominant species was Sal (''[[Shorea robusta]]'').
