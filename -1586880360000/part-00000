{"title_page": "List of Deadliest Catch episodes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Deadliest Catch'' episodes}}\n''[[Deadliest Catch]]'' is a [[documentary]] [[television series]] produced by [[Original Productions]] for the [[Discovery Channel]]. It portrays the [[real life]] events aboard [[fishing vessel]]s in the [[Bering Sea]] during the [[Alaskan king crab]], [[Chionoecetes|queen crab]], [[Chionoecetes opilio|and snow crab]] fishing seasons. The [[Aleutian Islands]] port of [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]], is the base of operations for the [[fishing fleet]]. The show's title derives from the inherent high risk of injury or death associated with the work.\n\n''Deadliest Catch'' premiered on the Discovery Channel on April 12, 2005, and the show currently airs worldwide. The first season consisted of ten episodes, with the finale airing on June 14, 2005. Subsequent seasons have aired on the same April to June or July schedule every year since the original 2005 season. Currently, 15 seasons of ''Deadliest Catch'' has aired in addition to 13 specials.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\"|Originally aired\n|-\n!First aired\n!Last aired\n|-\n|style=\"background: #5EC5C4;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 1 (2005)|1]]\n|10\n|{{Start date|2005|4|12}}\n|{{End date|2005|6|14}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #EDCC26\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 2 (2006)|2]]\n|12\n|{{Start date|2006|3|28}}\n|{{End date|2006|6|13}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ACF16C\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 3 (2007)|3]]\n|12\n|{{Start date|2007|4|3}}\n|{{End date|2007|6|19}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #CC6CFF\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 4 (2008)|4]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2008|4|15}}\n|{{End date|2008|7|22}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #FF5F5F\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 5 (2009)|5]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2009|4|14}}\n|{{End date|2009|7|28}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #FFFF00\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 6 (2010)|6]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2010|4|13}}\n|{{End date|2010|7|27}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #05615E;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 7 (2011)|7]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2011|4|12}}\n|{{End date|2011|7|26}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #F0E68C;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 8 (2012)|8]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2012|4|10}}\n|{{End date|2012|7|24}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #80C1E0;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 9 (2013)|9]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2013|4|16}}\n|{{End date|2013|7|30}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #665638;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 10 (2014)|10]]\n|16\n|{{Start date|2014|4|22}}\n|{{End date|2014|8|5}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #A4273E;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 11 (2015)|11]]\n|18\n|{{Start date|2015|4|14}}\n|{{End date|2015|8|18}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #005B9C;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 12 (2016)|12]]\n|18\n|{{Start date|2016|3|29}}\n|{{End date|2016|8|2}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #8D338A;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 13 (2017)|13]]\n|19\n|{{Start date|2017|4|11}}\n|{{End date|2017|8|29}}\n|-\n|style=\"background: #FF5F6C;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 14 (2018)|14]]\n|19\n|{{Start date|2018|4|10}}\n|August 28, 2018\n|-\n|style=\"background: #55FFFF;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 15 (2019)|15]]\n|21\n|April 9, 2019\n|September 10, 2019\n|-\n|style=\"background: #00CC22;\"|\n|[[List of Deadliest Catch episodes#Season 16 (2020)|16]]\n|TBA\n|April 14, 2020\n|2020\n|-\n|}\n\n== Episodes ==\n=== Season 1 (2005) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#5EC5C4 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=30 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Greenhorns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary    = Introductions to the crews of the ships and the backgrounds for the greenhorns who would be working for the first time on some of the ships, as well as some boats' traditions for dealing with greenhorns\u2014Sig Hansen, captain of the ''Northwestern'', refuses to greet or acknowledge greenhorn Bradford Davis until after he sees how he will work out on board.

After a very successful offload at the ''Northwestern'' traditional offload port, [[Akutan, Alaska|Akutan]], Bradford, the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn, is awarded 10% of a deckhand's share for his hard work and good attitude\u2014about $1600\u2014and finally gets a greeting and handshake from Captain Sig Hansen.\n |LineColor      = 5EC5C4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Dead of Winter\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|10}}\n |ShortSummary    = The ships left Dutch Harbor for the deadlier [[chionoecetes|opilio crab]] season, the last one to be held under the derby-style rules. The weather was treacherous, with heavy gale warnings and high seas predicted. The ''Lady Alaska'' had to return to port due to electrical problems, costing them a day of the already short season. The ''Northwestern'' headed out to the far northern Opilio fishing grounds, near the Russian border. As the rest of the boats neared the fishing grounds, a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] alert was issued to the fleet: An [[EPIRB]], belonging to the F/V ''Big Valley'', had been activated, and no one on the ''Big Valley'' was answering radio hails or satellite phone calls. Three fishing vessels, including ''Maverick'' and the ''Cornelia Marie'', started the search, joined just before dawn by a Coast Guard helicopter, but found nothing at the position indicated by the EPIRB. As dawn broke, debris from the ''Big Valley'' was all that could be seen, making it clear that the boat sunk. A single life raft from the ''Big Valley'' was found with one survivor, deck boss Cache Seel, in it. Seel, who had managed to get into his survival suit before getting tossed into the sea, confirmed that the ''Big Valley'' capsized and went down quickly; three men died shortly after falling into the sea with no survival suits on. The Coast Guard found another man wearing a survival suit and pulled him from the water, but declared him dead shortly thereafter.\n |LineColor       = 5EC5C4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Man Overboard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|5|17}}\n |ShortSummary    = The last man was found from the ''Big Valley'' disaster, raising the death toll to five, with Cache Seel as the only survivor. The boats of the fleet were finally able to begin casting pots after a day of delays. However, shortly after getting started, a man fell overboard on the ''Sultan''. The ship was unable to rescue him, bringing the death toll to six before the first 24 hours had passed. Captain Jeff Weeks of the Billikin realizes that the dead crewman from the ''Sultan'' is a friend of one of his own crewmen, who earlier expressed hope that his friend was not the one who died.

This rumor pushed the crews harder, so boats were wondering where to put the extra crab. Other boats were just now hitting the sweet spot, and trying to make up for lost time. As the announcement of the end of the season arrives, giving boats just 36 more hours to work the fishing grounds, fatigued crews are pushed to work as hard as they can in the remaining time. Alaska crab fishing is normally done in a derby-style competition, where crews catch as much crab as they can during the season; the 2005 Opilio season would be the last year fishing like this, and the resulting IFQ (Individual Fishing Quota) system will put many smaller boats (like the ''Lady Alaska'') out of business. All the captains express a great desire to make this last run the best; the ''Maverick'' hustles to fill their tanks a second time in the short season.\n |LineColor       = 5EC5C4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = The Final Run\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|14}}\n |ShortSummary    = This opilio season had been a deadly one, with the deaths of the ''Big Valley'' crew and a crewman from the ''Sultan'' who fell overboard just hours later. Boats were reaching their holding tank capacities and crews were reaching their mental and physical limits, but the fleet kept going in an effort to catch the year's wages in the remaining 24 hours. The ''Northwestern'' builds a \"deck load\", a holding pen to store the crab from their last pots on deck with water passing over them in hopes that they will survive long enough to reach the processors. As the last few hours ticked down, the second leg of the race began, the race to the processing plants. Off-loading is done on a first-come, first-served basis, making decisions of when to return to port critical to the success of a season. Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'', knowing his deck load will not last long in the weather, gathers the last of his pots and sets course for the processors. Though the trip to the processor should be the safest part of the trip, Hansen relates the story of the ''St. Patrick'', whose crew abandoned ship in December 1981 just a few miles from the Kodiak as their boat took on water; only two crew members survived, a loss made even more tragic by the knowledge that the ''St. Patrick'' had managed to right itself after the crew abandoned ship and did not sink until several days after it had been successfully towed into port. As luck would have it, the ''Northwestern'' becomes one of the first boats to arrive at the processors, and their deck load weathered the journey well; however, the crew takes great pleasure in riding a fellow crewman's poor observation skills when his tally of the crab poundage fails to match up with the official total by over 20,000 pounds. Since crab will not last forever on a boat's hold, a crab boat's place in line to get to the processor is crucial; access to the processor is limited, and the wait could be hours or even days. Days would cost thousands in dead crab; when crab die in a boat's hold, their deceased bodies release poisons into the hold that affect all the crab, often resulting in a chain reaction of deaths creating massive amounts of \"deadloss\", or dead crabs that cannot be processed. The ''Maverick'' lost a portion of their load to deadloss when their wait in line for the processor turned into an extra week at sea, but the rest of their load held up well and the boat turned a nice profit, becoming one of the few vessels to have filled their holding tanks twice within the short Opilio season. The ''Northwestern'' won the 2005 Derby with the highest overall catch total in both halves of the Alaskan crab season (King and Opilio). Captains who would not return for the new IFQ-style fishing bid their crews goodbye as they return to port; other captains who would be going on under [[Individual fishing quota|IFQ]] acknowledged that crab fishing, as they knew it, will change forever with the end of the Derby era.\n |LineColor        = 5EC5C4\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 2 (2006) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#EDCC26 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=30 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Heading Out to Sea\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|28}}\n |ShortSummary    = The crew returned to their boats in October 2005 for the start of the first King Crab season run under Individual Fishing Quota (\"IFQ\") rules. The fleet had been cut by over half due to new regulations and quotas; however, the season had also been lengthened to three weeks in an effort to make crab fishing safer by not forcing boats to fish during a small window of time that might be compromised by poor conditions on the Bering Sea. The returning captains toasted each other in the traditional pre-season dinner at the UniSea bar, with Phil Harris, captain of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and 20+ year rival of the Hansens on the Bering Sea, noting that he missed \"being able to beat (''Northwestern'' Captain Sig Hansen's) ass\" under the new IFQ system, to which Sig Hansen responded that he glad he was \"the ass to beat.\" The 2005 King Crab season was due to start on October 14, 2005; however, many boats decided not to leave port due to two reasons: Predicted severe weather over the fishing grounds, and superstition for \"Unlucky Friday\". The ''Time Bandit'' defied the superstition and left anyway, but its first few pots were nearly empty. The fishing picked up for the ''Time Bandit'' eventually. The ''Cornelia Marie'' had just started setting their pots when their main engine blew a head gasket. Mindful of the bad weather to come, Captain Phil Harris ordered his crew to offload the pots as fast as possible so that they could return to Dutch Harbor with an empty deck. Stuck at Dutch Harbor was the ''Maverick'', which had failed its Coast Guard safety inspection; because the sinking of the ''Big Valley'' in January 2005 had been attributed at least in part to carrying a pot load 30% over its declared pot weight, all the boats got extra scrutiny about their pot loads, and the ''Maverick'' was carrying 30 more pots than was considered safe under the USCG rules. ''Maverick'' deck boss Blake Painter had been promised a promotion to Captain at the mid-point of the king crab season; getting the boat cleared by the Coast Guard was the first test current Captain Rick Quashnick gave to Blake to measure his readiness to take command. The new IFQ system gave each boat a quota of crabs to catch (often larger than the boats' previous take due to the decimation of the fleet) and a longer time window to catch them; thus, out at sea, as the weather worsened with warnings of severe storms approaching, captains had to make decisions about whether to continue fishing through the storm (as would be the case under the derby system) or find a safe port until the weather clears. \n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title=Batten Down the Hatches\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|4}}\n |ShortSummary    = As a pair of storm systems began converging on the fishing grounds, several boats faced major mechanical issues made even more dangerous by the bad weather. The ''Rollo'' had a number of problems common to older fishing boats: Leaking hydraulic lines on the crane; broken hoses on the coiling block; two old ropes giving way on two separate pots, causing both the loss of the pots and the crabs therein; and a broken steering computer. The ''Cornelia Marie'' limped back to Dutch Harbor with a blown head gasket that turned out to be worse than expected; parts had to be ordered from the Alaskan mainland, costing the crew time and money. The ''Maverick'' finally passed its Coast Guard inspection but stayed at Dutch Harbor due to weather conditions. Crew members on the ''Maverick'' voiced their discontent with Blake's verbal excitement about taking on the job of Captain at mid-season, and even Captain Rick Quashnick appeared skeptical. As the weather changed, the ''Maverick'' finally left Dutch Harbor to join the rest of the fleet, while the ''Northwestern'', after heavy discussions between the Hansen brothers, decided to seek refuge from the converging storms behind [[Amak Island]].\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = On the Crab\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|11}}\n |ShortSummary    = The crews made headway in bringing crab on-board and fought even more rough weather. The ''Maverick'' dealt with two crew issues: Blake's continued trumpeting his coming rise to the captain's chair that had been verbally promised to him by Captain Quashnick during the offseason; and angry veteran crewmember Hiram, who was frustrated that the ''Maverick'' was employing a greenhorn (who was excited about seeing full pots coming aboard) while many of his own friends, crab veterans with far more experience, had been put out of work by the IFQ system. Boat Mother Donna Quashnick counseled the ''Maverick'' crew to give Hiram time to vent, and the next morning the squabble seemed forgotten as the crew returned to work. The ''Cornelia Marie'', fresh off extensive engine repairs at Dutch Harbor, had just reached the fishing grounds and begun retrieving their pots that had been left soaking for days when the same engine threw a piston, creating even more destructive engine damage and forcing Captain Harris to take the boat back to Dutch Harbor again. The ''Northwestern'' continued their annual tradition of finding superb fishing grounds away from other boats, pulling in pots with nearly 70 crabs each on average, but when another severe storm approached the fleet, the Hansens weighed the odds of their nearly full tanks surviving the battering of an Arctic squall without serious deadloss and decided to head for the processors and cash out their load before the bad weather hit. The ''Rollo'' continued to have serious equipment issues, losing their GPS indicator in the middle of the night during a blizzard.\n |LineColor=EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Finish Line\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|18}}\n |ShortSummary    = Many of the crews, including the ''Northwestern'' and ''Maverick'', headed to St. Paul Island to offload their northern IFQ share catches. The ''Northwestern'' catch was smaller than expected, putting Sig Hansen significantly behind on making his overall quota; however, none of the ''Northwestern'' crew voiced anything but praise for their captain's fishing instincts. Edgar Hansen, ''Northwestern'' Deck Boss and Sig's younger brother, notes that \"That man has made me more money than I could wish for, and he's kept us safe while doing it\u2014no fatalities, no major injuries, knock on wood.\" As the ''Maverick'' headed for the processors at St. Paul, deck boss Blake Painter hung up his deck oilskins for what he hoped would be the last time, anticipating taking over as Captain of the ''Maverick'' once the ''Maverick'' reached St. Paul Island. However, Captain Rick Quashnick began having second thoughts about leaving his ship to a new captain in the middle of a crab season, especially since the crewmember who would be interim deck boss with Blake's promotion vowed to quit rather than work for Blake. Quashnick made the difficult choice to forgo his retirement at least until the end of this King Crab season, angering Blake, who had been chasing a dream \"ever since I was four years old...all I wanted to be was the captain of a red crab boat.\" Seeing Blake's passion for the job of captain and not merely a passion for the extra money such a job would bring impresses Hiram, who finally turns from Blake's harshest critic to one of his strongest defenders; \"He'll make his mark on fishing, no doubt about it. To be so young and so mature at the same time...he'll make a fine captain.\" The ''Rollo'' finally catches a break in both the weather and the crab catching and started to make headway on their catching their own IFQ shares for the season when a [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] cruiser hailed the captain and announced they will be boarding for a surprise mid-season inspection. Both captain and crew on the ''Rollo'' were very nervous, especially since the 9-man inspection team essentially took over the boat for the next three hours, but finally the USCG pronounced them \"in full compliance\" and departed. The ''Northwestern'' returned to where they had left pots soaking before their side trip to the processors and found all the pots full; however, their joy was cut short when one of the hydraulic arms on the launcher snapped a connector pin, rendering it useless. Sig's repair\u2014essentially using a sledgehammer to drive in a new pin into the pneumatic cylinder\u2014lasted all of 10 seconds; when Edgar tried to close the launcher, the connector and pin shot out of the launcher like a harpoon. The Hansens decided to risk running the launcher on one hydraulic lift and returned to pulling pots. Aboard the ''Aleutian Ballad'', a greenhorn became so distraught by the extreme conditions of the Bering Sea that he threatened to jump off the boat right then and there and kill himself, forcing Captain Corky Tilley to return to Dutch Harbor with the young man on the edge of a nervous breakdown the entire way. An [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] Police Officer escorted the greenhorn personally from the dock to the airport to ensure his departure from Dutch Harbor without further incident. By the time the ''Aleutian Ballad'' returned to sea, the storm surge was more brutal than ever, and a [[rogue wave]] hit the ''Aleutian Ballad'', knocking it nearly 90 degrees over and trashing the wheelhouse.\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Friends and Rivals\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = The ''Aleutian Ballad'', knocked over by a rogue wave, managed to right itself, but with several crew members injured\u2014including Captain Tilley's own daughter, Nicole\u2014as well as its computer not coming back on line and the wheelhouse and deck damaged, Captain Tilley decided to return to port for repairs rather than risk more damage in the storms. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' discussed a change in duty with his ship's greenhorn\u2014Harris' youngest son, Jacob\u2014and declared that Jake may finally be ready to take shifts inside the wheelhouse so that the captain can get some rest, which had been a goal of Jake's all season long. As the fishing continued at full speed aboard the ''Northwestern'', Edgar Hansen decides to celebrate the launch of the last pot string of the season with a traditional Norwegian meal of boiled [[salt cod]], Captain Sig's favorite dish. The ''Rollo'' dealt with a coffee crisis\u2014down to less than half a can of grounds left, they still had a long string of pots to pull in before the end of the season, so the remaining coffee was rationed until the final pot was pulled; the crew celebrated the end of their season with the last pot of coffee left. Blake Painter, still upset about being passed over for the captain's job on the ''Maverick'', expressed his hope that he will still get to pilot the ''Maverick'' soon, perhaps as early as the upcoming Opilio season. The ''Cornelia Marie'', still needing to catch crab to fill its large quota, moved closer to the same grounds being fished by the ''Northwestern''. When Sig Hansen spotted a ''Cornelia Marie'' pot off the bow, he suggested to his crew that they \"mess with it\" as payback for Phil Harris' pre-season comment that he would miss \"beating (Sig's) ass\" under the new IFQ rules. The ''Northwestern'' crew hauled the pot up\u2014\"They've got more crab than we do!\" Edgar observed\u2014then hooked fishing gloves and a pair of thong underwear to the bait hook and welded the door shut before returning the pot to the ocean. As night fell over the fishing grounds, the ''Cornelia Marie'' retrieved the pot and were mystified by the welded door as well as the \"party boy\" underwear in the pot; Phil Harris expressed a belief that \"my fat little buddy Rick (Quashnick, of the ''Maverick'')\" pulled the prank and radioed the ''Maverick'' for confirmation. Captain Rick Quashnick denied his involvement; however, Sig listened in on the conversation over the radio and decided to call Harris and see how long it would take before Harris figured out who really pulled the prank. Once Phil figured out the truth from Sig's denials that he would ever pull such a prank\u2014\"I would ''never'' do such a thing\u2014that would be illegal!\" Sig asserted\u2014the two men shared a laugh about the prank, but Harris got the last word by pulling a ''Northwestern'' pot and filling it with garbage, then mounting a steel pipe over part of the \"shot\" (rope length), which would interfere with the ''Northwestern'' retrieval block and give them a half-ton dead weight hanging off the side of the boat. As the ''Northwestern'' crew pulled their last pots up, they discovered the altered pot; Edgar figured out how to bypass the retrieval block and pull the pot aboard by the pipe around the rope. The ''Northwestern'' crew then discovered that all their crab were taken out of the pot and the pot had been refilled with garbage from the ''Cornelia Marie''; Sig salutes his rival and gives the pipe-over-rope trick a \"9\" on the practical joke scale. The boats returned to Dutch Harbor to offload at the end of the season, one of the first seasons in years with no recorded deaths.\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = A New Hunt Begins\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = The opilio crab season officially began, but a forecast for wind and heavy icing, which can make the vessels top heavy, forced many captains to wait out the storm in Dutch Harbor. As in king crab season, the ''Time Bandit'' threw caution to the wind and left early. The ''Rollo'' fished grounds long abandoned, and after a few pots with only tanner crab, which are out of season, they pulled some pots with respectable numbers of crab. The ''Maverick'' put to sea without longtime deck boss Blake Painter, who took the season off to deal with the impending death of a relative and other family issues.

The ''Northwestern'' crew was less than pleased with Sig's demanding fishing pace, so as a gesture of good faith, Sig left a coffee can marked \"Suggestion Box\" in the galley so that the crew could voice their complaints. Aboard the ''Rollo'', the crew fudged the number of crabs caught per pot; under the IFQ system, quotas are divided between southern and northern shares, so when the ''Rollo'' arrived at processors near St. Paul Island (where the northern share processors are located) and their center tank was opened, the amount of crab in the tank were considerably over the allotted northern share and Captain Eric Nyhammer was assessed a large fine for going over quota. Eric announced to his crew that he was taking the fines out of the crew pay, since they were the ones who had miscounted the crab. As the ''Rollo'' was about to leave St. Paul to return to the southern fishing grounds, they were boarded by the [[Alaska Department of Commerce]] police and informed that under the IFQ rules, they could not leave St. Paul until they emptied all of their tanks, including one of the tanks with crab from the southern fishing grounds, which forced Eric to sell the crabs on board for under market prices. The injured crewman on the ''Cornelia Marie'' was diagnosed with a severe ankle sprain and the boat is forced to return to the fishing grounds shorthanded with Captain Phil Harris's son, greenhorn Jake, taking up the slack; the lack of a fifth man on board slowed the pace of the deck crew by almost 50%. The ''Maverick'' continued to pull full pots while fishing on a sandbar, but as the ice approached, Captain Rick decided to chance leaving the rest of the gear in place and take his northern share up to St. Paul to drop off crab rather than risk losing the crabs that had been in the tank for nearly two weeks.\n |LineColor=EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=22\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=Cashing In\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|6|13}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Time Bandit'' picked up its last string of pots, with mediocre results.

On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', last season's greenhorn, Jake Harris, got a promotion to deckhand; the vessel's new greenhorn is Joshua Harris, Jake's older brother and Phil's eldest son. The new hand on board the ''Northwestern'' is Stan Hansen, cousin to the Hansen brothers; meanwhile, the ''Farwest Leader'' brings Ragnhild Moncrief, the captain's wife, aboard as their new greenhorn/cook/den mother. The '' Maverick'' is now under Blake Painter's control, and his crew is virtually all friends of his who are King-crab greenhorns, with only one experienced deck hand acting as Deck Boss. The crews go shopping for their season's crew provisions, spending around $5500 each trip. At the pre-season captains' dinner, Johnathan Hillstrand proposed a derby-style competition between the boats: Fewest pots needed to pull 100,000 pounds of crab. Sig Hansen upped the ante by proposing each captain kick in $100 for the prize to be given to the winner, and the UniSea Bar agreed to safeguard the $900 bounty. After dinner, the Hansen brothers decided to initiate the first pranks of the season by leaving a bag of bait fish under the Captain's chair on board the ''Maverick''. The ''Cornelia Marie'' left Dutch Harbor hoping to catch a break between two storms, leaving the other boats to ride out the storms tied to the dock. The ''Northwestern'' tried a new strategy of more and bigger crab pots, carrying 150 pots on the initial trip out to the grounds, then returning to Dutch Harbor for 150 more pots afterwards as a way of capturing their very large quota shares at a faster pace. Several captains explained their strategies for setting crab pots in the Bering Sea\u2014Sig Hansen looks at history, checks the official Alaska Fish and Game reports, then sets test pots for long soaks and evaluates patterns of crab caught in the test pots; ''Wizard'' Captain Keith Colburn tries to determine the best balance between history and state reports, noting that many captains spend time \"chasing last year's crab\" and not enough time doing test pot launching and trend watching; ''Cornelia Marie'' Captain Phil Harris noted that when the water is warmer, crabs move northward, but when the water is colder overall, crabs tend to stay in the shallows and it can be hard to determine how shallow is too shallow. Rookie Captain Blake Painter of the ''Maverick'', who had been very confident during the captains' dinner about being able to find the crab on his own, became indecisive about where to drop his pots once the ''Maverick'' reached the fishing grounds and spent most of the first day out at sea \"radio crabbing\"\u2014calling other captains on the radio for tips on where they were finding crab\u2014which annoyed several of the veterans who had cautioned Blake against this very thing. During the first night, the ''Ocean Challenger'' capsized and put out a distress call, and by dawn, only one of the four crewmembers was found in a survival suit.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=24\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=The Unforgiving Sea\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary=The search for the crew of the ''Ocean Challenger'' continued by air and by the [[USCGC Douglas Munro (WHEC-724)|USCGC ''Douglas Munro'']].<ref name=\"Ocean Challenger\">{{cite press release|title=COAST GUARD SUSPENDS SEARCH FOR MISSING CREWMAN FROM OCEAN CHALLENGER|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=October 20, 2006|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/135933/|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref> The bodies of two crewmembers, without survival suits, were recovered, while the fourth crewmember was lost to the sea. The survivor, Kevin Ferrell, tells his story to the Coast Guard. The fleet reacted to the loss of the ''Ocean Challenger''. The ''Northwestern'' set its second load of 150 pots while dealing with a broken hose on the hydraulic launchers. Deck boss Edgar Hansen committed the karmic ''faux pas'' of estimating their catch before it's pulled. The ''Time Bandit'' finally set its pots using [[herring]] instead of [[cod]] for hanging bait with poor results. After a slow start, the ''Maverick'' pulled in full pots and returned to St. Paul to offload. The ''Cornelia Marie'' fished through the night at a fast pace. Rough seas on the ''Farwest Leader'' made greenhorn Ragnhild sick, but she pulled through and worked the deck after losing a bet on the number of crab pulled up in the first pot of the season; although she started out at the bait station loading bait buckets for pots, she gradually got over her fear of the snapping king crab to move to the sorting table and assist in the crab sort and count process.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=25\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Pain and Paybacks\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|17}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' had bad luck with its second string of 150 pots and decided to fish closer to its first set of pots where they had better luck. ''Northwestern'' deckhand Matt Bradley finally confessed to Captain Sig Hansen that he was due to be in court before the official end of the season for an outstanding criminal case that could land him up to eight months in jail; Sig chastised Matt for waiting so long to tell him of this important deadline, reminding him that there was no way to predict when the boat would catch enough to reach its quota. Rough seas caused a crewmember aboard the ''Wizard'' to have his finger crushed between two pots, which required professional medical attention at Dutch Harbor, a return to port which Captain Keith Colburn admitted was going to cost the crew thousands of dollars in lost fishing time but was necessary to avoid costing crew member Lenny Lekanoff his finger. When the ''Time Bandit'' pulled in low crab counts after having to move their greenhorn to the rail due to an injury to veteran crewmember Russ Newberry, the Hillstrand brothers decided to have a little fun at the expense of the greenhorn with a \"flour pot\"\u2014a pot with several trash bags full of flour tied to the rope, which would burst when pulled up through the hydraulic block; the trick worked to perfection as greenhorn Nate put the sabotaged pot's rope into the blocks, only to be covered in exploding white powder seconds later. Captain Blake Painter of the ''Maverick'' received a tip on a hot spot to fish from Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'', but Phil made him promise not to share it with anyone else; however, Blake decided to share the tip with Captain Corky Tilley of the ''Aleutian Ballad'' as a sign that he was willing to give information and not merely take it from other captains, not realizing that Phil was listening in on the same communication band Blake was using. An annoyed Phil got his revenge on Blake's betrayal by sabotaging one of the ''Maverick's'' pots, doing a variation on the ''Northwestern'' welded door trick: The ''Cornelia Marie'' crew emptied all the crab out of the pot (\"Thanks, Blake!\" crew members declared on-camera as they put 50-something keepers in their tanks), put ''Cornelia Marie'' bait boxes into the pot, welded the door shut, turned the pot around backwards and re-strung the \"bridle\" (the loop to which the pot shots are tied for retrieval) through the welded door, then relaunched the pot, with Phil declaring \"That's how you {#bleep#} with somebody, ''Cornelia Marie'' style\". The ''Farwest Leader'' had declining numbers of crabs in their pots, leading Captain Greg Moncrief to challenge his wife Ragnhild Moncrief to pick a better spot for fishing; Ragnhild picked a spot to the northwest of their current position, and was rewarded with a number of full pots pulled in return, prompting the crew to dub her \"Captain Ragny\". The ''Farwest Leader'' crew painted a grappling hook bright pink in honor of Ragnhild's increasing confidence in crabbing, and she got to toss the hook to retrieve one of the pots, snagging the line on her second try. The ''Cornelia Marie'' broke off a part of one her propellers and went to [[King Cove, Alaska|King Cove]] for emergency repairs.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=26\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Cheating Death\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary=The fishing aboard the ''Northwestern'' was excellent and the crew filled their tanks to the brim, though the repetitive nature of fishing 300 pots became exhausting for the crew; on their way to another string of pots, Captain Sig Hansen and his crew discussed whether or not to take a break, with the decision by Sig to keep going, leaving Edgar to comment, \"If Sig had any people skills, they were lost long ago. Only thing that keeps us going is the money.\" A replacement propeller was flown in for the ''Cornelia Marie'', but repairs were delayed because the propeller is left handed, while the ''Cornelia Marie's'' propellers are right handed. Several days later, a second propeller arrived and is installed, allowing the boat to return to fishing, but not before Captain Phil Harris discovered his blood pressure was up in the 180/120 range; when Phil discovered that Jake and Josh had been charging shopping at Dutch Harbor to Phil's accounts, he cut off credit for both of them and blew his stack at them for spending his money so indiscriminately after Phil had just spent thousands of dollars on boat repairs. Jake and Josh both shrugged off Phil's anger, and Jake gave the captain a back massage as a peace offering. Aboard the ''Maverick'', Captain Blake Painter fabricated a temporary fix for a broken [[Dog (engineering)|dog]] on the pot launcher, then retrieved their sabotaged pot moments later; Blake declared the prank pot \"lame\". On their way to [[Akutan, Alaska|Akutan]] to offload, Blake spotted a ''Cornelia Marie'' pot and decided to take revenge by sabotaging the pot with backwards bridles and garbage offloads, but it caused little reaction on the ''Cornelia Marie'' when they retrieved it. On the ''Farwest Leader'', a junior deckhand at the hydraulic controls caused an accident after failing to secure a pot and then broke the crane line, leaving Captain Greg Moncrief to comment to his wife that such accidents were why it was not safe to stand around the sorting tables while the pots were being emptied onto it. After poor results with their test pots, the ''Time Bandit'' pulled all their pots out of their current fishing grounds, changed strategy, and moved north. On the way to the northern end of the fishing grounds, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand observed a deckhand on another boat tying a pot stack off the side of another vessel, the ''Trailblazer''. After the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' headed below for some rest, the man tying the stack was overwhelmed by the 30-foot swells and disappeared into the waves. Captain Hillstrand and his crew worked quickly to save the fisherman who fell into the sea. Their quick action saved the man from certain death, and the fisherman was overjoyed by the swift rescue efforts of the ''Time Bandit'' and her crew. Johnathan and the rescued fisherman were both overwhelmed with emotions after the rescue\u2014ten years earlier, the ''Time Bandit'' had rescued a fishing boat crew in a similar situation but was unable to save one of the fishermen, and the memory had haunted the Hillstrands for years afterward; with this successful save, the Hillstrand brothers said they felt they had finally settled the score with the past for the loss of that fisherman.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=27\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=Bering Sea Salvation\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary=Good fortune smiled upon the ''Time Bandit'' after the rescue of the man overboard as they pulled up very full pots in a once-in-a-lifetime season. The ''Northwestern'' continued to have good luck after offloading nearly $800,000 in crab, though deckhand Matt Bradley was continuing to struggle with the uncertainty about making his upcoming court date. Edgar Hansen painted prison stripes on Matt's oilskins as payback for Matt's continued complaints about not wanting to spend Christmas in jail\u2014\"don't do the crime if you don't want to do the time,\" Edgar reminded the deckhand. Aboard the ''Maverick'', Captain Blake Painter decided to risk striking out on his own and picked a spot to fish without any advice from other captains, resulting in full pots. Lenny, the injured engineer aboard the ''Wizard'', returned to work the deck for the last strings. The ''Farwest Leader'' pulled up empty pots, but pulled up decent pots after receiving a tip from Johnathan Hillstrand on the ''Time Bandit''.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=28\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=The Last Lap\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|8}}\n |ShortSummary=The boats rushed to pull up their last pots in order to meet their delivery deadlines at the processing plants. The ''Farwest Leader'' had one of their best seasons ever, and Raghnild Moncrief celebrated getting over her fear of the big king crabs by holding up one of the biggest crabs for the cameras during the offload at Akutan. Sig Hansen, knowing that the price of king crab will go down in a day, rushed the ''Northwestern'' to Akutan to empty its tanks, pulling in over $1M for his quota shares; more importantly, by getting to port ahead of schedule, Matt Bradley was able to catch a plane that night back to Seattle to avoid missing his court date. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' won the bet between the captains on the fewest pots pulled to 100,000 lbs. by averaging 70 crabs per pot; upon receiving his prize at the UniSea Bar, Johnathan donated a portion of the money to the Seafarer's Memorial fund, and Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' matched it. The ''Maverick'', which had been ahead in the crab-per-pot race the entire season until the ''Time Bandit'' went on their hot streak, \"rail dumped\" several pots thinking that they had reached their quota, only to find out they were actually 4,000 lbs. under quota when they offloaded at [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]]. Blake was very upset and confused by his miscalculation of the load, and, since he was not returning for Opilio season, would have to wait to have a shot at redemption.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=New Beginnings\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|15}}\n |ShortSummary=The fleet began the opilio crab season. ''Northwestern'' deckhand Matt Bradley, who made his Seattle court date in time to avoid a lengthy jail sentence, returned to the ''Northwestern'' crew with his legal troubles behind him. The ''Northwestern'' added a new crew member, greenhorn Jake Anderson, from a multi-generational Norwegian fishing family, anxious to prove himself \"a man\" aboard the most respected ship in the fleet; Sig refused to greet him, as is his tradition with greenhorns. The ''Wizard'' also picked up a new greenhorn, Nick, to learn from greenhorn Crosby. After taking on Jake, the ''Northwestern'' went to pick up their pots stored near St. Paul Island and St. George Island and found that many of their [[buoy]]s had been damaged by playful [[sea lion]]s. The ''Time Bandit'', captained by Andy Hillstrand, headed to a secret opilio fishing spot known only to the Hillstrand family. Out at sea, the ''Northwestern'' crew celebrated Matt Bradley's return to the boat by burning the prison-striped oilskins they made for him during King crab season; Sig was in a considerably less celebratory mood, noting to the cameras that as far as he was concerned, he had done Matt a huge favor by getting him back in time to go to court in the first place, adding that Matt needed to show some respect and gain some maturity. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Farwest Leader'' loaded up on provisions while waiting for the Coast Guard to conduct their inspections and drills. The [[fish processing boat]] ''Stellar Sea's'' engine room caught on fire, causing it to be towed to Dutch Harbor for repairs.<ref name=\"Stellar Sea\">{{cite press release | title=COAST GUARD RESPONDS TO VESSEL IN DISTRESS | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] | date=January 17, 2007|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/135653/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}<br />{{cite press release | title=PHOTO RELEASE COAST GUARD RESPONDS TO VESSEL IN DISTRESS | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=January 17, 2007|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/142236/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}<br />{{cite press release | title=STELLAR SEA \u2013 UPDATE | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] | date=January 18, 2007| url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/142285/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref> The fire forced the ''Cornelia Marie'' and the ''Time Bandit'' to change their plans as they were contracted to deliver to the ''Stellar Sea''. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' decided to dock at St. Paul to wait until the stricken ''Stellar Sea'' was repaired, while Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' decided to switch to fishing [[Chionoecetes|bairdi crab]] which could be delivered to another processor. A Coast Guard [[HH-60 Jayhawk]] from USCG Air Station Kodiak was dispatched to rescue a seriously ill crew member from a fishing boat.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=30\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=Caught in the Storm\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|22}}\n |ShortSummary=The fleet dealt with a storm. The ''Time Bandit'' continued to fish for bairdi with poor results. The ''Farwest Leader'' loaded aboard 30 more pots at St. George, departed before the storm hit, and went fishing for bairdi crab. Aboard the ''Northwestern'', the crew thought their luck had changed when they pulled up full pots, but a mechanical problem with the engine forced them to go to St. Paul for repairs. The ''Stellar Sea'' was repaired and the ''Cornelia Marie'' went out to fish. The ''Wizard'' headed to port for repairs after a wave sheared the gears in the transmission of the forward crane.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=31\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Crossing the Line\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' pulled up full pots as the crew tried to make up for lost time. Although the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn, Jake, was becoming more accepted by the crew due to his eagerness to learn and his rapidly advancing skills, he learned the hard way that playing pranks on the deck boss is never a good idea; in response to Jake's snapping him with a spring-loaded bait hook, Edgar Hansen used cable ties to wrap Jake's [[oilskin]]s into a compact bundle, causing Jake to be late getting back out on deck for the next pot run. The deck crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and ''Time Bandit'' were battered by huge waves. Captain Keith Colburn handed over the ''Wizard'' to his brother, Monte, after having to return home due to a family emergency. The boat also picked up a new greenhorn\u2014Guy, a former rodeo cowboy\u2014after greenhorn Nick injured himself and had to leave the boat, but greenhorn Guy found the work difficult. A wave caused a line to tangle around the starboard shaft of the ''Time Bandit'', forcing the boat to return to port for repairs.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=32\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Trials of the Greenhorns\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|5}}\n |ShortSummary=In rough seas and cold weather that causes ice to build up, greenhorn Guy on the ''Wizard'' hit his breaking point and walked off the deck, leaving the rest of the crew to pick up his duties. Guy complained about a lack of respect from the crew and that there was \"no call\" for taunts that he \"pushes like a girl\" from the more experienced crew members, but Captain Monte chastised him that walking off the deck signaled that Guy was a \"quitter\" who \"couldn't handle the job\" he'd volunteered to do one day earlier. The other greenhorn on the ''Wizard'', Crosby, was amazed by Guy's retreat: \"He didn't even last 24 hours! Come on\u2014you can do anything for 24 hours!\" The ''Cornelia Marie'' hurried to pull up her pots before a severe storm with gale-force winds was due to hit. While pulling full pots, but with mostly rejects, the ''Farwest Leader's'' port engine broke, forcing the crew to shut down the engine and chain the shaft so that the propeller turning from the force of the water itself would not burn out the drive shaft. Captain Moncrief of the ''Farwest Leader'' decided to continue fishing with one engine, but switched from fishing bairdi to opilio crab. Pulling full pots that were set back on the same spot inspired Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' to swap jobs with his brother Edgar and work the deck, something he had not done for over twenty years; each man lasted only a short time at the other's job before both admitting they'd rather be in their regular slots, and switched places once more after Sig successfully pulled fifteen pots. Meanwhile, the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn Jake tried to prove himself by working the rail under \"Sig Rules\"\u2014that is, every miss cost him an article of clothing\u2014and successfully pulled in a string of thirteen pots, though his many misses resulted in him wearing little more than a sweatshirt and long johns by its completion; Jake's willingness to continue learning to throw the hook and retrieve pots earned him respect from both Sig and Edgar. However, Jake then pushed it too far and then learned a lesson on fishing \"old school style\" with no hydraulics and no automated conveyor belts transporting crab to the tanks after Edgar heard him complaining about his aching hands. At Dutch Harbor, Captain Andy Hillstrand cleared a tangled line from the shaft of the ''Time Bandit''. While the work was being done, greenhorn Nate was arrested for an outstanding warrant by the [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] Police and taken to jail; Johnathan and the rest of the crew headed for the nearest ATM to withdraw enough cash to pay Nate's bail so that he could return to fishing.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=33\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Ice and Open Water\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|12}}\n |ShortSummary=After heading north to scout for the January pack ice\u2014and having Edgar leave snow angels and the ''Northwestern'' logo on one of the larger floes of pack ice they encountered\u2014Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' hurried southward to pull his pots before the pack ice reached them. The disgruntled greenhorn Guy on the ''Wizard'' realized that it was not fair to his shipmates to stay inside, while the rest of the crew froze outside, chipping ice from the boat, so he returned to work. The increasingly cold weather and long working hours affected the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn, Jake, and he reached his breaking point, leading to a rare \"pep talk\" of sorts from Sig, which reminded Jake to keep focused on his goals. Fishing on one engine slowed the ''Farwest Leader'', but the boat brought up full pots. However, the captain's decision to carefully sort the crab caused the deck boss, Chilly, to become grumpy, forcing Captain Greg Moncrief to have to face-to-face discipline with Chilly. Captain Andy Hillstrand turned over the ''Time Bandit'' to his brother Johnathan after an emergency required Andy to return to his horse farm in [[Indiana]]. With Johnathan at the helm, the boat pulled up huge numbers of crab, and the crew restacked the gear in preparation for the end of the season after successfully retrieving their quota. Aboard the ''Cornelia Marie'', greenhorn Josh gained new respect for tossing the hook and working the rail after he discovered it is not as easy as it looks. On the ''Farwest Leader'', greenhorn Raghnild cut her hand in the galley and Deck Boss Chilly hurried downstairs with Captain Greg to help her; the distracted crew failed to notice that the launch signal had not been given and launched a crab pot. Unintended launches often cause pots to get accidentally dragged under fishing vessels due to the captain not being able to steer the boat away from the waves near the launch position; when Captain Greg discovered the launch, he had his crew [[keelhauling|keelhaul]] a line from bow to stern to confirm that no pots had gotten tangled underneath. Meanwhile, the ''Time Bandit'' quickly made up time lost due to their own tangled pot line and headed for St. Paul for their final offload, only to run headlong into the dangerous January pack ice.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=34\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=A Frozen Finish\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Time Bandit'' carefully made its way through the pack ice to the processing boat ''Independence'' at St. Paul Island. As the boat tried to leave St. Paul, it ran into too much ice and was forced to return to St. Paul and spend a tense night near the beach where the ''Alaskan Monarch'' ran aground in 1990 in the same conditions. As the pack ice tightened and bay rollers began shoving the boat toward the beach during the changing of the tide, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand sounded the emergency alarms to awaken his crew and ordered all of them to take ice watches\u2014including going down into the holds to watch the ship's walls for puncture marks from the huge ice floes\u2014as he struggled to find a way back to open water. By dawn, the ''Time Bandit'' finally spotted open water and made their way out of the remaining pack ice; the ship's hull was creased and dented but remained intact, and the ''Time Bandit'' headed back to Dutch Harbor. Aboard the ''Wizard'', greenhorn Guy continued to lag behind and left the deck for the second time after being reprimanded by the captain, angrily cursing out the captain and crew and quitting the job for good, voicing his intention to \"jump off the boat\" as soon as they returned to Dutch Harbor. After greenhorn Crosby picked up the slack left by Guy's defection, Captain Monte Colburn decided to give him a 0.5% bonus out of his own share. The ''Farwest Leader'' had a lot of deadloss due to their bad engine slowing their pace\u2014some of their crab had been in the hold for 14 days\u2014but still managed to have a good season. Greenhorn Ragnhild Moncrief of the ''Farwest Leader'' decided that there was no place on a crab boat for a woman because there were so few jobs women could do, and declared she felt as if she had been a \"wasted space\" the entire season despite her notable contributions to the season's success. Aboard the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris and his two sons had their annual line coiling contest and the surprise winner was Josh, the boat's greenhorn. The ''Cornelia Marie'' had a record-breaking season, catching over one million pounds of crab. The ''Northwestern'' packed her holds full of crab\u2014including dumping their entire sea water load to make more room for their last pots of crab\u2014and once again won the dollars earned title, but then busted a hydraulic line on their crane as they worked to restack their last pots. After offloading at Akutan, the ''Northwestern'' crew decided that greenhorn Jake had earned the boat jacket that was his goal for the season, and Captain Sig Hansen gave Jake the jacket off his back and finally gave him the long-overdue greeting and praise for his work, adding that the jacket didn't make Jake a man, but \"it does make you cool!\" The ''Northwestern'' returned to [[Puget Sound]] at the end of the opilio season and were greeted by happy family members.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 4 (2008) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#CC6CFF |overall=5 |season=5 |title=25 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=35\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Get 'Em Back Safe!\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|15}}\n |ShortSummary=On the way to Dutch Harbor from [[Seattle, Washington]], the ''Wizard'' had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} hole torn into the hull after being hit by a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} rogue wave. Relief Captain Monte Colburn had a temporary patch put in place until the ''Wizard'' could be returned to a shipyard for permanent repairs. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son Scott joined the crew of the ''Time Bandit''. In addition to their usual load of supplies and fishing pots, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' loaded a rusted old truck as a practical joke for Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie''. Before the vessels departed for the start of the season, the captains met at the local watering hole to discuss the upcoming season and the ''Wizard's'' close call on the trip to Dutch Harbor. For this season's bet between the captains, whomever hauls in the highest average on a designated 25 pot string will win that week's wager of $100 per captain. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn decided to take on two greenhorns, Jason Moilanen and Lynn Guitard, instead of the usual one, as well as re-hiring last season's resilient greenhorn Crosby LeVeen, who is quick to express appreciation for no longer being the greenest hand on deck. On board the ''Northwestern'', Edgar Hansen oversaw repairs on a bent propeller shaft and bad bearings while the remaining crew members\u2014Norman Hansen, Nick Mavar, Matt Bradley, and returning greenhorn Jake Anderson\u2014stack pots and load gear, but the tension about losing precious fishing time to needed repairs causes the normally friendly group to snap at each other. In a repeat from his antics from the 2006 King crab season, Captain Phil's son Jake went on an unauthorized spending spree with Captain Phil's credit card and buys a [[Flat panel display|flat screen TV]], which does not go over well with Captain Phil. With five hours to go before the start of the season, the Hillstrands made the traditional call to their mother, but she tells them that she had a premonition that tragedy would strike the ''Time Bandit'' this season. The truck aboard the ''Time Bandit'' caused delays in setting their first pots of the seasons. Captain Keith Colburn being unable to follow his superstition about not having an empty [[Cup Noodles]] container to use as a [[spittoon]] delayed their start of the season. The repairs to the ''Northwestern'' prompted Captain Sig Hansen to dig into his archives and try a different strategy and fish further south than the rest of the fleet, but just as the boat is ready to push off from the dock and head out to sea, Captain Sig realizes Jake Anderson is missing. Sig decides to give the young deckhand \"two more minutes\" to return before heading out without him. Jake, whose goal this season is to become a full-share deckhand, races to the docks only to find the ''Northwestern'' has already started to pull away; however, Captain Sig spots him on the docks and maneuvers back to pick up his wayward deckhand (Captain Sig: \"You're lucky I can still back up to get you\u2014where were you?\" Jake: \"Making a phone call...to a girl.\" Captain Sig: \"That was almost a real expensive piece of {expletive}!\"). The ''Cornelia Marie's'' prospect strings come up nearly empty even though they were placed in normally reliable fishing grounds, leaving an already nervous and overstressed Captain Phil now reeling from the loss of his \"honey hole\".\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=36\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Striking Out\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|15}}\n |ShortSummary=A storm front forced the ''Northwestern'' to drop their pots {{convert|50|nmi|km}} short from their planned target in rough seas. The ''Time Bandit'' set their prank on Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' by replacing one of the ''Cornelia Marie's'' pots with the junk truck. When the crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled up the truck, they get a good laugh and then dump the truck overboard. Captain Phil called Captain Johnathan Hillstrand over the radio and gave him an \"A+\" for the prank. Captain Rick Fehst of the ''Early Dawn'' hurried to finish fishing for [[Brown box crab|brown king crab]] so that he could switch to red king crab. The vessel ended the season catching {{convert|784000|lb|kg}} of brown crab worth $1.9 million. The ''Wizard'' picked up another 150 pots from storage, which caused more work for the greenhorns and pushed Jason Moilanen to his breaking point. The ''Northwestern's'' gamble to fish further south did not work out and the crew pulled up nearly empty pots. After pulling up all of this pots, Captain Sig moved north to a different old family fishing grounds. He reminded Edgar Hansen of his ritual of biting the head off a [[herring]] for good luck and hoped following the ritual would bring better luck. The ''Time Bandit'' also had poor luck with their pots, pulling up few crabs per pot. The ''Wizard's'' plan to fish at the northern tip of the fishing grounds paid off with good prospect pots and they dropped their entire 150 pots.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=37\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=A Numbers Game\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|22}}\n |ShortSummary=The family fishing grounds produced results for the ''Time Bandit'' as they pulled an average of 60 keepers per pot for 12 hours. After 19 days of fishing, the ''Time Bandit'' was the first vessel to head to Dutch Harbor to offload. On the way back, greenhorn Scott Hillstrand contemplated his future as a fisherman. The ''Northwestern's'' traditional family ground also produced good results, but greenhorn Jake Anderson's sloppy crab counting angered Captain Sig Hansen. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen scolded the deck crew over not carrying an emergency knife should anybody get caught in a line. As punishment, he makes Jake wear a dead cod on his back. The ''Wizard'' was also on the crab with a string of 300 pots in a {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}} area. However, Captain Keith Colburn noticed that another fishing vessel had navigated a loop around one of his pots and pulled it up to sneak a look at his catch. Captain Keith's call to the suspect vessel went unanswered and he threatened the other captain to not mess with his equipment. Two weeks behind the rest of the fleet because of fishing for brown king crab, the ''Early Dawn'' tried to catch up by dropping 100 pots along a {{convert|50|nmi|km}} string, but this prospect line only pulled up a few cod per pot, causing a drop in morale on deck. After two weeks of poor fishing, staying awake for three straight days, and a 19-hour shift at the wheel, fatigue caught up with Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and he fell asleep, causing the boat to miss two pots. After the crew wondered about two consecutive missed pots, they call up the wheelhouse and wake up Captain Phil. The picking hook's pulley breaks on the ''Northwestern'', which required Edgar to ride the crane up to replace the broken block. Mechanical problems also plagued the ''Wizard'' when a hydraulic line sprung a leak, but a patch was quickly installed by Engineer Lenny Lekonoff.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=38\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Unsafe and Unsound\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the ''Wizard'' worked a {{convert|9|nmi|km|adj=on}}, 55 pot string that Captain Keith Colburn called a \"man killer\". When greenhorn Jason Moilanen was not on deck for the start of the string, Captain Keith gave him some advice on how to cope with the long shifts. After three weeks of bad fishing and with 3 days to catch {{convert|88000|lb|kg}} of crab for a scheduled delivery, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' made radio calls to other captains to get some help on where to drop his pots, but received no answer. With no advice available, Captain Phil gambled on dropping a full load of pots in untested waters. Greenhorn Josh Harris and Deckhand Freddy Maugatai tried to change the boat's luck by shaving their heads into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], but the sacrifice proved ineffective and the ''Cornelia Marie'' continued to pull pots with low counts, and the stress of a bad season began to noticeably affect Phil's demeanor and already high stress levels. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen and Deck Boss Edgar Hansen challenged each other over who could stay awake the longest without breaking. Captain Sig finally offered a truce after he nodded off at the wheel after staying awake for over 47 hours; in response, Edgar led a celebration on deck: \"We broke the skipper!\". At Dutch Harbor for their first offload of the season, the ''Time Bandit'' lost a crew member when Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son, Scott, decided that family was more important to him than fishing and he left to fly home; Scott made the distinct point that Johnathan had been gone for almost all of Scott's childhood, and Scott wanted better for his own children, which wounded Johnathan's pride greatly. A flashback to three weeks earlier detailed a freak accident where Johnathan Hillstrand fell overboard while the ''Time Bandit'' was docked at Dutch Harbor. ''Time Bandit'' Deckhand Eddie Uwekoolani was taken to the emergency clinic where he was diagnosed with a chipped bone in his ankle that required a cast, requiring Johnathan to have to rotate Eddie to a position requiring less mobility while his boat was already a crewman down.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=39\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=No Mercy\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|6}}\n |ShortSummary=On board the ''Wizard'', the \"man killer\" strings continued to produce good numbers with an average of 90 crabs per pot. Captain Keith Colburn decided to push ahead and told his brother, Monte Colburn, to skip his turn at the wheel and go on the deck as soon as he woke up. This caused tension between the brothers and resulted in an argument over Monte's attitude bringing the morale of the deck crew down. In the end, the string filled the ''Wizard's'' hold with {{convert|183000|lb|kg}} of crab and the boat headed back for their first offload of the season. The ''Time Bandit'' finished her first offload of the season and headed on a 28-hour run to a string they left out while they offloaded. A quarter mile from the first pot, the [[Electrical ballast|ballast]] panel on their [[Sodium vapor lamp|sodium lights]] was ripped from the wall and caused a ship-wide power outage. The crew was able to repair the ballast and pick up their string, which had good numbers of crab. Also at Dutch Harbor, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' decided to delay the start of his second run due to his superstition about not leaving on Friday. The first string of the second run proved more productive that any string on the first run when the boat pulled in {{convert|34000|lb|kg}} of crab on this single string. Tensions on board the ''Northwestern'' came to a boil when greenhorn Jake Anderson and Deckhand Matt Bradley came to blows after Matt felt threatened by Jake's eagerness to learn new jobs on deck. On the ''Early Dawn'', Captain Rick Fehst instituted a 20-hour-on/4-hour-off work schedule after having several days of poor numbers. This took a toll on the deck crew, especially greenhorn Bryan Mezich, son of the boat's owner. After pulling up a string, Bryan took a turn at wheel watch in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|60|kn|0|adj=on}} seas while the rest of the crew went to sleep. Bryan dozed off after 10 minutes and the boat was jolted by a wave while he was asleep, waking the crew. An upset Captain Rick wanted to terminate Bryan for this infraction, but was overruled by Bryan's father and he was only given a $500 fine.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=40\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Racing The Clock\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|13}}\n |ShortSummary=After offloading {{convert|180000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $756,000, the ''Northwestern'' raced back to the fishing grounds in order to catch the remaining {{convert|19000|lb|kg}} of their quota in the nine days before their quoted price drops. Although they averaged 60 crab per pot, Captain Sig Hansen, concerned about the volume of crab, decided to follow his hunch and moved to different fishing grounds. The move turned out to be a poor one when the pots in the new territory produced low numbers of crab, causing the deck crew to grumble that they should not have moved. A pin broke in the picking hook pulley aboard the ''Time Bandit''. The broken pulley dropped a steel cable on deck, nearly hitting greenhorn Shea Long. After replacing the pulley, Deckhand Neal Hillstrand had to climb the mast to secure the safety chain to the boom; a task all the more difficult since the ''Time Bandit'' was in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. After low numbers caused low morale on the deck of the ''Early Dawn'', Engineer Mike Fish decided to give greenhorn Bryan Mezich a lesson in humility by letting Bryan tend the rail for the first 20 pots of a 300 pot string that had been soaking for 18 hours. Bryan's first attempts at throwing the hook were off the mark and Captain Rick Fehst put the boat into reverse, an insult to the hook thrower, after three failed attempts. Only after the sixth throw was Bryan able to hook the line. Despite the troubles picking up the first pot, the string proved to be a good one when the pots produced good numbers and the deck crew's morale rose as more crab were brought on board. Six weeks into the season and after convincing his father to allow him to fish for king crab, Captain Sten Skaar and the ''North American'' returned to Alaska after a three year hiatus. Captain Sten hired aboard Captain Erik Nyhammer of the ''Rollo'' (last seen in Season 2) as a deckhand and his crab fishing pots to make this return to king crab fishing. By using borrowed crab pots, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game only allowed Captain Sten two weeks to fish. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Wizard'' offloaded {{convert|183000|lb|kg}} of crab worth nearly $800,000. Before the crew headed back out, Captain Keith Colburn took the crew out for a drink and to pick up a [[Portable toilet|porta-potty]] in order to play a prank upon the ''North American''. In previous fishing seasons, the ''Wizard'' leased the ''North American's'' fishing quota and Captain Keith felt it necessary to play a prank upon Captain Sten when he took back his quota. Captain Keith hauled up one of the ''North American's'' pots and attached the porta-potty to it before dropping it back overboard. The ''North American'' pulled low numbers on their test pots and strings, but thought that their luck had changed after picking up the porta-potty prank. The full pots turned out to be full of female and juvenile crab, which must be returned to the sea, and only a few keepers were in each pot.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=41\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=Seeking the Catch\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|20}}\n |ShortSummary=Heavy seas, lack of proper equipment (no forward-facing sodium lights or crab sorting table), and the crew's inexperience from being away from king crab fishing for three years, made for difficult fishing on board the ''North American'' while it tried to catch {{convert|22000|lb|kg}} of crab to fill their tanks. Under pressure to catch their quota in a limited time, Deck Boss John Skaar's orders to launch pots faster caused conflict on deck when the rest of the crew became concerned that cutting corners was compromising crew safety. Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' decided to try his luck in an area, called the \"Slime Bank\" for the multitude of [[jellyfish]], that he had not fished in over 30 years, but the 60 pot string produced no crab and Captain Keith returned to more conventional fishing grounds. A repaired coiler broke again, forcing the crew to hand coil the lines, but they continued to pull up good numbers in the new fishing grounds. The ''Time Bandit's''' luck at fishing remote, seldom fished grounds was better when the boat brought up {{convert|35000|lb|kg}} of crab in 12 hours, led by perfect hook throwing by veteran deckhand Russell Newberry. When an injured [[cormorant]] landed on deck, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand took him in until the boat returned to Dutch Harbor where wildlife rescuers could tend to him, but the bird disappeared after the crew finished pulling the string. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew pulled up full pots, but the stress of fishing and a tight deadline for a changed offload date took its toll on Captain Phil Harris and he became ill, much to the concern of his oldest son, Josh. The ''Northwestern'' continued to grind through their pots in heavy seas. When greenhorn Jake Anderson hooked another boat's buoy, Deckhand Matt Bradley saved the day by making a [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary toss]] of the hook from the stern of the boat.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=42\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=No Season for Old Men\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|27}}\n |ShortSummary=After a quick offload, the ''Time Bandit'' headed back out to sea with Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son, Scott, back on board after Andy Hillstrand had to return home to attend to personal business. Poor numbers narrowed the contenders for the final week of the Captain's wager made at the beginning of the season to just the ''Time Bandit'' and the ''Wizard''. Battling head-to-head up to the final pot, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' triumphed over Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' with a 75 crab per pot average versus a 65 crab per pot average, respectively. The crew of the ''Northwestern'' kept up their grinding schedule of 20 hour days for the past four weeks up until the very last pot. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen was hit in the head by the picking hook when the boat rolled in the waves and Greenhorn Jake Anderson was unable to grab the hook in time. However, Edgar shrugged off the injury and completed the traditional flaming hook toss to end the season. With 24 hours left in the season and {{convert|11000|lb|kg}} of their quota left to catch, the ''North American'' made a Hail Mary play by dropping their entire 100 pots into a small area after a test pot produced good results. The play worked out and the ''North American'' was able to catch their {{convert|83000|lb|kg}} quota in two weeks. On board the ''Early Dawn'', low numbers caused the crew to call the boat's owner to complain about the poor fishing with greenhorn and owner's son, Bryan Mezich, stating \"the crew prefers if you leased out quota\". The crew got their wish when the boat's owner called Captain Rick Fehst to tell him that the boat's final {{convert|75000|lb|kg}} of the season's quota had been leased out. The last string of the season for the ''Cornelia Marie'' was interrupted by a broken fitting on a hydraulic line on the crane. To repair the crane, Engineer Murray Gamrath had to climb the oil-slicked crane in a snow squall. With the King crab season over, the Hillstrand brothers gathered in their home port of [[Homer, Alaska]] to celebrate and to honor their deceased father, who is buried on a mountain slope overlooking the sea.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=43\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Storm Season\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|3}}\n |ShortSummary=The 2008 opilio crab season started with the ''Cornelia Marie'' returning after a main engine overhaul during the off season, the entire crew of the ''Northwestern'' suffering from the [[influenza|flu]] except for greenhorn Jake Anderson, and the usual change of captains on the ''Time Bandit'' from Johnathan Hillstrand to younger brother Andy Hillstrand. Johnathan's son Scott returned for the opilio season. The fleet left Dutch Harbor ahead of a storm, but the ''Wizard'' trailed behind because it had to refuel before heading out. The traditional biting off of the head of a herring on the ''Northwestern'' was done by deckhand Matt Bradley before Captain Sig Hansen dropped their crab pots on family fishing grounds. After an 8 hour soak and with Captain Andy contemplating a move after the first two strings of a test string produced poor results, the ''Time Bandit's'' third string produced good numbers. With the ''Wizard's'' late start to the season, the boat was forced to ride out {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} seas with a full stack of pots on deck until Captain Keith Colburn to drop 100 pots as soon as the boat reached the [[continental shelf]]. After the ''Wizard'' reached the normal opilio fishing grounds, a broken hydraulic system prevented the boat from dropping their remaining 150 pots. The ''North American'' broke in new greenhorn Darrell Labay to the ways of opilio crab fishing. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', an 8 hour soak on their 180 pots produced great numbers, but two engine warning lights on their newly overhauled engine forced the boat to return to Dutch Harbor. A United States Coast Guard HH-60J Jayhawk was dispatched from Air Station Kodiak to medevac a crewmember from the fish processing vessel ''Island Enterprise''. The helicopter was instructed to fly to [[Cold Bay, Alaska]] where a waiting plane was to take the patient to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], but poor weather conditions made the crew request an alternative flight plan.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=44\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Blow Up\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|10}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the Coast Guard helicopter, en route to Cold Bay with a patient rescued from the fish processing vessel ''Island Enterprise'', were unable to contact their command center. With the threat of ice and a quickly diminishing fuel supply, the pilots decided to change course and return to St. Paul. After a two-hour wait, a private cargo plane, took the patient to [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. The ''Cornelia Marie'' limped to the safety of Zolotoi Bay at St. Paul Island on her one good engine to ride out an approaching storm front. During the night, the strain on the ship caused a dangerous fray in the anchor line. Captain Phil Harris was forced to use his bad engine to help relieve the tension on the cable so that the crew can assess the damage. After a 36-hour run, the ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled into Dutch Harbor, where the crew quickly replaced the frayed anchor cable. The local engine mechanic was unable to determine the engine's problem. The ''Northwestern's'' first pots of the season were a blind drop due to approaching weather, but the boat got lucky and pulled up good numbers. After just 24 hours of working the area, the ''Northwestern'' filled its entire forward holding tank with {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} of crab. The ''Time Bandit'' worked a string of pots placed at the suggestion of Captain Johnathan Hillstrand. When the pots produced poor numbers, Captain Andy Hillstrand moved the ''Time Bandit'' to an old family fishing ground nicknamed \"[[Mr. Magoo]]\". After a long soak time for the pots, the crew hauled in massive numbers to the delight of Captain Andy. On board the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled pots containing large amounts of \"dirty\" crab (crab covered in barnacles), forcing the crew to throw away most of the catch. The low numbers and seeming lack of enthusiasm from the deck crew caused Captain Keith Colburn to lose his cool. Calling in the crew, he lectured them on how hard he has worked to make the ship successful and reprimanded each member for not giving enough effort. Later, after calming down, Captain Keith called in Lenny to apologize for his blow up. However, greenhorn Jason Moilanen, still fuming from the captain's criticism, confronts Captain Keith about how he was being treated, breaking the golden rule of crab fishing to never question the captain. Annoyed, Captain Keith orders him out.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=45\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Big Weather, Big Trouble\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|17}}\n |ShortSummary=An emergency weather warning about an approaching [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] was broadcast to the fleet. At Dutch Harbor, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' opted for the cheaper and easier band-aid repair to one of his engines in order to make it through the rest of the season and then headed back out to the fishing grounds. Heavy seas battered the crew of the ''Wizard''. On board the ''Northwestern'', the boat's crab processor called Captain Sig Hansen to tell him that they bumped the boat's delivery date up two days and wanted a larger delivery. Even though Captain Sig told the crew he would not have them pull two all nighters in a row, Captain Sig agreed to the new delivery date, forcing the crew to work through a second night. The tired crew made a near deadly mistake when they did not dog down a pot on the launcher and it slid off, pinning greenhorn Jake Anderson against the sorting table. Quick work by the crew freed Jake before he was crushed by the {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} pot. On the ''Time Bandit'', Johnathan Hillstrand decided to go out on the deck to work a string before the hurricane hit. While throwing an underhanded toss of the hook, Johnathan missed and the hook hit him in the face, opening a small cut above his nose. In between a run to test pots, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' confronted his son Jake over Jake's work ethic. Just on the edge of the hurricane, the boat fished in {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|100|kn|0|adj=on}} seas, pulling up an average of 800 keepers per pot. But worsening weather forced Captain Phil to quickly dump the rest of his pots and run for cover. After 35 straight hours of fishing, the ''Northwestern'' succeeded in filling all of the boat's tanks in time to make their new delivery deadline.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=46\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=Mortal Men\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|24}}\n |ShortSummary=Three arctic storms converged on the fishing grounds, causing severe damage to many of the boats. The crews raced to repair their boats as another severe storm approached. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris injured his ribs after being thrown from his bunk during the storm. After bandaging his ribs, Captain Phil went to the wheelhouse to continue fishing for the remaining {{convert|34000|lb|kg}} for the scheduled delivery. The crew hauled in good numbers, but Captain Phil's condition began to worsen as he started to cough up blood. Captain Phil decided to keep this a secret from the crew. On the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled in big numbers and Captain Keith Colburn decided to set back the gear in the same spot. This required the crew to step up the pace of work, but greenhorn Jason Moilanen continued to underperform. Deciding that they have had enough of Jason Moilanen, Captain Keith called his brother, Monte, to the wheelhouse to conduct interviews for a new greenhorn and decided to hire Cooper Weatherby. As the ''Time Bandit'' offloaded {{convert|135000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $220,000 at St. Paul Island, Co-Captains Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand decided to reward younger brother Neal for his many years of service by telling him he was no longer required to work on the deck. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil called Engineer Murray Gamrath and confided in him about his condition, worried that he may have an internal injury. Despite some medical attention by Murray, Phil's condition did not improve and Captain Phil called an Anchorage hospital, which recommended that he seek immediate medical attention. Captain Phil decided to ignore the recommendation and continue fishing. Unable to keep Captain Phil's condition a secret any longer, Murray disobeyed orders and told Captain Phil's sons about their dad's condition. Captain Phil's son, Josh, attempted to convince him to head into port and get medical help. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' called Captain Phil seeking advice on fishing, but instead talked about Captain Phil's condition and Captain Keith repeated the recommendation to seek medical attention. Murray's concern led him to tell series producer Todd Stanley to watch over Captain Phil in the wheelhouse and to call him if Captain Phil's condition worsened. Two days after his injury, Captain Phil conceded that his condition was not getting any better and agreed with the crew to head to St. Paul after the gear was set. When the ''Cornelia Marie'' arrived at St. Paul, a storm surge prevented the boat from entering port and they were forced to circle the island. News of Captain Phil's condition spread throughout the fleet. Other captains attempted to call Captain Phil, but he chose to ignore the calls. Sixty hours after his injury, the storm broke and the ''Cornelia Marie'' was able to enter the harbor at St. Paul. A series of [[X-ray]]s suggested that Captain Phil's condition was more severe than broken ribs and a possible puncture lung and that he required examination by a specialist. \n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=47\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=Fresh Blood\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|1}}\n |ShortSummary=After one last cigarette, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' checked himself into the [[emergency room]] at [[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] at 3:00&nbsp;am. The ''Northwestern's'' crew attempted to retrieve the ship's anchor after it snapped off in a storm the night before. Using a [[jury rig]]ged drag hook, the crew attempted to secure the heavy anchor chain, but the ship began to drift in the strong current, which caused the ''Northwestern'' to list dangerously to the side. After four tense hours, the crew finally recovered the anchor. The ''Time Bandit'' pulled into St. Paul Island to pick up new greenhorn Earon Overson. Later as the crew began pulling in their next string of pots, senior Deckhand Russell Newberry taught the new greenhorn how to work on deck and sort crab. With offloading complete, the ''Cornelia Marie'' set off with Engineer Murray Gamrath as relief captain and a new greenhorn, Dan Decker. On their way to Dutch Harbor to offload, a pipe that feeds the after crab tank with fresh water burst on the ''Wizard''. The crew worked together to patch the pipe before it could flood the engine room. After working their first string without Captain Phil Harris aboard and with the crew asleep, Relief Captain Murray called Captain Phil to check on his status. Captain Phil told Murry that he was diagnosed with a [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] that came loose in his leg and traveled up through his heart into his lung, [[Pulmonary Embolism|a condition]] the doctors say could have killed him. At Dutch Harbor, after a slow offload, the crew of the ''North American'' spent a day repairing the extensive damage to the aft deck caused by a rough wave three days earlier. Back at sea, Captain Sten Skaar let greenhorn Darrell Labay work the rail, but the rest of the crew questioned the captains decision on letting an inexperienced crew member work the rail. When Darrell could not keep up, the crew continued to lose respect for him. On board the ''Time Bandit'', their greenhorn Earon's work improved, though he battled sea sickness. After reaching Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn fired greenhorn Jason Moilanen for breaking the cardinal rule aboard ship of never questioning the captain of the boat. The Colburn brothers welcomed Jason's replacement, Cooper Weatherby aboard, who brought along a gift of two Cup Noodles for Captain Keith.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=48\n |EpisodeNumber2=14\n |Title=Changing Tides\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|8}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' offloaded {{convert|184000|lb|kg}} of crab at St. Paul Island, but the growing ice in the harbor made leaving the dock difficult. Captain Sig Hansen wanted to reach his northernmost pots before the rapidly approaching ice pack covered them up. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Wizard'' completed their offload of {{convert|407000|lb|kg}} of crab and headed back to sea. But the trip started on a sour note when Captain Keith Colburn's brother Monte argued with him over relief duties at the wheelhouse. The ''Time Bandit'' worked their fishing ground nicknamed \"Mr. Magoo\" for three straight days, pulling up nearly {{convert|270000|lb|kg}} of crab. With Engineer Neal Hillstrand retired from working the deck, Scott Hillstrand took over operating the hydraulics. Scott's inexperience at the controls made for slower work and he made a rookie mistake when he did not properly dog down a crab pot to the launcher, causing the pot to tip over on deck, nearly hitting a crew member. During one of his morning check-ins with his father, Josh Harris heard Captain Phil question his future as a fishing boat captain. The news lowered morale aboard the boat, but the crew pulled together for a 36-hour shift to pull up 200 crab pots. The ''Northwestern'' reached their pots ahead of the ice pack and after eight hours of pulling pots and breaking ice, the crew managed to retrieve 65 of their 130 pots and pulled in {{convert|45000|lb|kg}} of crab. With an average of 750 keepers per pot, Captain Sig Hansen regretted having to leave the spot after getting everything dialed in, but the danger of losing pots to the ice pack was too great. After the Colburn brothers patched things up between them and the new greenhorn oriented to the ways of the deck, the crew of the ''Wizard'' resumed fishing, but pulled up blanks. On board the ''Time Bandit'', the crew finished up a 72 hour grind, though several pots had to be rail dumped because they contained only female and juvenile crab, which can not be legally fished. With larger swells rolling in, Co-captains Johnathan and Andy Hillstrand went on deck to observe Scott Hillstrand work the hydraulics. When the boat took a roll, Scott lost control of a crab pot and it nearly crushed greenhorn Earon Overson's skull. The ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled in {{convert|120000|lb|kg}} of crab after 72 hours of steady fishing. As a reward for making it through his second 36-hour shift, Deckhand Freddie Maughtai let greenhorn Dan Decker throw the crab hook for the first time.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=49\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Catch as Catch Can\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|15}}\n |ShortSummary=On board the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled up full pots after letting them soak at new fishing grounds for 27 hours. After 36 hours of work, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' finished rescuing their pots ahead of the approaching ice pack. After relocating the pots to safer grounds, Captain Sig Hansen was again on the crab and the boat pulled in good numbers. When a pot was being hauled on deck, a broken bridle on the pot nearly caused Deckhand Nick Mavar Jr. to have his foot caught in the line as the pot descended back to the ocean floor. Quick work by Deck Boss Edgar Hansen saved the pot when he tossed the slack line overboard and put the tail of the line back into the block. Relief Captain Murray Gamrath decided to strengthen the deck crew by hiring aboard Mark Anderson, who had been away from the fleet for over a year after an off season fall. Mark was put to work at the controls of the hydraulics, but the hiatus made him a little rusty at the controls and he caused a pot to swing out of control as it was being pulled on deck. Fishing on untested grounds and with 36 hours to catch {{convert|190000|lb|kg}} of crab, Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' planned to push his crew through a four-day grind until the boat was full. An unexpected wave while pulling a pot caused the line to jump free of the block and to go up over Deckhand Shea Long's head and behind his back, but a quick reaction from him prevented him from being injured by the line. After a 30-hour steam, the ''North American'' arrived at Dutch Harbor for their final offload of {{convert|150000|lb|kg}} of crab. After consulting with the crew, Captain Sten Skaar decided to let go of greenhorn Darrell Labay before the start of the new crab season. Mediocre fishing caused the ''Wizard'' to struggle to fill their last crab tank, which caused the deck crew's morale to drop and tension between greenhorns Lynn Guitard and Cooper Weatherby. \n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=50\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=The Final Hour\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|22}}\n |ShortSummary=With {{convert|145000|lb|kg}} crab left to catch, Relief Captain Murray Gamrath of the ''Cornelia Marie'' received a call about the boat's offload date. With an earlier than expected offload date and cold weather nearly shutting down fishing, the crew hurries to pick up their last pots of the season. In between a 4 hour run to the ''Northwestern's'' last string of the season, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen decided to make a \"deck dummy\" dressed as a crew member to throw off the top of the wheelhouse as a prank against Captain Sig Hansen, but his plan was interrupted when the boat arrived at the string. On the ''Wizard'', the crew spent the last 36 hours, 135 pots, and 70,000 keepers trying to fill the port aft tank, but it continued to take in more crab until the very last pot of the season when it finally appeared to top off. The crew celebrated the end of their season, but unknown to them, the tank once again appeared to settle and was no longer full. On board the ''Northwestern'', the crew did the traditional flaming hook for the last toss of the season. With the last pot pulled in, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen put his prank plan into action, but was foiled when Captain Sig noticed that the deck dummy's legs were crooked and it could not have been a real crew member. The crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' worked through various injuries to pick up their last 180 pots for {{convert|95000|lb|kg}} of crab and headed to Dutch Harbor to offload. Back home outside of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Captain Phil Harris continued his recovery from the blood clot and contemplated his future as a fishing boat captain. The ''Time Bandit'' finished up a 42-hour grind to finish the season and headed to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Andy Hillstrand let greenhorn Earon Overson toss the last hook of the season as his hard work gained the respect of the crew. At St. Paul Island, the ''Wizard'' offloaded {{convert|425000|lb|kg}} of crab. After the port aft tank was emptied, Deck Boss Gary Soper discovered the reason for the apparently bottomless tank; a hole opened up towards the top of the tank, letting crab escape back into the sea. Back at Dutch Harbor, Deckhand Shea Long of the ''Time Bandit'' was unhappy with the prospect of Scott Hillstrand taking over the boat. Jake and Josh Harris reunited with their father in Seattle and Captain Phil discussed the seriousness of his illness and his future as captain. As an epilogue to the season, it was noted that on March 23, 2008, two weeks after the crab season ended, the fish processing vessel ''[[FV Alaska Ranger|Alaska Ranger]]'' took on water and sank, forcing the 47 crew members to enter the water. 42 crew members were rescued by the United States Coast Guard and the sister ship ''Alaska Warrior''. Four crew members perished and their bodies recovered, but one crew member was lost at sea.<ref name=\"Alaska Ranger\">{{cite press release | title=UPDATE: COAST GUARD RESPONDS TO SINKING VESSEL | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] | date=March 23, 2008|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/195965/ | accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 5 (2009) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FF5F5F |overall=5 |season=5 |title=25 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=51\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Everything on the Line\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|4|14}}\n |ShortSummary=The season opens with medical issues for Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard''; a biopsy standing between him and the season. Captain Phil Harris returns to the bridge of the ''Cornelia Marie'' after being away for eight months, but then immediately spends $5,000 on new bait sacks after Jake and Josh lost the sacks from the previous season. The captains gather at the traditional burn barrel and bar where they make the year's captain's wager for $4,000. This year's wager is for the most keepers caught from five specially designated captain's pots. On the ''Time Bandit'', the Hillstrands re-hire deckhand Mike Fourtner, who has aspirations of running the boat when the Hillstrand brothers retire. The Hillstrands play a prank on him as a welcome back by dumping two bins full of water and flour on him. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith receives a call from his doctor that the biopsy came back negative for cancer, but positive for [[epithelial dysplasia]]. During the traditional blessing of the fleet, Captain Phil receives a call from his doctor that the blood clot condition has not completely healed. Reluctantly, Phil decides he must relinquish the captain's chair to Murray Gamrath. The ''Time Bandit'' is the first to reach the southern crab grounds where Captain Johnathan drops two 10-pot prospect pots in a spot that was productive last year. Just as the ''Wizard'' is to drop her first pots of the season, Captain Keith's wife calls with news that the $400,000 in repairs during the off-season has drained his bank account leaving him with a zero balance. The prospect pots return nearly empty and Captain Keith decides to move on. On the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen draws the [[Drawing straws|short straw]], though actually a short [[zip tie]], to do the traditional biting off the head of a herring. On the ''Wizard'', a pot is lost when the line snaps. Captain Keith suspects a jagged edge of [[zinc]] [[anode]] is cutting the lines, and the only way to be sure is for Captain Keith to dive under the boat or return to port. Captain Keith made the decision to do the risky dive, but as he is ascending from under the boat, the boat rolls; he sustains a head injury, and has to be lifted back aboard in a life sling. Last year's hot spot for the ''Time Bandit'' is just as hot this year when the first pot of the prospect string hauls in 96 keepers; seeing such great results, Captain Johnathan blankets area with all of his pots.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=52\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Red Skies in the Morning\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|4|21}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the ''Wizard'' tends to Captain Keith Colburn, but it is too early to tell if he is seriously injured from bumping his head on the underside of the boat. After another test string results in a full pot, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' drops his entire load of pots in the hot spot from last season. After getting eight hours of sleep, On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith takes over the helm even though he does not remember most of what happened during his accident. The skippers notice the [[Weather lore#Red sky at night|red sky in the morning]] and the leading edge of a monster storm reaches the fleet at 10:00 AM with the ''Northwestern'' getting hit first. Her crew continues to fish through the leading edge of the storm, when Captain Sig Hansen's wife calls with a weather report of approaching {{convert|40|kn|0|adj=on}} plus winds from the east. Captain Sig decides to push as hard as he can before the storm hits. The ''Time Bandit'' consolidates her entire 197 pot load in a {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area. Relief Captain Murray Gamrath steers the ''Cornelia Marie'' to pick up a {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} long string of 90 pots after a 48-hour soak, but instead of the 60 average keepers he was expecting, he gets only a few crab per pot. With such low numbers, Captain Murray orders the crew to stack the gear and heads off to a second string {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the north. He also receives a phone call from Captain Phil Harris asking him how the fishing is going and providing Captain Murray with a report that Captain Johnathan of the ''Time Bandit'' was averaging 80 to 90 keepers per pot. On board the ''Northwestern'', a broken pot catches the line while being dropped overboard, causing two pots to get tangled, but the crew slowly works to clear the problem. The ''Cornelia Marie'' hits the southern edge of the storm and where 60 pots were dropped to the north, but while the pots look good at first, most of the crab are females or juveniles. The crew grumbles about the lack of crab and Captain Murray has no plan on where to go next. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to pull up good numbers, filling up their tanks with nearly {{convert|30000|lb|kg}} of crab, but the 36-hour grind causes the tension to rise between Mike Fourtner and Russell Newberry. The fleet gets hit by the post-tropical remnants of a [[typhoon]] from Japan that produces {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} seas and {{convert|60|kn|0|adj=on}} winds. At 12:37 AM on October 22, 2008, the crab fleet hears a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday call]] from the ''Katmai'', a cod fisher with 11 men on board, that she is sinking, but the ship is {{convert|900|mi|km}} west of the fleet and the skippers are too far away to assist. The [[United States Coast Guard]] launches an [[MH-60 Jayhawk]] and two [[C-130 Hercules]] from USCG Air Station Kodiak to the location of the ''Katmai''{{'}}s [[EPIRB]]. After a seven-hour flight, the MH-60 Jayhawk arrives on scene and locates the EPIRB, a flare, debris, and an empty life raft, but no survivors. At 1:00 PM, the Jayhawk crew spots a survival suit in the water, but the [[rescue swimmer]] reports that the crew member is deceased.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=53\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Stay Focused or Die\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|4|28}}\n |ShortSummary=Seventeen hours after ''Katmai''{{'}}s [[EPIRB]] went off, a second [[MH-60 Jayhawk]] arrives on scene and picks up four survivors from a life raft: Captain Henry \"Joe\" Blake, Deck Boss Guy Schroeder, and Greenhorns Harold \"Ryan\" Appling and Adam Foster. Captain Joe, Ryan, and Adam recount their survival story aboard the life raft. Facing the worst of the storm, the ''Wizard'' is low on fresh bait and pulls a string of cod pots in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|75|mph|km/h|adj=on}} ([[Beaufort scale|Force 12]]) seas. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen keeps news of the ''Katmai'' tragedy from the crew. After going 36 hours without sleep, Captain Sig hands over the helm to Deck Boss Edgar Hansen and he steers the ''Northwestern'' on setting a string. After a 27-hour soak, the string pulls up good numbers, lifting the spirits of the crew. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Deck Hand Corey Eisenbarth recounts his experience when he was a greenhorn aboard a fishing vessel that went down 26 years ago. Nineteen hours after the ''Katmai'' sinks, two Good Samaritan vessels, the ''Courageous'' and the ''Patricia Lee'' pull the bodies of two crewmen from the sea.<ref name=\"Katmai 1\">{{cite press release|title=*Update* 2 missing fisherman recovered, Search continues for 2|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=October 22, 2008|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/234044/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026093243/http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/234044/|archivedate=October 26, 2008}}</ref> Four days after the sinking, the United States Coast Guard suspends the search for the two remaining missing crewmen.<ref name=\"Katmai 2\">{{cite press release|title=Coast Guard Suspends Search for Missing Katmai Fishermen|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=October 26, 2008|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/235898/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719115208/http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/235898|archivedate=July 19, 2009}}</ref>\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=54\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Put Up or Shut Up\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|5}}\n |ShortSummary=While on a 45-minute run to another string, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' receives a call from the cannery that his delivery deadline has been moved up three days, leaving 36 hours to fill the boat. On board the ''Wizard'', Monte Colburn is upset that Greenhorn Josh Warner had posted a picture of him and his girlfriend near the bait station. Monte smears bait over the photo, which prompts Josh to leave the deck and complain to Captain Keith Colburn about the issue, but he receives no sympathy and is told to get back to work. Captain Wade Henley and the ''Lisa Marie'' arrives at the southern end of the fishing grounds two weeks after the rest of the fleet because she was fishing for cod for a month. The smallest boat in the fleet at {{convert|78|ft|m}} long can only carry 40 pots, which she drops overboard for a prospect string. On the ''Northwestern'', steady but mediocre numbers make Captain Sig Hansen happy, but his mode changes when the cannery calls to tell him that they have moved his delivered day up a day, leaving less than 72 hours to catch {{convert|50000|lb|kg}} of crab. His mood continues to darken when the fatigue of the deck crew, who have been working for 17 hours non-stop, causes them to slow down and make mistakes. The ''Time Bandit'' pull up a 75 pot string with low numbers putting their push to fill their quota in time for delivery in jeopardy, but two large pots push them over their {{convert|117000|lb|kg|adj=on}} full load and they head back to port. On their way to pick a cod fishing string, Deckhand Jake Anderson of the ''Northwestern'' receives permission from the crew and Captain Sig to man the hydraulics for the first time. When Captain Sig comes out of the wheelhouse to caution Jake about going too fast, Edgar Hansen becomes unhappy about Captain Sig stepping across the line of responsibility from the wheelhouse to the deck. After dropping her 40 pots overboard, the ''Lisa Marie'' anchors at [[Amak Island]] to take cover from the storm where she is joined by the ''Cornelia Marie''. Captain Murray Gamrath of the ''Cornelia Marie'' is relieved from the wheelhouse after being on duty for 39 hours straight. Deckhand Corey Eisenbarth notices that the boat is drifting due to the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} swells and {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} winds and wakes up Captain Murray so that he can captain the boat while they pull up the anchor. The anchor line gets caught on the outside of the pulley. Corey manually works the line free while Captain Murray engages the engines to relieve the stress on the line.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=55\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=Long Haul, Short Fuses \n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|12}}\n |ShortSummary=After a 30-hour grind and with 8 hours to spare, the ''Time Bandit'' sets their final 35 pot string before heading to [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul]] to offload. The crew gets a reminder on complacency when a rogue wave knocks a pot off the launcher, nearly crashing into Deckhand Russell Newberry before it goes over the side. After seven days of fishing on barren grounds, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' makes a major move by baiting heavy and moving to new fishing grounds, but his plans are delayed when he discovers that the boat is low on bait. Captain Keith decides to call out to Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' to ask for bait, hoping that Captain Sig follows the unwritten rule of \"whenever somebody needs help, regardless of who it is and what is, you help them out\". Continuing to haul up low numbers and with only {{convert|150000|lb|kg}} out of {{convert|200000|lb|kg}} for a full load, Captain Murray Gamrath calls the crew to the wheelhouse that he is going to take the ''Cornelia Marie'' up north {{convert|80|to|95|mi|km}} in search of better numbers. Despite their low numbers, Captain Sig of the ''Northwestern'' decides to not move and stick it out. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen calls out Deckhand Jake Anderson about how he is prepping the crab pots. Jake takes the criticism personally and his attitude annoys Edgar. The ''Time Bandit'' offloads {{convert|121000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $609,000 at Saint Paul. Also experiencing miserable fishing, Captain Wade Henley considers moving the ''Lisa Marie'' up north, but the boat's small deck would mean multiple trips which would eat up fishing time. Captain Wade decides to move up north {{convert|50|mi|km}} instead of {{convert|80|mi|km}} where he was told over the radio that there was good fishing. Later that night, the crew pulls up a test pot after a 7 hour soak that results in no crab. The lack good fishing causes tension among the crew to rise, culminating in Deckhand Robert Christensen shoving his brother Greenhorn David Christensen to the deck after Robert's toss of the hook gets caught in a shot line that David was coiling. Working on an 80 pot string with two days before having to make a delivery and on a 36-hour grind, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' gets careless. Jake Anderson handles the crab roughly on the sorting table, causing Edgar to call out Jake once again. When Deckhand Matt Bradley joins in on calling out Jake, tempers flare between the two. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew drops 141 pots on new grounds. Tensions are also high among the Harris brothers, with Jake and Josh arguing over Josh's filling of the bait jars. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to pull up full pots. Another close call on deck happens when a bridle breaks while pulling up a pot, but a quick reaction by Deckhand Mike Fourtner to throw out the line from the coiler prevents anybody from getting caught in the line and pulled overboard. Mike's luck doesn't hold when he loses two hooks overboard. The crew manage to retrieve the second hook with some luck and jury rigged hook made of two shackles. With only {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} of bait on board, Captain Keith leaves his brother Monte Colburn at the helm while on a run to pick up some cod pots. Monte spots a herd of [[walrus]] and Keith is upset that Monte did not wake him as the superstitious Keith sees the walrus as a good omen. Keith drops a string of pots exactly where the walrus herd was spotted. After a 24-hour soak, the walrus herd turns out to indeed be a good omen as the crab pots are full and the ''Wizard'' fills her tanks full. The ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s move {{convert|100|mi|km}} north does not turn out when she pulls up a disappointing string of pots.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=56\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Deadline \n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Wizard'' is being helmed by Monte Colburn as she fishes in {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, {{convert|100000|lb|kg}} short of her quota. At first pots in the string are full, but the count quickly drops off. The ''Northwestern'' drops 86 pots on a third string in new fishing grounds. As she heads back to the other end of the grounds, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen needles Deckhand Jake Anderson, which upsets him. The bad feelings chill when a wave crashes on deck, hits Edgar and Jake, and knocking Edgar off his feet. The ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s bad luck continues when she only gets 45 keepers out of 25 pots. Hoping to change their luck, Deckhands Josh Harris, Jake Harris, and Freddy Maugatai try their new tradition of shaving their heads into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]. After pulling up mediocre numbers for the past three days, the ''Time Bandit'' heads to their last string of the season. The string starts off good, pulls up a blank on the third pot, but the last few pots have good numbers, allowing the crew to meet their quota of {{convert|270000|lb|kg}} of crab. Captain Johnathan Hillstrands plots a course back to Dutch Harbor to offload. On board the ''Lisa Marie'', crew morale sinks when a string after a 20 hour soak pulls up mostly female crab. The crew must stack and move their 60 pots for the third time in two weeks. Deck Boss Robert Christensen berates Deckhand Brandon Williams. Brandon then goes to Captain Wade Henley to tell him that this will be his last trip on the boat because he feels that he is not getting the respect that he deserves. After the mediocre numbers that Monte Colburn picked up through the storm, Captain Keith Colburn packs five strings in a {{convert|2|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area back where he saw the herd of walruses. The plan works out when the crew pulls of pots with large numbers of crab. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Time Bandit'' offloads her catch. Captain Johnathan has caught over $1.7 million worth of crab. The crew celebrate the end of the king crab season by smashing several whipped cream pies in the face of Andy Hillstrand, who will be captain during the upcoming opilio crab season.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=57\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=Down to the Wire \n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|26}}\n |ShortSummary=The final week of the king crab season sees the crew of the ''Wizard'' pushing to pull up their last 20 pots of the season. They get good numbers of keepers and head to Dutch Harbor to offload. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen is radio fishing in English and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but Deck Boss Edgar Hansen is skeptical of any advice received over the radio. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is finally on the crab, but their long trip makes Relief Captain Murray Gamrath worry that the crab in the tanks might be towards the end of how long they can survive. Deckhand Jake Harris has an injured back, but when brother Josh tries to help out, Josh ends up injuring Jake's pride and they argue over their duties on deck. The brother soon make up when the boat averages 30 keepers per pot. With {{convert|200000|lb|kg}} in their tanks, the ''Cornelia Marie'' begins the 30-hour trip back to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Sig on the ''Northwestern'' makes a gamble by dropping three 50-pot \"[[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]]\" strings on the radio information he received, but the pots bring up lousy numbers and the crew has to continue to grind through the season. With their season completed before the other boats, the Hillstrand brothers of the ''Time Bandit'' go fishing in [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas|San Carlos, Mexico]]. Just outside Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' calls Greenhorn Josh Warner up to the wheelhouse to congratulate him on a good job during the season and to offer him a job during the upcoming opilio season. First Mate Gary Soper initiates Josh to the crew by playing a practical joke on him. As the ''Wizard'' is being offloaded, Engineer Lenny Lekanoff surprises the Colburn brothers by telling them that he is retiring after fishing for 25 years. The ''Northwestern'' picks up their last \"Hail Mary\" string and the crew celebrates by shooting off fireworks, but Captain Sig is worried that the Coast Guard will interpret the fireworks as [[Flare|signal flares]]. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Cornelia Marie'' offloads their crab. The crew is dismayed to find a lot of dead loss due to the boat being out too long. The crew makes one final trip out to dump the dead loss over the side. Captain Sig of the ''Northwestern'' barely makes his delivery deadline and the cannery haggles with him over the price of the crab. Two weeks after the season ends, the captains gather to settle the Captain's Wager. The wager comes down to a single pot between the ''Time Bandit'' and the ''Wizard'', with the ''Time Bandit'' winning. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand splits the winnings with the crew.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=58\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=Payback Time\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|2}}\n |ShortSummary=The beginning of the 2009 opilio season is greeted by an ice storm in Dutch Harbor. On the way to the fuel dock, the ''Wizard'' loses power and drifts east of [[Hog Island (Aleutian Islands)|Hog Island]]. She regains power before drifting into the rocks of Hog Island and heads back to her dock to diagnose the problem with her fuel system. Captain Phil Harris returns to the helm of the ''Cornelia Marie'' after an 11 month break from fishing due to this [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] from last season. The ice storm has delayed Captain Sig Hansen's, of the ''Northwestern'', arrival at Dutch Harbor for two days. Before the start of the king crab season, Deckhand Jake Anderson of the ''Northwestern'' pulled a prank on Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' by stealing Captain Johnathan's signature U.S.A jacket. The Hillstrand brothers seek revenge upon Jake at the start of the opilio season. Jake decides to spare the crew of the ''Northwestern'' from possible retaliation by going on board the ''Time Bandit'' to return the jacket. However, the Hillstrand brothers still decide to punish Jake by taping him to the ''Time Bandit''{{'}}s crane and dipping him waist-deep into the sea. The weather clears enough for Captain Sig to fly into Dutch Harbor on the day that the opilio season starts. Captain Sig and Captain Andy Hillstrand visit Captain Phil on the ''Cornelia Marie'' to discuss the ice situation on the fishing grounds. Captain Phil hires mechanic Jeff Whited to check over the ''Cornelia Marie''. He finds a leak in the fuel tank that needs immediate repair in a [[drydock]]. While drydocked, a problem with the propeller is discovered. Steve Ward replaces Murray Gamrath as engineer after Murray decides to retire from fishing. Steve finds a water leak in the hydraulic system that needs repair. The three repairs total up to a $100,000 bill. With the impending ice storm, the captains of the ''Northwestern'' and ''Time Bandit'' decide to offload some pots to make for a safer boat and then head off to the fishing grounds. The ''Wizard''{{'}}s loss of power is traced back to a leak in the fuel tank. The tank is drained and ventilated to allow Monte Colburn to weld the leak as a temporary fix to get the boat through the opilio season. Instead of taking off pots like the ''Northwestern'' and ''Time Bandit'', Captain Keith Colburn decides to take a full load of 235 pots and rig up a tarp across the front of the stack to prevent freezing spray from building up on the stack. The ''Time Bandit'' arrives at the same fishing spot in the northern area of the fishing grounds as last season and drops her first strings. Captain Andy has four days until his delivery date to fill the boat and wants to launch his pots as fast as possible. The Hillstrands hire on new Deckhand Jon Jorgenson even though they still need to cut one crew member at the end of the season. The extra hire means that six crew members are competing for five spots. The ''Northwestern'' drops her pots further north than the ''Time Bandit''. Deckhand Jake Anderson does the traditional biting off of the head of a herring to start the season. Captain Sig drops three 40-pot strings just {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of the ice and hopes that the ice does not cover his pots before he can retrieve them. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' decides that 235 pots is too many and departs Dutch Harbor with 225 pots. After three days in drydock, the repairs on the ''Cornelia Marie'' are complete and she heads off, but not before Captain Phil decides to give his son Josh a full share. Brothers Jake and Josh Harris argue while they load the pots onto the deck. After a nine-hour soak, the ''Time Bandit''{{'}}s first string pulls up low numbers, which forces Captain Andy to scramble for a new plan before the ice arrives at the fishing grounds in two days. The ''Cornelia Marie'' arrives at the fishing grounds with Captain Phil planning to fish near the ice pack. In {{convert|50|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, the crew of the ''Wizard'' works on the bow of the ship to lash down the tarp. Captain Keith calls for an abort of the work, but the crew does not hear him and the boat takes a big wave which engulfs the crew.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=59\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=No Second Chances\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|9}}\n |ShortSummary=Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' calls to his crew on the bow after a big wave crashes over the bow engulfing the crew. After not hearing anything, Captain Keith rushes down from the wheelhouse to find that Monte Colburn has injured ribs from being thrown against the drag anchor, Deckhand Lynn Guitard with a contusion above his left eye and lower back, and First Mate Gary Soper with a contusion below his left eye. With half the crew injured, the ''Wizard'' turns back to Dutch Harbor. The Hillstand family fishing ground nicknamed \"[[Mr. Magoo]]\" does not produce any crab unlike last season. The crew of the ''Time Bandit'' rail dumps the pots dropped on \"Mr. Magoo\" and head to their northern strings {{convert|60|mi|km}} away. After offloading {{convert|152000|lb|kg}} worth $258,000, the ''Incentive'' is fishing on the southern fishing grounds {{convert|80|mi|km}} from the sea ice in the middle of an arctic squall with {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} gusts, and {{convert|-10|F|C}} temperatures. While pulling up full pots after 18 hours of work, a pot slips from the launcher, but the crew avoids injury. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' agonizes over his decision to send his crew out on the bow. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris plans a short soak strategy in order to beat the ice. With two new crew members on deck, the crew has yet to get into a good rhythm. When new Engineer Steve Ward is slow stacking the pots on the deck, the Harris sons push him to work faster. This results in a dressing down by Captain Phil to his sons about working together. With three days to go until their delivery date, the ''Time Bandit'' arrives at their northern family fishing ground nicknamed \"butt cheeks\". Trying to break their bad luck, the crew set fire to the Jake Anderson, of the ''Northwestern'', dummy they made when paying Jake back for stealing Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's jacket. The crew's luck changes as the crew pulls up three-quarter full pots after a 21-hour soak. Captain Andy Hillstrand decides to concentrate all of his gear on the \"butt cheeks\" fishing grounds. The ''Northwestern'' is on the crab, pulling an average of 400 keepers per pot {{convert|55|mi|km|adj=on}} from the sea ice. A {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} wave crashes over the port side of the boat, snapping the pot tie downs at the stern of the boat, causing the pots to shift to the starboard side. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew finally gets into a rhythm and their short soaked pots pull up good numbers. Captain Phil must decide on whether to stay and fish and risk being caught by the ice or make a run to St. Paul to offload while the weather is clear. While launching a pot, Jake Harris gets his leg caught in the line after it pops free from the block. Quick work by his brother, Josh Harris, frees Jake's leg before the descending pot pulls him overboard. After a 20 hour steam, the ''Wizard'' arrives back at Dutch Harbor and the injured crew receive medical attention.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=60\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Sea of Misery\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|16}}\n |ShortSummary=Six hours after offloading $352,000 worth of crab, the ''Northwestern'' is hauling up a 100-pot string after a 48-hour soak. The ice pack has moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} south in the past 36 hours, putting the ice {{convert|40|mi|km}} away from the ''Northwestern''{{'}}s northern strings. The crew rush through hauling up the southern string before moving {{convert|15|mi|km}} to haul the northern strings. Captain Sig Hansen has the ''Northwestern'' on the crab, getting an average of 500\u2013600 crab per pot, and wants to move west {{convert|.75|mi|km}} before resetting the pots to keep the fishing fresh and ahead of the crab, but the crew questions Captain Sig's decision not to set back on the same spot like previous seasons. Still docked at Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' has second thoughts about his decision making process regarding the accident that injured three of his crewmembers. The boat heads out with a full crew with retired Engineer Lenny Lekanoff and injured First Mate Gary Soper rejoin the crew. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is picking up the last 120 pots of her northern string, getting 500 keepers per pot, when Captain Phil Harris receives a radio report of an approaching storm with {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. Captain Phil puts the crew into overdrive to finish picking up the string and head to St. Paul for offload before the storm arrives. The ''Time Bandit'' arrives at St. Paul an hour ahead of her scheduled delivery time with approximately {{convert|90000|lb|kg}} of crab on board. The tired deck crew hits their racks during offload, but nobody is assigned to take notes of the offload to check the cannery's numbers. The cannery reports that they have taken off {{convert|85000|lb|kg}} of crab and the crew can not confirm that the cannery is short two brailers. The discrepancy and lack of attention earns the crew a dressing down by Captain Andy Hillstrand. The ''Wizard'' finally drops the first pots of her season on the southern end of the fishing ground. Captain Keith notices that the ''Northwestern'' and several [[Trident Seafoods]] boats are in the area and he becomes concerned that he may be dropping on areas that have been fished out. While steaming for an hour to their northern strings, the ''Northwestern'' builds up {{convert|6|in|cm}} of ice on her deck and the crew spend the next four hours breaking ice. The ''Wizard'' crew offload their 204 pots in {{convert|60|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. Captain Keith is still having doubts on the decision to fish and his confidence is shattered when Lenny is knocked off his feet by a wave. Even though Lenny is okay, Captain Keith calls off launching of the remaining pots on deck. The ''Time Bandit'' crew pick up right where they left off when their first string of their second trip of the season averages more than 700 keepers per pot. {{convert|10|mi|km}} out from St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie'' is inching her way through the sea ice. Below decks, Engineer Steve Ward notices a small leak in the port crab tank circulation pipe. While grinding away the rust around the leak to attempt a repair, the leak grows bigger, setting off alarms. The crew, who had been asleep on the run to St. Paul, wakes up and heads below to help Steve apply a temporary patch to the pipe.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=61\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Lockout\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|23}}\n |ShortSummary=Working three consecutive 30-hour shifts, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' is pulling their northernmost string of 25 pots in a {{convert|4|mi|km}} line before the ice arrives. However, before the crew reaches the end of the string, the boat encounters the leading edge of the ice pack. The first buoy in the ice pack has moved {{convert|3|mi|km}} from where it was dropped. Captain Sig Hansen decides not to press his luck with the ice even though the pots are getting good numbers and moves his pots further south away from the ice. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is {{convert|2|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul when Captain Phil Harris decides that he can wait no longer and to push his engines to the limit to get through the ice blocking St. Paul. Only {{convert|.75|mi|km}} from the dock, oil begins to pour from the port engine and Captain Phil is forced to shut down the engine and use only the starboard engine. After two hours, the crew ties up at the dock. Captain Phil makes a call to his mechanic in Dutch Harbor to see if he is willing to fly out to St. Paul to fix his engine so that he can go back out to retrieve his pots before the ice pack swallows them. Twenty-one days into the season, the ''Wizard'' pulls up her first prospect string of the season, resulting in good numbers. Captain Keith Colburn receives a call from his brother, Monte, updating Keith on Monte's injury suffered at the beginning of the opilio season. The ice filled the harbor at St. Paul and trapped the ''Cornelia Marie'' against the dock, but Captain Phil's mechanic has caught the last flight into St. Paul and began work on the engine. The ''Incentive'' fishes into the night in {{convert|70|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} seas with not very good results. A line breaks free of the block, snapping the line against Deckhand Doug Dawson's arm, but he escapes serious injury. After 11 hours of work, the mechanic determines that the number six cylinder of the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s port engine is the cause of the failure and it will cost $67,000 to repair. Fishing is back to normal on board the ''Wizard'', but the pace takes a toll on the greenhorns. Josh Warner leaves the deck to take a nap, and later goes up to the wheelhouse to tell Captain Keith that he is thinking of leaving the boat due to feeling humiliated by the veteran crew members. Captain Keith encourages Josh to stick it out for the rest of the season. The ''Northwestern'' has moved south onto new, untested fishing grounds. A 30-hour soak results in good numbers. Captain Sig feels momentary tightness and acute pain across his chest, but he chooses to keep it from his crew and he continues on at the helm. After five days trapped at the dock in St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s engine is repaired and there is an opening in the weather to allow her to leave. After receiving an observation on the harbor ice conditions from a United States Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk that was overhead, Captain Phil cautiously steers the boat clear of the ice in the harbor and plots a course to retrieve their northern strings before the ice pack arrives.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=62\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=A Slap in the Face or a Kick in the Butt\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|30}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' has {{convert|10000|lb|kg}} to fill her tanks before her offload in 24 hours. Suffering from a cough, Captain Sig Hansen decides to try to quit smoking for a day. An arctic front approaches from the north, bringing {{convert|30|ft|m}} seas which make for a very wet deck. Captain Sig gives up on quitting smoking after three and a half hours. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to bring in good numbers after the fourth set back of pots in \"butt cheeks\" fishing grounds. Her crab tanks are packed full of crab and she heads back to St. Paul to offload. Two days after leaving St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie'' arrives where her pots should be, but does not find them. Captain Phil Harris must run around in circles to locate his pots. On board the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn's nerves are still frayed from the incident earlier in the season and he has been fishing in calmer waters which results in lower numbers of crab. Greenhorn Josh Warner is sleeping when the rest of the crew are eating and is slow coming out on deck. Captain Keith calls Josh up to the wheelhouse to give him an ultimatum to decide what he wants to work or quit. Before heading to offload at St. Paul, the ''Time Bandit'' makes a detour to look at the ice pack. Captain Andy Hillstrand finds that the ice pack is moving faster towards he gear that he is expecting and he must decide to either go move his northernmost pots or make a run to offload and hope that the ice pack does not reach his pots. Captain Andy decides to gamble and make the run in to offload. The ''Cornelia Marie'' managed to locate all 180 of her pots that were scattered by the sea ice. Moving to new grounds, Captain Phil claims that he can see bubbles and smell the \"crab fart\" in the water and drops a 30-pot prospect string. Headed to St. Paul, the ''Time Bandit'' finds that the ice pack is further south than Captain Andy expected. She must slowly make her way through the ice in St. Paul Harbor and use her crane to move the ice between the boat and the dock before she dock. The ''Northwestern'' has also found the ice pack on her way back to St. Paul. When she arrives, the St. Paul [[harbormaster]] calls to tell Captain Sig that the harbor is closed due to the ice. The ''Northwestern'' must drop anchor and wait out the ice. The ''Wizard''{{'}}s numbers are picking up as she hauls up the last lots of her first trip. Greenhorn Josh's work attitude is also picking up and he tells Captain Keith that he is ready to go for a second trip. Retired Engineer Lenny Lekanoff has only agreed to go on a single trip to replace the injured Monte Colburn. Captain Keith leaves a message for Monte to see if he is well enough to come back on board. After a 35-hour soak, Captain Phil Harris' theory about the \"crab fart\" appears to be true as the ''Cornelia Marie'' crew pulls up good numbers on the prospect string. The ''Northwestern'' has been anchored off St. Paul for the past three days and the crew is beginning to worry about dead loss from the crab being on board for ten days.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=63\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=Ends of the Earth\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|7|7}}\n |ShortSummary=Anchored {{convert|2|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul harbor, Captain Sig Hansen decides that the four days he has already waited is long enough, heads into the harbor and pushes his way past the ice. Safely docked at the pier, Captain Sig hopes that he can offload before the harbor ices up again. The ''Incentive'' pulls up full pots of \"dirty\" ([[barnacle]]-encrusted) crab and must rail dump them overboard as the cannery will refuse the dirty crab. With three days until a delivery date, over {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} left to go, and no keepers in the string, Captain Harry Lewis decides that he must move north. As the ''Wizard'' offloads {{convert|411000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $560,000 at Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn drives to the airport to pick up his brother Monte who has returned against doctors orders with five broken ribs and new Greenhorn Jon Lawler. With the new crew and Engineer Lenny Lekanoff back into retirement, the ''Wizard'' heads back out. In {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas and {{convert|-30|F|C}} temperatures, the ''Incentive'' arrives at the northern fishing grounds and sets her pots before a storm arrives. When ice builds up on deck to dangerous levels, the crew must stop setting pots and break ice. At the southern fishing grounds, the ''Wizard'' picks up her gear to head north {{convert|5|to|10|mi|km}}. While Monte may be back on board, his broken ribs limit him to manning the wheelhouse and Captain Keith must go out to work the deck. Captain Keith has not worked the deck in over 15 years and shows the crew that he is still capable of working the deck. His time on the deck shows to him that he starting to get over the incident with his crew at the beginning of the season. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' returns to the \"crab fart\" fishing grounds. High tides make for difficult conditions hooking the buoys, but the crew manages to pull the pots on deck with an average of 600 keepers per pot. Captain Phil decides to set back on the same spot. Captain Phil notices that Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' has set his pots in the middle of the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s gear. The ''Incentive''{{'}}s first northern string averages 500 keepers per pot. With the temperature dropping to {{convert|-40|F|C}}, the crew begins to suffer [[Hypothermia|Stage 1 hypothermia]] and crab begin to drop their legs when they freeze. After hauling up 45 pots, the temperature continues to drop, but the crew must grind on with another 150 pots to haul. The ''Northwestern'' has returned to the finishing grounds after being stuck in St. Paul harbor for two days and the crew rushes to pull pots before their next delivery deadline. The twenty-hour grind with poor numbers makes the crew grumpy, but Captain Sig shows no sympathy. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' calls Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' over his view that Captain Keith set his gear over the top of ''Cornelia Marie'' gear. Captain Keith's view is that he did not intend to set his gear over the ''Cornelia Marie'' gear and that the tide moves the ''Wizard''{{'}}s gear. A storm generating {{convert|60|kn|adj=on}} and {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas hits the ''Wizard'' as she pulls up the 60 pots in the area. A {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} crashes over the bow, knocking Greenhorn Jon Lawler from the sorting table and wedging him under the launcher.

On deck, a slip by Greenhorn Jake Anderson nearly causes him to be crushed under a pot being brought on board. On board the ''Wizard'', Greenhorn Josh Warner tells Captain Keith Colburn that he will be getting off the boat at the end of this trip so that he can see his brother who is shipping off to [[Iraq]]. Captain Keith decides that a distracted Josh is a liability on deck and pulls him off the deck. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is back to averaging 600 keepers per pot now that she is no longer sharing fishing grounds with the ''Wizard''. Greenhorn Ryan Simpson accidentally steps into the crab tank, earning the rest of crew a case of beer when they get back into town. The crew of the ''Wizard'' is working a 15-hour grind with big numbers. A radio call alerts them about the approaching ice pack, forcing the crew to stack their pots on deck and move to different grounds. The ''Time Bandit'' has returned after two days to the pots she had dropped {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the ice pack before running to an offload. However, at the designated spot, the pots are nowhere to be found. After some searching, Captain Andy Hillstrand locates their pots and gets good numbers from them. He decides to set back on the same spot. On board the ''Northwestern'', Deckhand Nick Mavar, Jr's wife calls with the news that Jake's sister, Chelsea Dawn Anderson, has died. Nick tells the news to Jake and the ''Northwestern'' heads to St. Paul so that Jake can go home to be with his family. After a 47-hour shift, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' hits the rack. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand is at the wheel monitoring the ice pack that is {{convert|5|mi|km}} from their northern pots. When he receives a radio report on the movement of the pack, he rouses the crew so they can move all 80 of their pots before the ice pack reaches them. The 80 pots do not have enough crab in them to fill the boat and they must reset all 80 pots away from the ice pack. The ''Northwestern'' is {{convert|1|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul when the crew transfers Jake to another boat that is heading into port to offload. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen tells Jake that they will not likely hire somebody to fill his spot and they will work a four man deck.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=65\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Day of Reckoning\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|7|21}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Wizard'' is headed to Dutch Harbor to offload scheduled in 20 hours in heavy seas and with an iced over stack on deck. Captain Keith Colburn orders the crew to drop 40 pots from the top of the stack as the seas pick up to {{convert|35|ft|m}} and {{convert|70|kn|adj=on}} winds. The ''Time Bandit'' has 80 pots to pick up to finish off the last of her {{convert|40000|lb|kg}} quota before she heads to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Andy Hillstrand orders the crew to measure the remaining space in the middle tank, the crew ignores him. An angry Captain Johnathan Hillstrand goes on deck to do the measure himself and yell at the crew, in particular Mike Fourtner. After Captains Andy and Johnathan yell at the crew, the last pot of the season is hauled on board by a very subdued crew. After a 17-hour run, the ''Time Bandit'' arrives at Dutch Harbor where she offloads the last of her $900,000 quota. With too many deckhands on board, Captain Johnathan fires Deckhand Russell Newberry. Captain Johnathan makes a radio call to Captain Keith on the ''Wizard'' to see if he needs another deckhand. The ''Northwestern'' is trying to make up time lost from the run to St. Paul to drop off Jake Anderson. She has 72 hours to get the last {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} of her quota. The pots pull up good numbers as the weather gets colder. The ''Wizard'' arrives at Dutch Harbor where she offloads {{convert|375000|lb|kg}} of crab. Greenhorn Josh Warner asks Captain Keith if he could have a spot on the boat if he returns in September, but Captain Keith tells him that he will not bring him back on the boat and to pack his bags. With an arctic hurricane due to hit the grounds by the end of the day, the ''Northwestern'' crew is hurrying to get all 150 of their pots on board. Low numbers of keepers put their timeline in jeopardy. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' meets with Russell Newberry and hires him for the rest of the opilio season. Russell packs up his gear on the ''Time Bandit'' and heads over to the ''Wizard''. The crew of the ''Northwestern'' works their 50th straight hour to bring up the last of {{convert|10000|lb|kg}} of crab, capped off with the traditional flaming hook for the last pot of the season. With offload complete, the ''Wizard'' heads back out to sea. Captain Keith wants to drop all of his pots before the arctic hurricane hits with full force.

The ''Time Bandit'' has hired Jeremy Shelton as a greenhorn, and he takes the early hazing very well. On the ''Northwestern'', Edgar, who begins work on his 39th birthday, is suffering physically from years of abuse crabbing, putting Captain Sig in a tough position. The ''Cornelia Marie'' begins the season in a repair dock, needing to repair the hull, propellers and drive shafts after running aground on a reef. Paul Edgrin is the new greenhorn on the ''Wizard'', and is already acquainted with Captain Keith. Captain Bill has something to prove, and three new deckhands, on the ''Kodiak'' after a terrible king crab season.

The other boats who leave later quickly ice over, and have to begin chipping ice and dumping pots very quickly. The ''Time Bandit'' doesn't bother baiting their first few strings. Jeremy is incredibly seasick. The ''Kodiak'' makes it to its target grounds, but the frozen-over stack creates a challenge. When the ''Wizard'' reaches its grounds, the weather reminds Keith of a year previous, when he nearly lost his crew to a rogue wave, so he makes sure the crew is extra careful.

To make matters worse on the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson accidentally cuts his wrist, joining Edgar on the injured list. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is worried about the performance of greenhorn Paul, wanting a greenhorn to actually last through a full season for once. On the ''Kodiak'', numbers are actually good for once, but one of the greenhorns, Clint, is messing things up. Captain Bill warns deck boss Adam to get the greenhorn in gear, or he'll find a replacement at Saint Paul. The ''Cornelia Marie's'' first string is bone dry. This wears quickly on Captain Phil, who is suffering three crushed discs in his back.

Eventually, Jake can take no more with his injured hand, and walks off the deck, putting his career in jeopardy. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil heads to the \"Rock Pile\", a very tricky ground that made him famous early in his career. Although his first two strings miss, the third string finds its mark and the boat stuffs its tanks. While moving its pots to a new ground, the ''Time Bandit'' starts listing starboard due to freezing spray, and water gets into the rusted rails and the fuel tanks. They manage to filter the water out of the fuel and get their pots cast off to eliminate the list. Greenhorn Jeremy finally makes it on deck to begin working, but after a long bout of seasickness his mind isn't into it, and he eventually gives up. On the ''Wizard'', the crew plays a prank on greenhorn Paul, who has been lagging, by locking him into a pot and taking him for a ride on the crane. But with bad fishing at the time, Captain Keith doesn't appreciate the timing of the prank.

After spending several days fighting freezing spray and ice, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' begins pulling up decent numbers. Warmer weather makes deck conditions hazardous as large chunks of ice fall from the deck crane. On the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig attempts a dangerous nighttime transit of the narrow break-water into St. Paul harbor in order to offload. While in port, Jake Anderson goes to the island clinic and returns to the boat with a splint on his hand, putting his future on the boat in question. After leaving the harbor, Jake calls one of his sisters while on wheel watch to talk about his father, who has been missing for three weeks. Captain Sig gets the call saying that Jake's father's car was found abandoned on a remote logging road, letting the secret out. The ''Cornelia Marie'' finishes their record string on the 'Rock Pile' and steam for St. Paul. Along the way, Captain Phil begins to experience pain and 'strange sensations'. Unable to bear it any longer, he briefly abandons the wheelhouse to go down to his cabin, the captain's stateroom, for a pain pill. Phil discovers his youngest son, Jake, in his cabin in the act of stealing Phil's medication. Angry and emotionally hurt over this turn of events, Phil tells Jake, \"a liar and a thief\", to get out of his life. Jake begs for his forgiveness, claiming that he is \"sick\". Phil begins to realize that this was more than a simple case of theft and asks Jake in what way he is sick, with Jake admitting that he has a drug addiction.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=76\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Blown Off Course\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary=After Jake Harris revealed his addiction to Captain Phil on the ''Cornelia Marie'', he swore he would go to rehab when the season was over. Phil told Jake that he had to get help in order to save himself, and swore his support. On the ''Time Bandit'' Captains Johnathan and Andy contemplate their future. Johnathan in particular is starting to ponder retirement, and has decided to take three weeks off. Believing Johnathan's son, Scott, will eventually captain the boat, they agree he is not yet ready. They decide instead to train Mike Fourtner as a relief captain, due to his greater knowledge and experience. On the ''Wizard'', bad fishing causes Captain Keith to resume using [[chewing tobacco]], which he promised his children he would give up. It is right then that Keith's 11-year-old daughter calls and he admits to her that she caught him red-handed. Keith gets a gentle chastising and pep-talk from his daughter while the camera zooms in on several reminders she had made for him around the wheelhouse, renewing his resolve to quit. He remarks after hanging up that she is 11 going on 21. On the ''Northwestern'', the fate of Jake Anderson's father still weighs on his mind. Eventually, Captain Sig tells him to call his mother, who relates the news she earlier told Sig that his father's truck was found, but he is nowhere to be seen. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil ponders Jake Harris' addiction on the steam to Saint Paul, seeing a lot of his own formative years in his younger son. He determines that Jake must put aside hard living for hard work to do what Phil knows he is capable of; one day taking over the business. Later, at Saint Paul as they offload, Phil shares some old family photos with Josh and Jake, putting the earlier confrontation with Jake aside for the moment and remembering happier times when the boys were young children. Phil then retires to his stateroom before the offload is complete. When offload is complete, engineer Steve Ward is unable to reach Phil on the shipboard phone, so he goes up to the wheelhouse to get Phil's signature. Finding it empty, Steve checks down in Phil's stateroom and finds him collapsed on the floor. Phil has suffered a massive [[stroke]], unable to move the left side of his body but still conscious. Jake breaks down as paramedics work on him, then move him off the boat by crane before loading him into an ambulance. Josh rides with his father to the island's care center, certain to be medevaced later.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=77\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=Empty Throne\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|29}}\n |ShortSummary=All quiet on the ''Cornelia Marie'' as the crew heads to the clinic 2 hours after Captain Phil's stroke. He's going to be medevaced to Anchorage with Jake, as Josh begins planning for the boat finishing its season without him. Josh later gets an update from Jake, who tells him that Phil will have a portion of skull removed to relieve the pressure. While seeking advice, Josh talks with Deckhand Freddy Maughtai, who urges Josh to fly down to Anchorage and be with Phil and Jake. Josh, however, feels that his father would want him to take care of the ''Cornelia Marie'', his legacy, in his absence and that he owes his old man to do so. Freddy tells him that if Phil dies and he isn't there, he will regret it for the rest of this life. \"Season every year... crab every year... Dad, no. There's only one Dad, bro. The crab is always catch. We always make money, every year. But we cannot catch a Dad every year.\" Freddy reveals how his own father died in the hospital in [[Australia]] while he was out during an opilio season with Phil; his aunt called to inform him, and he went home not seeing his father but a dead body. He leaves Josh with his thoughts, making his decisions much harder.\n\nThe ''Time Bandit'' begins pulling a new string as Captain Andy starts training Mike Fourtner as a relief captain. His first string of five pots doesn't bring up good numbers. On the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson is torn between wanting to go search for his missing father, and his family desiring him to remain on his boat. The crew suffers a near-miss when a pot snaps free of the crane, and Jake is able to save the pot, but Sig admonishes him to let it go next time in case a hook is swinging free. Sig doesn't mind having to buy another pot in such a situation; his crew's safety is worth more than any pot. On the ''Kodiak'', the crew finally sees good numbers as they approach their first opilio delivery date. But the crew is being dragged down by deckhand Clint, and Wild Bill has to put him in his place. Despite early counting issues, they hit their first delivery with crab to spare, and Wild Bill gives his crew some shore leave, only requesting that they don't have any hard liquor. He's worried Clint won't make the midnight curfew, but the entire crew misses it, and it's Jake that has the issues in the morning, not Clint.\n\nThe first evening after Phil's stroke, Josh begins notifying the crews, telling Captain Andy first. Andy relays it to Johnathan, in case he's passing through Anchorage on the way stateside. When Sig finds out from Andy, he throws his cigarettes away across the wheelhouse in a fit of anger. Andy and Sig inform their crews; Jake Anderson takes it particularly hard, knowing what the Harris boys are going through possibly losing their father. Sig passes it on to Captain Keith, who breaks down upon hearing the news. Josh finally decides to fly to Anchorage, where Captain Johnathan, who went to the hospital after being informed by Andy, picks him at the airport and takes him there to join Jake.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=78\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=Cain and Abel\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|6}}\n |ShortSummary=After 12 hours of surgery, the neurosurgeon who worked on Phil Harris has a grim prognosis as he shows the results to Josh, Jake, and Johnathan Hillstrand. Although survivable, the location of the stroke makes a fatal complication possible, and he anticipates a very long road to recovery.\n\nOn the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson continues to ponder his missing father as the rest of the crew deals with broken bodies. The crew takes a break to celebrate Jake's six months of sobriety from a situation pre-season. Their next delivery date is jeopardized as they hit a nursery and draw low numbers of keepers. Edgar Hansen feels the job is killing him, and is feeling the end of his career drawing closer with each grind. Sig overhears Edgar's personal concerns, and thinks if he's close to quitting, he should get serious about training a replacement. Sig thinks Edgar's problem is that he's the one everybody goes to on the deck. The ''Wizard'' grinds through ice on the north side of the crab grounds to get some ice-covered strings pulled. Frequent calls from his daughter try to keep Captain Keith in line regarding kicking his tobacco habit. The crew gets breakfast as Keith and Monte try to work through the ice. Keith sees a seal. They find clear ice, and their pots. They also manage good numbers, convincing them to gamble and keep fishing there. The ''Kodiak'' returns to the grounds and takes to its soaking pots. The numbers are outrageously good, and the crew is finally clicking. But when the numbers dry up, some pots show they weren't properly secured, allowing crab to escape. Wild Bill chews out his crew after the string, then calls in reinforcements, prepared to fire one of his crew if things don't shape up. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Andy is losing focus with his brother keeping watch over Captain Phil. The crew pulls crab pots in \u221230\u00b0F weather, conditions cold enough to make the crab fall apart before they get in the tank. To make it worse, everyone is sniping on Mike Fourtner, since he's being groomed for the captain's chair.\n\nA day after surgery, with more friends in town, Captain Phil is making progress, and is breathing on his own again. He manages to be able to speak as well, and cons Jake into giving him an ice chip early. Three days after surgery, those around him are really feeling down with his vulnerable condition. Josh and Jake are regularly arguing about things, with Jake seeing Josh as being more concerned about the ''Cornelia Marie'' than their father, but Josh seeing Jake as drowning his sorrow in alcohol and drugs and not really caring about anything. Johnathan just happens to come up to the brothers hotel room and catches most of the shouted argument through the door, which saddens him as he goes back down to the lobby. Jake leaves the hotel angry, and Johnathan talks with Josh. Meanwhile, Derrick Ray takes over as relief captain on the ''Cornelia Marie'', and the boat finally gets back underway.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=79\n |EpisodeNumber2=14\n |Title=Redemption Day\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|13}}\n |ShortSummary=The show begins with Captain Johnathan calling Captain Andy with positive news on Captain Phil's progress. Andy passes it throughout the fleet to their excitement.\n\nAfter Jake and Josh Harris's confrontation in the previous episode, Josh goes to Captain Johnathan for advice. Johnathan tells Josh just to be there for Phil and deal with his business himself; he may feel that Jake is also his responsibility, but it really isn't. Back on the ''Time Bandit'', Mike Fourtner's jitters with the hook continue, and Scotty Hillstrand is eager to prove himself in Mike's place. On the ''Northwestern'', bad numbers continue to lengthen their grind, which only makes the crew miserable and long for home. In Anchorage, the neurologist tells Josh to begin making preparations to move Phil to a rehab facility in Seattle, though the actual move is still some time away as they wait for the rest of his swelling to go down. Bad numbers are plaguing the ''Kodiak'', and deckhand Clint continues to be seen as a thorn in the crew's side. Wild Bill, tired of the crew as a whole, makes a call ahead to hire a new deckhand. The ''Time Bandit'' goes to a new prospect string, where Scotty proves no better at the hook than Mike. Captain Andy's gamble on a deeper string is an utter bust. Andy and Neal determine that making the crew hate the Captain is better than allowing the crew to turn on each other.\n\nIn Anchorage, Jake Harris broods over his demons, and calls a substance abuse clinic in Seattle to admit himself into rehab. He goes to Phil to tell him. Phil is proud of his son for finally getting the help he needs. Captain Johnathan and Josh take him to the airport to fly home to Seattle.\n\nA storm brews in the Bering Sea, and the ''Northwestern'' hopes to finally catch some luck. Ready for a break, Edgar begins to train Jake Anderson on the hydros. After a good amount of luck, he finally slips a pot out of the dogs, and it slides into the crab table without toppling. In Dutch, the ''Kodiak'' offloads another 210,000 pounds of crab, and picks up a new deckhand, Randy. But he talks to the crew before Wild Bill actually fired somebody to make room. After finishing the offload, Wild Bill fires Clint to make room for Randy.\n\nIn Anchorage, Phil tells Josh he regrets not being there as much as he wanted to, but Josh shows no regrets for his upbringing as he says that Phil taught him everything that he needed to know to be a man. During their exchange, Josh breaks down and has to step out, not wanting his dad to see him cry. On another day, Phil asks Josh to go get his good-luck bracelet from his hotel room when he returns in the evening. As a furious arctic storm pounds the fishing grounds, Phil deteriorates rapidly, and Josh is summoned to the hospital. Despite doctors' best efforts, Phil succumbs to complications of his stroke.\n\n{{center|Captain Phil Harris<br />December 19, 1956 \u2013 February 9, 2010}}\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=80\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Valhalla\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|20}}\n |ShortSummary=As the storm rages through the crab grounds, hauling pots gets really complicated on the ''Northwestern''. As numbers dwindle and weather worsens, the risk outweighs the reward and Captain Sig gives up, willing to take being up to 4,000 pounds short over losing some or all of his crew. In Saint Paul, where the ''Cornelia Marie'' is still preparing to get underway, Freddy Maugatai is in the wheelhouse when Josh Harris calls to pass along the news that Captain Phil had died. Breaking down, he heads into the engine room to inform the rest of the crew, and he and Steve Ward share a moment of tearful consolation. An eerie calm passes over the crab grounds, and the captains, who don't know of Phil's fate yet, express their concerns.\n\nMost northern of the ships right now, the ''Kodiak'' works in frigid conditions in an attempt to fish the edge of the ice pack. Although Wild Bill doesn't regret getting rid of deckhand Clint, having two new deckhands doesn't help when the air temperature is \u221240 \u00b0F/C and visibility is 15 feet. Poor returns from the pots prompt a northward trek. Due to the freezing temperatures, the hydraulic system onboard develops a problem. Deck boss Adam shuts down the hydraulic system for repairs, inadvertently endangering the oblivious crew above when a pot suspended from the now-paralyzed deck crane swings uncontrollably before it can be tethered. The broken hydraulic line is replaced and fishing continues.\n\nThe ''Time Bandit'' needs to fill two of its three tanks in the next 48 hours. The crew seems to be working better, and the numbers improve as well, giving hope that they will make the next delivery. Jeremy hauls bait hard, and Captain Andy decides to teach him how to throw buoys. But his arms are so sore, he can't throw them very far, and one gets caught on the rail, potentially endangering the boat. To the west of Saint Paul, the ''Wizard'' sees good fishing along the ice pack. The problem is, Captain Keith sees the crew getting nonchalant about their jobs. He comes down from the wheelhouse to give them a pep talk, telling them to speed up the process so they can plug the tanks and get back in. Deckhand Lynn Guitard continues to lag behind and gets messy with tying up the stack, prompting an additional talking-to from Keith at the wheelhouse window.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' gets into Saint Paul early, 10 hours before its delivery time. After some downtime with the crew, Captain Sig goes to the ''Cornelia Marie'' to introduce himself to relief captain Derrick Ray. It is here that he finds out that Captain Phil is gone; it was the same evening Derrick found out. The galley of the ''Northwestern'' is somber after Sig relays the news to his crew, who fights their emotions. The word spreads quickly from there through the crews. As the ''Northwestern'' leaves, they slowly pass the ''Cornelia Marie''. Jake Anderson breaks down as they salute the boat. Andy comments that it's time to retire his American flag on the ''Time Bandit''; the storm has ripped it into a barely recognizable tangle of fibers. He compares it to the season in general.\n\nIn Seattle, Phil's family gathers for his funeral service. Among the mourners with Jake and Josh are their mother and Phil's father. His ashes are placed in two motorcycle fuel tanks. One is buried in Seattle at his funeral; Jake and Josh plan to spread his ashes from the other during the next King Crab season. The ''Time Bandit'' has a moment of silence. On the ''Northwestern'', Sig mentions the tale that seagulls carry the spirits of lost sailors; he reckons that one sitting on the bow at that moment might just be Phil. On the ''Wizard'', a tearful Keith oversees as the crew loads a full crab pot, packing its shot and buoys within so it stays on the bottom as a memorial, so Phil will always have a full pot to come back to. The ''Time Bandit'' memorializes Phil in their own typical style: by setting off their fireworks. The final shot sees the ''Wizard'' send their pot over as Keith tolls the ship's bell eight times.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=81\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=Endless\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|27}}\n |ShortSummary=The boats make their final pushes of the painful 2010 opilio crab season. The ''Time Bandit'' replaces its torn-up U.S. flag. Their plan is to set gear one more time, pick up Captain Johnathan, then go pick their gear up. The ''Northwestern'' crew is finally beginning to break. The ''Cornelia Marie'' picks up Josh Harris, who is determined to finish the year, as Captain Phil would've wanted. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is concerned with plugging his tanks one more time to meet his quota. Wild Bill on the ''Kodiak'' is rushing through his gear, hoping to get one more set of strings pulled before the ice pack swallows them. He is gambling on only using the smaller orange diver pots on his final set of strings, to minimize the risk of the ice moving them.\n\nOnce Captain Johnathan returns to the ''Time Bandit'', he and Captain Andy deliberate on how big Mike's ego grew when he got a taste of the captain's chair. One night on the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig is unable to sleep, with Captain Phil on his mind. Edgar is long since over this season, and continues to train Jake Anderson on more aspects of the deck. They get good enough numbers to pack the pots away. Sig finally realizes that he'll need to eventually find a replacement for Edgar. Back on the ''Time Bandit'', Mike and Scotty continue their feud. Andy fuels it by putting Scotty back on the rail. He snags the first buoy, but Mike drops it. Their first pot doesn't look promising, and it also falls out of the dogs. Later pots have better numbers, giving hope that this set of strings will be their last of the season. Captain Johnathan joins the deck crew to help sorting, and they clean house with a final total of $1.2 million.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' is officially on its final pots, finishing with a total of $990,000. To honor Captain Phil, they throw several flaming hooks for the final pot, which is totally stuffed with crab. As for the ''Kodiak'', they have to cruise through the ice pack for the final set of 30 pots. He moves quickly through the gear hoping for good numbers. He gets the numbers he's looking for, and finally secures a good season. The gamble paid off, with a final opilio tally of $1.6 million. On the ''Wizard'', they are back in the crab as well, ending up with crab oozing back on the deck. Captain Keith gives Lynn Guitard the final hook throw, rewarding him for cleaning up his act. He ends up shanking a long throw, but nails a retry without needing to turn around. The crew finishes with earnings of $1.8 million on a record haul.\n\nBack on the ''Northwestern'' on its final steam to Dutch Harbor, Edgar notifies Sig that he needs a break so he can take care of his family. He makes it clear he's putting his wife and children ahead of the boat from now on. Sig still doesn't believe Edgar will give the boat up. As for Jake Anderson, he'll fly ahead to finally address his missing father. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Andy tells Mike Fourtner to be mindful of his ego next season as he is given more time in the captain's chair. Jake Harris heads to an addiction clinic in Palm Springs, California.\n\nTen weeks later, in April 2010, the ''Cornelia Marie'', with Josh Harris heading a four-man deck and Captain Derrick in the wheelhouse, finally finishes its opilio season. Josh is determined to remain in the fishery for the foreseeable future.

Phil's ashes are placed in a crab pot and then dropped into the sea (which according to Josh Harris was his fathers' wish), and the crews set off fireworks (and a few guns) into the air. The ''Kodiak'', the ''Time Bandit'', the ''Northwestern'', the ''Wizard'', and the ''Cornelia Marie'' (now under Captain Derrick Ray) are joined this season by two new boats: the ''Seabrooke'' (Captain Scott Campbell, Jr.), and the ''Ramblin' Rose'' (Captain Elliot Neese).<br /><br />The season is barely under way but tensions are already running high. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', still in dock at Dutch Harbor, Jake & ships' mechanic Steve go on a shopping trip without letting Captain Derrick know. On their return Derrick & Steve get into a shouting match that nearly escalates into a physical confrontation. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith listens to a distress call from cargo vessel ''Ever Unique'' regarding a crew member with a broken neck. The Coast Guard medivac chopper is dispatched to retrieve him, and despite the size of the massive ship, has a difficult time finding a suitable spot to lower their man. On the ''Northwestern'', it is teased that Edgar Hansen has left the boat, with Sig wondering where his \"baby brother \" is. Edgar eventually is seen and begins work for his 23rd season. Meanwhile, Jake runs back and forth between the deck and the kitchen trying to have a meal ready for the crew who are confronted with a potentially work-ending issue with the crane. On the ''Seabrooke'', problems are less serious: an empty coffee pot. While the coffee pot may be empty, they find full crab pots. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan's tactic of setting on scallop beds does not pay off. On the ''Wizard'', a pot is lost when the line gets caught in the propeller. The rest of the pots come up empty, forcing Captain Keith to rethink his plans. Captain Derrick & Steve have agreed to set their issues aside and focus on fishing, and the ''Cornelia Marie'' finally leaves Dutch Harbor. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', Captain Elliot is upset when his crew parties all night and leaves a mess for him to clean up. In a meeting in the wheelhouse the other crew members blame Naiuli, and Captain Elliot decides to kick him off the boat.\n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=83\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Proving Grounds\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|4|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Cornelia Marie'' and the ''Ramblin' Rose'' struggle to catch blue king crab.

On board the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn moves to a spot last used during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but still can not find the crab. Concerned about his brother being on the stack, Captain Keith orders his brother Monte to take greenhorn Paul Edgren up on top to train him. When the crew grumbles about Paul slowing down the deck, Captain Keith pulls the entire crew from the deck and berates them about not following his orders. The ''Northwestern'' gets good numbers from their first string of the season and sets back. Still on the crab, the ''Seabrooke'' also sets back.

Josh Harris asks Captain Derrick Ray for assurance that they will find the crab. Egged on by the crew, Jake Harris asks for and receives time at the helm. Then next day, when he asks for a second time at the helm, Captain Derrick Ray tells him no when he believes that he smells marijuana on Jake. Two weeks into the season with low numbers, Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' pulls out all of the superstitions to catch crab in an area called Black Canyon, but the good luck doesn't come and the boat continues to pull in low numbers. Greenhorn Paul Edgren gets caught up in the line of a pot, but the crew saves him from going overboard. Seeing no sign of changing numbers, Captain Keith decides to move to where his partner boat has good fishing. The numbers caught by the ''Seabrooke'' drop off, causing Deck Boss Bob Perkey to grip about Captain Scott \"JR\" Campbell. Junior decides that Bob has to go once they reach port to offload their red crab quota. Bob's son, greenhorn Kyle Babb also voluntarily leaves the boat. Hoping to break their own bad luck, the crew of the Time Bandit fires an [[AK-47]] and [[AR-15]] at a buoy named after former deckhand John Jorgensen who left the boat after the previous season, but their prospect string produces low numbers and the crew move on to a different fishing spot. \n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=85\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Breaking Point\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|5|3}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Seabrooke'' takes on an enthusiastic new greenhorn before heading off to go blue crab fishing. After two hours of fishing, the greenhorn enters the wheelhouse complaining that he has reached his mental breaking point after being hazed by the rest of the crew. On board the still struggling ''Cornelia Marie'', tensions run high as both captain and crew begin to doubt each other. Josh and Jake Harris confront Captain Derrick Ray about the low numbers and how Derrick is running the boat. After getting a report on incoming weather and fearing dead loss, the ''Cornelia Marie'' anchors behind [[St. Matthew Island]] to wait on the storm. On board the ''Kodiak'', a broken hydraulic system in the deck crane forces the crew to push pots on deck. Deckhand Jake Jolibois injures his back after slipping on the deck. Jake refuses to come off deck until Captain Bill Wichrowski orders him off deck.

However, a power failure leaves the boat drifting uncontrollably towards the dock. While the rest of the crew ineffectively scrambles to drop the anchor, Edgar Hansen switches over to the auxiliary engine and restores power to the boat. On board the ''Wizard'', the low numbers of crab makes Captain Keith Colburn feel that there is \"bad juju\" on board the boat and he orders the crew to sweep the boat for anything out of the ordinary. The crew finds a broken guitar handle belonging to Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' that the crew had taken from him during an incident at a bar in town. The crew tosses the handle overboard, but the poor numbers continue. The next day, when Deck Boss Monte Colburn heads inside to take a break, he finds a seagull in the galley. Seagulls are thought to be the souls of lost seaman, so the crew takes it as a good sign that their luck as changed. Their luck does change as big numbers of crab finally come over the rail. When Deckhand Lynn Guitard takes wheel watch on the trip in to offload, he falls asleep at the wheel after turning off the watch alarm. The ''Seabrooke'' heads out to the blue king crab grounds. Low numbers of crab force the crew to step up the pace, which causes the greenhorn to struggle. He finally pulls himself off the deck when he can no longer deal with the cramps in his hands. On board the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson takes the poor results of his town soak string of pots personally. When Jake and Edgar Hansen have a fierce argument, Captain Sig Hansen counsels Jake on how to handle the situation. Still pulling low numbers, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' heads back to the \"slime banks\" to fish an area that he did not cover weeks earlier. While the crew is dubious since the \"slime banks\" had produced low numbers, the gamble pays off and the ''Time Bandit'' pulls up good numbers.\n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=87\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Exit Wounds\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|5|17}}\n |ShortSummary=Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' catches deckhand Lynn Guitard asleep during the wheel watch.

When the ''Wizard'' finally offloads after a 15-day trip, Captain Keith sees more dead loss that he would have liked. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan Hillstrand shuts down the deck after heavy seas knock deckhand Mike Fourtner off his feet. Captain Johnathan is worries that the crab bio mass might move while the deck is shut down, but the fears prove unfounded when good numbers are pulled in once the weather clears. On board the ''Kodiak'', Deck Boss Adam McCalden's constant belittling of the crew about working slowly forces Captain Bill Wichrowski to order him off deck. With deckhand Jack Jolibois still down with a back injury, the boat has to work with a three man deck. After offloading {{convert|16000|lb|kg}} of blue king crab, the Harris brothers tell Captain Derrick Ray that if the ''Cornelia Marie'' does not have good numbers with the town soak string that the boat needs to abandon blue king crab fishing and go red king crab fishing.

However, on the way, the crew decides that they can no longer work under Captain Derrick they decide to end their king crab season. The ''Seabrooke's'' big push before heading to offload is made harder when the greenhorn does not come back on deck after quitting.

When Captain Derrick confronts the crew about what he finds, the crew deny that it is theirs. On board the ''Northwestern'', the crab count picks up after Edgar Hansen apologizes to Jake Anderson, easing the tension between them that started after Jake's town soak string pulled up low numbers. The deck of the ''Kodiak'' is back to a five-man crew after deckhand Jake Jolibois says he is recovered enough to help on deck and Deck Boss Adam McCalden apologizes to Captain Wichrowski for his treatment of the rest of the crew. However, the five-man deck does not last for long as the short handed work has taken a toll on long time deckhand Eric Anderson's foot and he is ordered off deck.

Matt asks for his spot back for opilio season. After the crew finishes up the season, Edgar Hansen tells Captain Sig that he will not be returning for the opilio season in January. It is prank time on board the ''Time Bandit''. The first prank is an initiation for deckhand Justin Tennison as he is asked to return for opilio season.

As a storm moves into the Blue crab grounds, the ''Ramblin' Rose'' pulls the last of its string of pots set on Captain Scott's string. Frustrated with poor fishing, bad weather and the attitude of his crew, Captain Elliott heads out onto the deck to confront his crew about their attitude and the state of disarray on the deck.

The biggest storm of the season is battering the ''Ramblin' Rose'' as it continues to haul near empty pots on the Blue crab grounds. Captain Elliott Neese notices the starboard engine isn't going into gear and heads to the engine room. The problem is a snapped shifting cable that he is able to replace, but the morale of the crew is at an all-time low. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' has promised his granddaughter that he'll quit smoking on her birthday and at midnight he and deckhand Josh Harris both quit smoking. On the Blue crab grounds, the ''Seabrooke'' is in the middle of the storm with a full load of pots on the deck. The crew spends the next three hours setting 35 pots to lighten the load. The ''Northwestern'' has been on good fishing for three weeks but the numbers are falling. The deckboss, Edgar Hansen, notices the signs of a rat on board, catches it and drops it into a barrel. They decide to set it free the next time they dock. Captain Sig comments that Norway rats are good luck on a boat. The pots start coming up full again. In Dutch Harbour, the ''Wizard''s newest greenhorn, Chris Scambler, prepares for his first trip. Brady Quinn is the other ''Wizard'' greenhorn. On the ''Time Bandit'' it's been eight hours since Captain Johnathan Hillstrand has had a cigarette and the pressure is on. He has 24 hours before his scheduled off-load and he needs some luck to fill his tanks. Deckhand Josh Harris caves in and has a cigarette after some ribbing from the rest of the crew. As the ''Wizard'' arrives on the Red crab grounds, finding bad weather, greenhorn Chris Scambler questions his decision to take this job. On the ''Seabrooke'' the weather is bad but the fishing is good when an alarm sounds from the engine room. Captain Scott Campbell Jr. goes to investigate and discovers that the ''Seabrooke'' has blown one of her two main engines.

After being at sea only four days, ''Wizard'' greenhorn Chris Scambler is struggling as Captain Keith Colburn shuts down fishing due to the bad weather. The ''Seabrooke'' is in St. Paul for their second off-load of blue crab and it's enough to win the bet with Captain Elliott Neese. Captain Scott Campbell Jr. calls his father to see if he has been able to source any parts to fix the ''Seabrooke's'' crippled engine but none are available. The weather is worsening as Captain Scott decides to leave St. Paul before they shut the harbour down. It's a treacherous exit with the current pushing the ''Seabrooke'' toward the rocky shore. ''Ramblin' Rose'' Captain Elliott Neese receives a call from the ship's owners telling him if he doesn't start producing they will send another ship up to take his place. Because the fishing is so bad, Captain Elliott pushes his crew even harder to produce. The ''Wizard'' is fighting 25-foot seas and Captain Keith Colburn orders his greenhorns, Chris Scambler and Brady Quinn, to take shelter on deck for their own safety. After a pot breaks loose from the crane and crashes to the deck, Captain Keith orders everyone off deck. There are hurricane warnings on the Blue crab grounds as the ''Seabrook'' struggles to pull pots with one engine.

An Arctic hurricane is threatening to shut down fishing. It is the worst storm since 1977, and on the Blue crab grounds most of the fleet is anchored behind St. Matthew's Island but the ''Ramblin' Rose'' continues to fish. The weather and the fishing are both terrible and the crew is feeling the brunt of the storm. Finally a call comes in from the boat's owner and Captain Elliott Neese is ordered to join the rest of the fleet behind St. Matthew's Island. The crew is relieved but Captain Elliott is livid.

The ''Wizard'' gets back relief captain Monte Colburn along with new greenhorn Roger Schlosstein, but Monte and engineer Lenny Lekanoff are still dealing with injuries. Fortunately, Captain Keith Colburn's luck is better than that of the rest of the fleet, as full pots come over the side on the first string. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', half the crew is new after a trying king crab season, and deck boss Kevin \"Kado\" Davis defects to the ''Seabrooke'' after being cut loose by Captain Elliott Neese for attitude problems. Captain Elliott's job in the wheelhouse is on the line, but his mind is with his children and ex-girlfriend, who he broke up with in the offseason and isn't returning his calls. The ''Seabrooke'' is forced to turn back to Dutch Harbour after Captain Scott Campbell, Jr. discovers the port engine is running hot, threatening to delay the start of their season for weeks. The ''Time Bandit's'' luck is worst of all - in rapid succession, deckhand Travis Lofland falls overboard at the dock in Dutch, the coiler is damaged beyond use after the crew foolishly decides to use mortars to de-ice the boat (forcing the crew to coil by hand for the trip), and the first string set by Captain Andy Hillstrand comes up with blanks.

However, junior deckhand Lynn Guitard's repeated failures (first at throwing the hook, then at properly tying down the stack) slow the boat's progress and get under Captain Keith's skin; with greenhorn Roger Schlosstein impressing the crew with his effort and earning a 0.5% raise, it appears Lynn's days on the ''Wizard'' may be numbered. Meanwhile, Captain Sig Hansen keeps the ''Northwestern'' on crowded grounds and is rewarded when full pots come over the rail. Deck boss Edgar Hansen, dealing with a significant amount of pain, finally asks an elated Captain Sig to drive the boat during hauling; deckhand Jake Anderson will get to run the deck when Edgar is in the wheelhouse. The ''Time Bandit'' is also on the crab, keeping morale high in the face of having to coil all the pots by hand. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand decides to join the crew on deck to help with the coiling, but his time there is short-lived when he aggravates an old back injury.

You know what's different? It's called 'entitlement'.\" Switching to footage of four offspring of Alaska crabbers: ''Saga'' - Captain Elliott Neese says \"This job is for the elite. The rest of these guys can go to pasture.\" ''Northwestern'' - 18-year-old Mandy Hansen, daughter of Captain Sig and niece of Edgar and Norman says \"I'm doing it. At some point I have to. It's in my blood.\" ''Cornelia Marie'' - Captain Josh Harris says \"I'm just doing what I know to do, instead of what other people tell me I ''should'' be doing.\" ''Seabrooke'' - Captain Scott Campbell Jr. says \"If you can't tow your weight, it's time for you to go.\" Over footage of the Hillstrands on the ''Time Bandit'' and ''Wizard'' and ''Northwestern'' decks, Keith says, \"You want to be top dog?\", before switching to him sitting in the ''Wizard'' wheelhouse saying \"Be careful what you wish for.\" More season preview footage before the opening credits roll.\n\nAs October rolls around, 2013 King Crab season boat preparations go off without a hitch, except for something no one foresaw: a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|Federal government shutdown]] which closed the office that issues permits/quotas for the fishery. Jake Anderson returns to the ''Northwestern'' after being mistreated on the ''Kiska Sea'' (during 2013 Opilio season).\n\nThe Hillstrands and Hansens conspire on an epic double-double-cross prank involving deckhand Nick \"Sunshine\" Tokeman, who left the ''Northwestern'' upon Jake's return to fill the gap in the ''Time Bandit'' crew created by Josh Harris' return to the ''Cornelia Marie'' as her Captain.\n\nCaptain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski on the ''Cape Caution'' takes on an ex-Marine greenhorn with Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishing experience. Junior aggravates his back injury changing a deck light bulb on the ''Seabrooke''.\n\nA capless and bald Captain Keith is in [[Washington, D.C.]] to testify before the Senate Commerce committee while Monte preps the ''Wizard'', with, miraculously, no new greenhorns to break in. The fleet's Captains and some deckhands watch the [[C-SPAN|C-SPAN 3]] broadcast testimony in the local bar.\n\nAfter 3 years of fishing blue king crab, Captain Elliott preps for his first season on the red king crab grounds. As the shutdown continues, Junior and Keith patch up differences at the local bar. \"Sunshine\" is caught in a net as the \"Operation Moonbeam\" prank is executed.\n\nThe shutdown ends, and the fleet scrambles to get quotas, fuel, and hit the sea. In many ways, the season will have the feel of the old derby system, to get to the crab first, catch as many as you can, and deliver them in time for the early November holiday season deadlines.\n\nThe ''Cape Caution'' suddenly loses its starter when \"Wild\" Bill doesn't engage in the voodoo protection ritual brought on deck by the new greenhorn, and is the last to get out of Dutch Harbor. Bill completes the ritual and the quarter is tossed off-deck.\n\nThe first hour wraps up as the ''Time Bandit'', while setting pots, is boarded by a small boat crew from [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] cutter ''[[USCGC Waesche (WMSL-751)|Waesche]]'' for a spot safety gear inspection, despite a complete boat inspection prior to departure.\n\nHour 2 starts with ''Seabrooke'' finishing their initial string set. Junior's back injury hurts so much, he pulls the unusual for him [[modus operandi|M.O.]] of soaking his pots without spot checks\n\n''Wizard'' pulls their first pots after Keith engages in deckhand Freddy's cod blood ritual for good luck.\n\n''Northwestern'' pulls their first pots. Marine radio notifies the fleet than an automated EPIRB distress beacon has been received 60 nautical miles west of [[Adak Island|Adak]], registered to the fishing vessel ''Western Venture''. Sig says \"I'm pretty sure I know him. He's a little guy, he's only 59-foot. Not good!\" USCG dispatches helicopter 6005 and a C-130 for search-and-rescue operations. The C-130 arrives first, and verifies the boat is on fire, as well as verifying that the five-man crew is on board the life raft floating near-by. The rescue copter is a half-hour out, but the \"good Samaritan\" crab-fishing vessel ''Aleutian Beauty'' is closer, and they rescue the crew from the life raft.\n\nJunior is in so much pain, he has his relief captain Brad Petefish begin pulling pots. Brad lets Junior know they're seeing crab, and he returns mid-string, much better but still in pain.\n\n''Cape Caution'' finally arrives on the grounds and sets pots. On the ''Saga'', Elliott's first red king crab prospect string is a winner, and he sets the remainder of his pots there.\n\nThe weather radio broadcast forecasts 50-knot winds and 30-foot seas, further complicating the already short season. As the fleet powers through the storm, on the ''Cape Caution'', the greenhorn is falling behind and \"Wild\" Bill diagnoses he hasn't been eating enough. \n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=131\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Family Affair\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The episode opens with a voice-over by ''Cape Caution'' Captain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski and footage across the fleet from the episode: \"It's the old question: 'What does it take to make it on the Bering Sea?' On paper, a guy can look great: ex-Marine, commercial fisherman, sport fisherman\" (referring to his latest greenhorn's qualifications). The introduction concludes by switching to Bill in his Captain's chair saying \"You gotta be nuts to do this job.\"\n\nThe fleet is way behind schedule thanks to the government shutdown, as noted by the comments of the Captains, and a storm bearing down on the fleet makes that problem worse.\n\n''Cape Caution'''s lone greenhorn is still not 100%, but is needed to help with gear, and carelessly tosses a pot buoy into a crew member.\n\n''Seabrooke'' is pounded by waves as Junior wrestles with severe back pain, but the set-back string has great numbers, and sets back a third time.\n\n55-knot winds haven't done much to stop the ''Saga'', with 30,000 lbs in the tanks and a 38 crab-per-pot average, and the set-back string continues Captain Elliott's first red king season success until the numbers of keepers drops to singles.\n\nOn the ''Northwestern'', they have 100,000 lbs on board and look to top off the tanks. Before they haul the pots, Edgar must fix a sudden electrical problem with the mast-mounted lights. Edgar remounts two of the lights on the deck in the interim. As they haul pots, Captain Sig hears communications between a [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] rescue helicopter and the ''Blue Gadus'': \"I'm not sure who that is; I think that's a long-liner.\" 148 miles southwest, a ''Blue Gadus'' crewman has suffered a [[pulmonary embolism]] and requires medevac. which will be extremely difficult in the storm due to 30-foot seas and 100-knot winds. It takes two attempts to land the rescue basket on deck, but they complete the rescue. Sig comments how lucky the rescued guy is, that the copter rescued him before the worst of the storm caused them to abort the rescue.\n\nOn the ''Seabrooke'', Junior is looking to top off the tanks and go home. The third time through the string has very low numbers, and the weather radio broadcast forecasts 40-knot winds with 14-18-foot seas. Switching to later that night on the ''Time Bandit'', the forecast is for east 50-knot winds and 24-foot seas with fog and rain.\n\nOn the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith knows he's in for \"three-four days of bad weather, some of that hellaciously bad\", as he's already experiencing sustained 65-mph winds gusting to 80 and 90. As the brunt of the storm hits, the Captains are left to decide how much pain to endure before calling crews off the rails.\n\nOn the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan gives his son/deck boss Scott a pep talk before hauling pots. After a 29-hour soak, their pots come up with great numbers, but 25-foot swells are causing Axel (son of engineer Neal and nephew of Captains Johnathan and Andy) to have problems controlling the 800-lb pots. Scott and Axel have a cousin shouting match after a wave knocks Axel off balance and almost crushes him against the sorting table. Johnathan shuts down fishing before anyone gets hurt.\n\nWeather radio forecasts east 45 to southwest 50-knot winds, and Sig, Junior and Elliott also decide to shut down fishing until the worst passes. Only the ''Cape Caution'' is still fishing, and the new location of low numbers is not good, however the greenhorn is finally in the groove and the crew is working together as bigger numbers (and a big crab) arrive.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=132\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Darwin's Law\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|5|6}}\n |ShortSummary=A storm shut down the fleet, now an even more severe weather system hits them again.

While the ''Saga'' comes as close as they dare, the crew gets a scare when the underside of the hull smacks the bottom when it goes down with the waves, and back off a bit. With the ''Arctic Hunter'''s crew in their life raft, Mike and another deckhand swim out to the life raft and on the second try, successfully get a rope secured to it. The ''Saga'' tows them out of danger and gets the stranded crew aboard.\n\nOn the ''Cape Caution'', Bill's greenhorn Kelly is looking for a way off the boat by revealing that he has a pending arrest warrant hanging over him (for constructing an illegal firearm), and must return to shore for trial. Bill is not convinced by his story, and decides to call Kelly's bluff by contacting the authorities himself - who tell him that Kelly can finish his contractual obligations first. When offloading in Dutch, Bill delivers the bad news to Kelly, that he must return to sea to finish the season. On the ''Seabrooke'', Junior's back is troubling him and his crew convince him to head for shore.

Josh stops the truck and gets out about half-way through what the aeral pull back reveals to be the crab pot stacks, and as the pull back finishes we see the entire port side of the CM at dock before the opening credits. (The episode title is taken from Josh's line about \"betting it all on blue, ''Cornelia Marie'' blue\" from late in season 9).\n\nAs footage of all the usual suspects preparing their boats for 2014 Opilio season rolls, Mike Rowe's voice over: \"on the line: $32 million in Bering Sea bounty\". This time, however, there are several twists.\n\nTwist 1: We see more footage of Josh driving to the dock, reflecting on his father, as he has finally bought controlling interest in the family business, and the next aerial shot comes up over a pot stack to see the starboard side of the CM, tower lights blazing. As Josh walks on deck, we switch to the wheelhouse to meet long-time Harris family friend, co-captain/engineer Casey McManus. Prepping crab pots not used since 2011 is a significant challenge, as is having the youngest crew in the fleet, including Josh's high school classmate (and ''[[Bering Sea Gold]]'' digger) Cody Moen. Before they set sail, ''Time Bandit'' Captains Andy and Johnathan present Josh with a black [[hoodie]] saying \"I'm the S. H. I. T.\" on front, and \"S.kipper H.arris I.n T.raining\" on back.\n\nTwist 2: Elliott returns from rehab, and receives a surprise visit and encouragement from fellow recovering addict Edgar Hansen as ''Saga'' preps for Opilio season, with one of the rescued ''Arctic Hunter'' deckhands replacing Elliott's dad on deck.\n\nTwist 3: 18-year-old Mandy Hansen spends her winter high school break with her father (Sig), and tries to convince him to take her crab fishing on the ''Northwestern'' (including footage from last summer's salmon tendering from the \"Legend of the ''Northwestern''\" special); Sig has her do emergency drills and prep pots with the other deckhands before sending her home to get her mother's permission to go crabbing.\n\nTwist 4: ''Seabrooke'' is still in port as Junior recovers from spinal fusion surgery in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]].\n\nTwist 5: ''Time Bandit'' leaves port without Johnathan in the second seat, who is taking advice from the doctor to lower his blood pressure.\n\nTwist 6: ''Cape Caution'''s latest new greenhorn was hired by... Zack! Wild Bill always seems to pick bad ones, especially the last one from king season, so this time he let his son choose one.\n\nMandy and Johnathan return to Seattle as the fleet heads out to sea and begins setting pots.\n\nCasey watches as Josh sets his first prospect string on the ''Cornelia Marie'', and refutes Derrick Ray's comment from 3 years ago about Phil doing them a disservice by not teaching them how to run the boat, because they were not ready to learn how then.\n\nAs they are setting pots, ''Northwestern'' loses the starboard rudder control due to a cracked solenoid. Edgar gives Sig part information, and Sig calls around the fleet for possible replacements. The closest potential spare, much to Jake's dismay, is on the ''Kiska Sea'', and the ships pull close to transfer the part. Edgar discovers the part is incompatible. Until a fix is done, Jake Anderson will steer using the old manual ship's wheel while Sig runs the throttle. Edgar, calling on years of [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]-ing experience, resorts to his grinder and some industrial-grade epoxy to repair the solenoid, restoring full rudder control for the moment as they resume setting pots.\n\nOn the ''Cornelia Marie'', Josh takes the \"in training\" part seriously, while clips of Derrick and Phil play, as he decides to watch how Casey pulls pots in 45-50-knot winds and 20-foot seas before risking his crew when he does it.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=137\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Skipper Harris in Training\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|6|17}}\n |ShortSummary=The introduction previews Captain Keith's gamble on the icy northern edge of the fishing grounds near the [[Russia]]n border, with Russian transmissions on the marine sideband radio.\n\nPicking up where the previous episode left off, ''Cornelia Marie'' pulls its first Opilio pots since 2011, and the entire prospect string for Captains Josh and Casey comes up blanks, a first for any Josh-set string. Josh gives the crew a pep talk before they head off for hopefully better fishing.\n\nOn the ''Cape Caution'', they pull their first pots and the numbers are good, and Captain Wild Bill is counting on Zack and Nick to keep the new greenhorn working.\n\nCaptain Keith braves the northern edge of the fishing grounds with the ''Wizard'', and a storm has prevented the crew from performing normal ice control measures. 12 hours from his desired grounds, the helm's sluggish response prompts Keith to get the crew out to knock out 50,000-80,000 pounds of 4-foot-thick ice and drop pots early to reduce the weight on deck, with Keith vowing \"this will never happen again on my watch\".\n\nBack on the ''Cape Caution'', Bill sets back pots on good numbers until a pot being pulled up hits off the side of the boat and smacks the new greenhorn square on the nose, breaking it. [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] Zack controls the bleeding, but the injury requires stitches, and Bill is uncomfortable stitching somebody's face. Bill suggests steri-stripping with gauze over the top and Zack applies the strips to immobilize the nose.\n\nOn the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig hits a hot string in bad seas, and the crew takes a chow break between strings. Matt informs Sig that the electrical breaker panel is \"hot, hot\" to the touch. Sig calls Edgar in to find the problem. With all the new electronics and hydraulics added in recent years, boat electrical systems like ''Northwestern'''s are past their design limits. Once again, Jake will have to use the manual ship's wheel to steer while Edgar works on the panel. Edgar trims the crusty part of a panel wire to reveal good wire, reattaches it to the panel, and successfully powers up the wheelhouse. Their next string is continuing good numbers when Sig gets a call from his wife, informing him she actually has given their daughter Mandy her permission to go crab fishing. Sig never expected his wife would ever do that. \"Me and my big mouth, huh?\"\n\nBack on the ''Wizard'', they pull pots, and Keith's gamble pays off big time as pot after pot fills up the tank with keepers. \"That was the longest five days of my fishing career.

The ''Time Bandit'' is pulling big numbers, but things come to an abrupt end when the vessel throws a propeller, forcing a return to port for repairs. The ''Wizard'' is too far north to get back in time, but Captain Keith pipes the radio commentary onto the deck whilst his crew work on. Despite poor fishing, Casey and Josh decide to take the ''Cornelia Marie'' back to port in treacherous waters to make the game - Josh says he will \"swim if he has to\". Celebrations are all over St Paul when the Seahawks win, but Captain Andy and Scott Hillstrand have a massive fall-out when Scott suggests his uncle should abandon the rest of the Opilio season and give the ''Time Bandit'''s quota to him for use on another boat. \n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=142\n |EpisodeNumber2=14\n |Title=Breaking Mandy\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|22}}\n |ShortSummary= Junior returns to Dutch after his long absence to try and salvage the ''Seabrooke'''s Opilio season, against his doctor's advice that his back injury hasn't healed.

Meanwhile on the ''Northwestern'', Sig and Edgar decide that it's time to expose Mandy to the real rigors of crab fishing after a spell of unusually benign weather on the Bering Sea, and concerns among the crew that Mandy is getting preferential treatment. Sig orders a 30-hour grind to test where Mandy's breaking point will be. On the ''Saga'', Elliot's patience with his crew is tested, when they rebel against his orders to use containers to manually transport the crab to the rear tanks, and end up breaking the crab table in protest. Back on the ''Northwestern'', the crew battle to finish the first trip, and to return Mandy to Dutch Harbor for her flight home to Seattle.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=143\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Sabotage\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|29}}\n |ShortSummary= The ''Time Bandit'' is in dry dock during Opilio season for the third time in as many years for a replacement propeller after the vessel broke its propeller shaft. Captain Andy has run out of time owing to commitments back onshore, and calls on brother Jonathan to finish Opilio season for him once the boat is repaired. After the ''Northwestern'' finishes its first trip with Mandy Hansen as greenhorn, Sig drives her to the airport for her flight home to Seattle, but he fails to convince her that there are easier ways to make a living than crab fishing. Meanwhile on the ''Cape Caution'', Captain \"Wild\" Bill is on the verge of finishing his season, but at the eleventh hour is given more quota by the boat's owners. He makes the decision to extend the trip to increase the potential haul, but the greenhorn decides to deliberately waste the boat's scant supply of bait in an attempt cut the season short, but Bill quickly realizes what is going on and confronts him over the issue. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is still pulling large numbers in the far north of the fishing grounds, but his run of good luck is finally broken when a pot snares on the vessel's propeller, badly damaging it - but it remains serviceable. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is also getting close to finishing the season, but Captain Casey has to confront his crew over insubordination. After a pep talk from Casey and with Josh Harris returning to the deck to boost morale, the vessel finishes its first Opilio season with Josh as owner, meeting its first quota handsomely. Whilst the crew are doing their unload, another fisherman presents Josh with a stray pot buoy that has washed up on shore - it turns out that it is from the same crab pot that the crew of the ''Wizard'' deliberately sunk three years ago in memorial to his late father Phil. Captain Keith reckons that it is a message from Phil to Josh to keep pressing on with his ambition to eventually captain the ''Corneila Marie''.\n\nThe other captains comment on Josh's first season, saying that he would have made Phil proud, but also that he still has a lot of learning to do before he can become a skipper himself.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=144\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=You'll Know My Name Is The Lord...\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|8|5}}\n |ShortSummary=(2-hour Season Finale)\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 11 (2015) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=7% | No. in<br />season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=20% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=145\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=A Brotherhood Tested\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|4|14}}\n |ShortSummary=A 12-million pound Bairdi quota increase causes a fishing frenzy; a boat is stolen on the eve of a launch; an alliance takes root.\n |LineColor=A4273E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=146\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Prodigal Son\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|4|21}}\n |ShortSummary=An additional 15 million dollars in crab sends the fleet into a fishing frenzy.

Discussion topics: \"Old vs. Young\" (old guys staying in the game vs. new guys like Elliott and Junior); \"Sibling Rivalries\" among the Hansen, Hillstrand and Colburn brothers about sharing the helm (with guest Captain/deck boss Edgar); \"Where We Left Off\" (recapping Season 8's slashed quotas and early descending ice pack); \"The Off Season\" (what the Captains did for fun or work between seasons, including the ''Time Bandit'' engine and hull upgrades); \"Wild Bill\" the weatherman for ''The Bait'', and also fired by the ''Kodiak'''s owners after Season 8 for losing crab pots due to the early descending ice pack; \"The Josh Harris Situation\": Johnathan and Andy interview Josh about the situation with him, his brother Jake, and three years of frustration trying to purchase the ''Cornelia Marie'' (with flashbacks from ''After the Catch IV'' and ''After the Catch VI'').\n\nRegular feature \"The Hot Seat\" debuts with Sig interviewing Elliott the dad; Keith interviewing Elliott the Captain (with guest appearance by Executive Producer Jeff Conroy showing time-coded tape of events that led to Elliott being fired from the ''Ramblin' Rose'') and previewing Elliott's new purchase, the ''Saga'' (last seen in Season 1); and Andy interviewing Junior about his \"legend-ary\" Season 8 and previews of Season 9 troubles he'll have with Keith.\n\n\"Boat Tour\": Johnathan is pranked by Keith and Monte after touring the ''Wizard''; Wild Bill shows Edgar his new ride, the ''Cape Caution'', which required a lot of repairs by the owners to put it in service again on short notice. Celebrity questions from actor [[Steve Carell]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Midseason Kings\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|5|14}}\n |ShortSummary=Mike Rowe's introduction to the episode, over fist fights and a flaming hook, sums up the first half of 2012 King Crab season perfectly: \"The fiery battles continue throughout the Bering Sea: for turf, for survival, and for the ''Deadliest Catch''. So before tonight's new episode, the Captains are set to hash it out and crank you up.\"\n\nContinuing on last week's old vs. young theme, they talk about how captains typically took five years or longer (and presumed past age 30) to go from working a deck to the wheelhouse, and many young guys, like Josh Harris and Jake Anderson are trying to get there before age 30, as well as Edgar wanting a crack at captaining ''Northwestern'' for Blue King Crab season. And as highlights from the episode air, Edgar reminds viewers that the \"SH\" letters on the vessel's shield \"do not stand for Sig Hansen\" (they stand for Sverre Hansen, their father); Wild Bill trying to educate his son Zack in a hurry on how to fish crab; Junior and Elliott trying to catch blues.\n\nFirst up, \"The Saga Saga\": The Captains interview Elliott, and Sig reveals he didn't even know the boat was still functional, followed by Elliott giving Edgar the \"Boat Tour\". Back in studio, they talk about how ''Saga'' hasn't fished in eight years, and Elliott also mentions the Season 1 man overboard of Kevin \"Kado\" Davis (later one of Elliott's ''Ramblin' Rose'' deckhands) when he was working on the ''Saga''. \"Alliances\": Sig, Johnathan, Keith and Elliott confront Junior about how he does alliances.\n\n\"Edgar vs. Sig\": Using footage from the \"Revelations\" special and \"Mutiny on the Bering Sea\", we see why Edgar has had an uphill fight with Sig to learn the wheelhouse side of the family business, as Keith sits inbetween the brothers for the interview. \"Boat Tour\": Sig gives Zack a tour of the ''Northwestern''.\n\n\"The ''Cape Caution''\": The Captains interview Wild Bill, commending his ability to pull his new ship out of mothballs and have it catching crab in a very short time, and reviewing adventures of the father/son deck hand duo of Kirby and Mikey Mitchell.\n\nCelebrity questions from [[NASCAR]] racer [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], answered by Wild Bill in person at the race track. Johnathan, captain/children's book author, reads to kids at the Unalaska library.\n\n\"The Hot Seat\": Sig interviews Josh Harris and Johnathan about Jake Harris' problems, and Josh's efforts to procure the ''Cornelia Marie'', and Josh announces he is going to be a father; Sig interviews Andy, who is keeping a close eye on his brother's health, in the wake of Johnathan breaking his ribs TWICE inbetween 2012 Opilio and King Crab seasons, the first was bull riding caught on tape for ''After the Catch VI'' and the second in a motorcycle accident while the boat was being repaired (as seen in the \"Legend of the Time Bandit\" special).\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Opilio Kicks Off\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|4}}\n |ShortSummary=Before the Captains kick off a 2013 Opilio season that may prove to be just as icy and nasty as 2012 Opilio season was, they have to tie up the loose ends from 2012 King Crab season.\n\nFirst up, \"Captain Edgar's Blue Crab\": Despite Sig's reservations, he let Edgar take the helm for blues. Edgar fixed a failed part, caught their quota AND defused a reprise of the Season 4 fight between deck hands Jake Anderson and Matt Bradley; Matt joins Sig, Edgar and Keith to discuss the aftermath. Jake left after kings to pursue an opportunity to captain the ''Kiska Sea''.\n\nJohnathan and Andy give a quick \"Opilio Geography\" lesson on where the fishing grounds are. Mike Rowe and ''Time Bandit'' deckhand Mike Fourtner describe \"Dutch Harbor Bunker Hill\", from its [[World War II]] days as an Army base with Fourtner giving the physical tour. The Captains sing \"Bill's Blues\" with Wild Bill, going too far north and low numbers on blues until late in the season.\n\nThe Captains put Elliott in \"The Hot Seat\" to talk about his first season as a boat owner, and what it will take to start turning profits; then they add Junior to the discussion as they square off over their blue \"alliance\"; then they talk about being sons of crab fisherman, and Scott Sr.'s near-fatal accident that cut short Junior's king season. Also in \"The Hot Seat\" (again) is Josh Harris, still working on the ''Time Bandit'' as he works to procure the ''Cornelia Marie'', and will be given the graduation boot by the Hillstrands at the end of the season.\n\nCelebrity studio visit and question by [[Meat Loaf]]. Keith and Lenny show us \"Dutch Harbor's Deadliest Church\", the iconic 1825 [[Russian Orthodox]] church shown in the ''Deadliest Catch'' opening credits and Keith rings the bells installed in 1894. As ''Wizard'' prepares to sail with yet another greenhorn deckhand, the Captains discuss Keith's reputation as \"The Greenhorn Slayer\", with Executive Producer Jeff Conroy adding \"cameraman slayer\" to Keith's reputation over footage he had reviewed on the day this episode was taped.\n\nThe first ever \"''The Bait'' Exclusive\" (footage not aired on ''Deadliest Catch'' or ''On Deck'') shows ''Wizard'' being pummeled by a massive [[rogue wave]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Fouled By Weather\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|25}}\n |ShortSummary=Opening with scenes depicting Opilio fishing described in Mike Rowe's introduction as \"fouled by weather\", the Captains and crews are having some anger management issues over another very bad Opilio weather season, especially Zack and crew on the ''Cape Caution'', a deckhand fight on the ''Wizard'' and Captain Andy and the ''Time Bandit'' crew of veteran deckhands.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\", the ''Time Bandit'' crew, represented first by Josh Harris then by deck boss Mike Fourtner discussing the lack of bait (Axel's job) and Andy missing a double-rogue wave call that endangered the crew and sent a pot overboard. What likely saved the crew was their \"sea wall\", a high section of railing that crew can duck behind, as Junior demonstrates on ''Seabrooke'' where his rails were before the season, and where they are now after installing the sea walls.\n\nWild Bill delivers a typical rainy Seattle weather report, with Edgar providing the garden hose rainfall. Back in studio, the Captains and Wild Bill discuss lousy fishing, Mikey having a new girlfriend back in Oregon, and Zack berating the old man for the bad numbers. During a break in taping, Johnathan and Andy try to poach Zack from Wild Bill until Bill sees what's going on.\n\nCelebrity questions from [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Chad Smith]]. Their musical and community appreciation is shown with footage from \"The Captains' Concert\" at the [[SXSW]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. When asked by a local reporter what kind of music they listen to on deck, Sig and Johnathan tell him no music, because they need to be able to communicate, which leads into a discussion back in studio about \"Distractions at Sea\", led by Elliott's boom box drowning out a rogue wave much like the one Andy missed.\n\nNext up in \"The Hot Seat\": Elliott, discussing his personal problems and their effect on the ''Saga'' crew. Junior provides an update on his father being past the critical stage and recovering, and facing a two-week delay in the start of his Opilio season heading into a descending ice pack driving the rest of the fleet south as he heads north.\n\nNext in \"The Hot Seat\": Jake Anderson makes his debut on ''The Bait'', facing Sig and Edgar again, and also discussing the Seattle/Oregon rivalry when the ''Kiska Sea'' crew resents a Seattle kid potentially running the boat. \"Sunshine\", Jake's replacement on ''Northwestern'' also appears.\n\nSpecial guest C. J. Cutter from ''[[Blood and Oil]]'' visits the set and previews an episode of that Discovery series. Lenny and the Captains discuss Freddy's fight with the ''Wizard'''s greenhorn.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title=Iced Over\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|16}}\n |ShortSummary=The episode opens with the Captains talking about the previous week's ''Deadliest Catch'' episode, where boats came in to port at St. Paul Island to offload crab after battling the fast-descending ice pack and mechanical problems; and previews of that night's episode returning to see who lost gear, who caught crab, Wild Bill fixing a mechanical problem at sea, and ''Wizard'' hit by a rogue wave. They also discuss how the ice problems throw off delivery schedules and potential loss of crab, pots and money if the gear goes off the edge into deeper water without enough line to the buoys.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\": Keith, since at this point in 2013 Opilio season, he's the only one \"on the crab\" and he's in a race to pull his gear before the ice claims any pots. Then the other Captains add fuel to the fire by bringing in ''Wizard'''s oldest deckhand, Lenny, and Edgar to discuss insubordination, and how older crew like Lenny can give a \"smooth f--- off\" to Monte and get away with it because of his tenure, when greenhorns like Dane cannot. As they discuss how one greenhorn being confined to quarters can flip control of a deck, Keith asks \"Can I get out of this seat sometime soon?\" as they show the rogue wave compounding Keith's problems.\n\nJohnathan tries his hand at captaining a Seattle police boat on [[Lake Washington]].\n\nNext up in \"The Hot Seat\": Elliott joins the Captains as they discuss how insubordinate ''Saga'''s crew is towards him; followed by Junior, who is making up for lost time by fishing in dangerous conditions, turning a planned quick 48-hour trip into a 12-day adventure.\n\nCelebrity questions from actor [[Tom Green]].\n\nWild Bill is next to sit in \"The Hot Seat\", talking about his challenges teaching son Zack the ropes of fishing, including insubordination; Zack joins the discussion. Then they discuss the early departure of engineer Kirby Mitchell while Bill was repairing hydraulic lines on the ''Cape Caution''.\n\nWild Bill and Zack do some indoor skydiving on a break, experiencing 120-knot winds without the seaborne elements like salt or jellyfish.\n\nA new special feature, \"Fourtner Finds Out\" debuts, as ''Time Bandit'' deck boss Mike Fourtner finds out how hydraulics on a crab boat work, in response to Tom Green's second question. (The facility where the demo is performed serviced the cranes on both ''Time Bandit'' and ''Northwestern''.) Footage from ''Time Bandit'''s hydraulic pump failure from the previous week's episode is shown.\n\nAll three Hansen brothers revisit their auto shop teacher at Shorewood High School, recounting how lessons learned in shop class saved their lives at sea.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |Title=Hail Mary\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|23}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains start by discussing strategies for dealing with unexpected events, in a season where all the worst elements came together: injuries, breakdowns, bad fishing, bad waves, and bad ice.\n\nWhile talking about bad waves, \"Fourtner Finds Out\" exactly what a rogue wave is at the [[NOAA]] Western Regional Center in Seattle.\n\n\"Battling the Ice\": Junior and the Captains discuss how the ice was a game-changer in how they fished, and that the best ice strategy is to stay out of it; and how the top layer \"suitcases\" of pots with the buoys and lines still tied inside can be shed at a loss, if necessary, to save a boat.\n\n\"Seattle\": Keith shows how boats beat up by the ice get repaired and reprovisioned in Seattle at much lower costs than up in Alaska.\n\nWild Bill delivers a sunny weather report, while talking about how two \"kids\" in Elliott and Jake Anderson are trying to run crab boats, and will learn \"being a boat captain, it ain't kid stuff\".\n\nFirst in \"The Hot Seat\" is Jake Anderson, discussing how he left ''Northwestern'' only for an opportunity to captain a boat, not likely to happen soon there with Edgar and Norm Hansen already in line, and getting more information than helm time on the ''Kiska Sea''.\n\nNext in \"The Hot Seat\" is Elliott, discussing why he let his bad-mouthing engineer go, with Keith commenting how it takes time for a young captain to build a good crew, and how he still has problems with new greenhorns; then they discuss a really unusual unexpected problem: sand fleas that eat bait and crab, and using squid in their bait to eliminate the problem.\n\nJunior joins Sig, Andy and Keith to discuss how \"Junior's Hot Fishing\" spot came from the Colonel (Scott Sr.) and adopting his fishing techniques, as well.\n\nCelebrity questions from New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]].\n\nWild Bill and Zack join the Captains to discuss how Bill had to repair the crane on a boat that hadn't fished in a while, and how that helped the relationship with Zack.\n\nSig answers a fan question about girls on the boat, and we see the first pictures of his daughter Mandy on deck during summer tendering, with Johnathan telling Sig he'd love to see her fishing king crab, and Andy saying \"Women are not built for that job.\" for winter opilio fishing. Footage of Mandy and Matt Bradley on deck during tendering is shown as Johnathan explains what tendering is.\n\nAfter Sig answers a third question from Andrew Cuomo regarding having challenging younger brothers in the family business, Edgar joins Sig and Andy to discuss being \"Back on Deck\" after a successful Blue Crab season in the wheelhouse, and previews a short-of-quota Sig offering Edgar a chance to run the boat for an Opilio trip.\n\nJohnathan demonstrates how heavy those 800-lb crab pots are by squashing a squash and a melon with one.\n\nIn \"Crabbers Gone Wild\", we see how the end of the season drives the crews crazy. Wild Bill joins the discussion, and Keith previews the craziest thing he's even seen as Freddy jumps overboard to help harness a walrus carcass.\n\n[[Mike Rowe]] makes his first on-camera appearance on ''The Bait'' at the end of the episode when Johnathan says \"Who needs Mike Rowe?\", as the Captains' timing for the start of that night's ''Deadliest Catch'' episode is off by a few seconds.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=7\n |Title=The Home Stretch\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|30}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains begin the episode by entering the home stretch: previews of the 2-hour Season 9 finale, which continue the theme of the season, old vs. young.\n\nIn \"Boat by Boat\" segments, we get a look at the future of each boat. First up, ''Time Bandit'' and the departure of two seasoned deckhands.\n\nLanding first in \"The Hot Seat\" is Josh Harris, who announces to a toast of Coors (instead of \"duck farts\") that he has purchased the ''Cornelia Marie''. Josh plans on having a co-captain for at least one season, maybe two, after seeing what ''Time Bandit'' endured during Season 9, and Freddy on deck (Freddy promised to return if Josh ever ran the boat). Joining him is ''Time Bandit'' deck boss Mike Fourtner, retiring after 15 seasons due to expecting twins with his wife.\n\nKeith gives a shout out to the men and women who protect their livelihood: the [[United States Coast Guard]].\n\nWild Bill catches a fish in [[Pike Place Market]] because the previous week, he was chewed out for not being able to catch crab, which Sig also had problems with last week.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' \"Boat by Boat\" update starts with Sig offering Edgar the boat for the end of Opilio season, and continues with Sig finally sitting in \"The Hot Seat\", questioned by Wild Bill, Johnathan, Edgar, Andy and Keith, discussing the drama from the start of the season over blue quota, and Sig trying to apologize for underestimating Edgar's abilities. They also discuss Jake Anderson's decision to leave, and Sig interviews Jake at Sig's house.\n\n\"Boat by Boat\": Elliott is taking care of ''Saga'' business in [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], so is not able to defend himself for appearing \"disrespectful\" to older captains for doubting his ability to catch crab; and on ''Seabrooke'', Junior's alliances and bad news from home caused much grief. With Andy and Sig looking on, Junior confronts Keith about his perceived wrong to him, and walks off the set before violence erupts.\n\nAfter a break, Johnathan and Wild Bill return on set as \"Boat by Boat\" views the ''Wizard'''s crazy season, topped off by the crazy interview that just finished.\n\nCelebrity questions from none other than narrator [[Mike Rowe]].\n\n\"Boat by Boat\" updates wrap up with ''Cape Caution'''s bad fishing, breakdowns, and family drama.\n\nConcluding the \"old vs. young\" theme, Jake says to Sig that the younger ones, especially the sons of fishermen like Josh Harris and Scotty Hillstrand aren't pushing the bar, they're trying to keep up with the progress their fathers made at those points in life.\n\nEdgar, Mike Fourtner, Junior and Josh join the Captains on camera to wrap up the season, Edgar and Mike bringing in a TV to watch the season finale.\n}}\n|}\n\n==== ''The Bait'' 2 ====\n\nThe catch phrase for ''The Bait'' 2 is \"You can't catch crab without ''The Bait''.\"\n\nEpisode 6 filmed at Harlem Yacht Club in [[City Island, New York]]; Episodes 7-10 filmed at [[Mercer Island]] VFW near [[Seattle]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| # !!

As they preview an injury to the ''Cape Caution'''s greenhorn, \"The Fourtner Report\" gives [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] Mike a chance to show off his frontier medicine skills stitching up a lacerated rump roast.\n\nWild Bill joins in as the Captains discuss [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]-ing, coming up with fixes on the fly, and joined by someone who has done a lot of that in the past few episodes, rock star Edgar. Edgar comes up with an automated hook launcher, which meets with Jake Anderson's approval. Keith wants an automated crab sorting machine. Sig pushes for giant heaters on deck to keep the crew from freezing. Johnathan advocates heated rails to keep the crew from having to knock and chip ice off. Episode previews another impromptu Edgar fix for ''Northwestern'''s failing electrical system.\n\nAs the rest of the Captains take a break, Edgar and Bill discuss \"Elliott's Addiction\" problem from his pre-Opilio visit to ''Saga''.\n\nThe Captains discuss 2010, and screen highlights of Wild Bills rookie year from Season 6. Wild Bill's most memorable moment was a guy he met who said the hard conversation Bill had with Zack (from Season 9) brought he and his son back together, and is the featured \"10 Years of Catch\" clip.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=7\n |Title=Hit the Showers\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|1}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains begin by comparing what they see from the wheelhouse to action movies, and preview two injuries to ''Wizard'' crewmen, analyze stupid mistakes made by a ''Saga'' deckhand getting him fired by Elliott, and greenhorn Mandy partaking in a \"Gross\" herring ritual on ''Northwestern''. That leads into a discussion by the Captains on smelly crew, complete with a \"Wild Bill on the Scene\" report on the smelliest crew member on each boat. Edgar joins in as the Captains discuss crew showers and how they conserve their fresh water tanks, especially when a faulty valve leaks half of that supply, as happened to ''Northwestern'' in the previous week's episode, before Mandy's return to Dutch Harbor.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\" (with Sig saying \"That's a crew member, by the way!\") is Mandy, getting grilled by the Captains and Edgar on her first crab fishing trip at sea.\n\nComing out of break, the Captains and Wild Bill chow down on burgers from episode sponsor [[Carl's Jr.]]/[[Hardee's]] and Mike Rowe reveals that Sig delivered the classic quote \"I want the crab count and I want it now!\" Andy takes \"The Hot Seat\" as highlights of his rookie year from Season 2 are shown, capped by the previous week's hydraulic fluid leak on the ''Time Bandit''.\n\nIn \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike explains just how bad a hydro leak can be, and demonstrates the low flash point with a spray bottle of hydraulic fluid and hand torch. Best of Catch Poll topic: \"Close Calls\".\n\nIn a special history lesson, explorer Keith dons an 18th-century captain's tri-corner hat and wig to discuss the explorer [[Vitus Bering]], whom the sea is named after.\n\nReturning to the injury theme, they discuss the ''Cape Caution'''s injured greenhorn from two weeks ago, and Zack Larson returns to \"The Hot Seat\" to discuss that and how Zack's hire did better than Bill's king crab greenhorn did, and the Zack/Nick arguments on how to treat him. In the \"10 Years of Catch\" clip, more jovial Season 9 times for Zack and Nick are shown.\n\nJosh and Casey join the Captains (with Casey eyeing cheeseburgers) discussing the dynamic on the ''Cornelia Marie'' with Josh being boat owner/Captain in training and Casey toeing a fine line keeping the crew safe and trying to catch crab in the process. Josh and Casey grab burgers on the way out.\n\nCelebrity question from [[Iron Chef]] [[Alex Guarnaschelli]], and the Captains answer a user question about the most keepers they've had in a crab pot.\n\nIn another \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike demonstrates how hard it is to hit the crab consistently.\n\nCasey and cheeseburger pop up from behind the couch to close the episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=8\n |Title=Unnecessary Roughness\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|15}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains kick off by discussing what they would change about this opilio season, knowing what they know now. Keith would not have gone as far north nor let so much ice build up; Andy wished he had caught his hydraulic leak sooner, leading into a previews of do-over wishes from that night's episode on the ''Cape Caution'', ''Time Bandit'', and ''Cornelia Marie'' and recaps of the ''Wizard'' and ''Cornelia Marie'' injuries from a few weeks earlier.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\" is Josh, talking about the rough start fishing and with the rigging in the loaner pots not properly prepared. Josh and Sig have a vigorous discussion about apologizing for a crewman getting slammed by bad seas, and how Josh restored morale with the ''Cornelia Marie'''s favorite ritual, the mohawk. \"10 Years of Catch\" shows the first mohawks from Season 4 and last week's bring-back.\n\nSpeaking of rituals, previews of that night's episode show how the fleet got ready to root for the Seahawks in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] as Josh and the Captains dig into burgers from episode sponsor [[Carl's Jr.]]/[[Hardee's]] before going to break.\n\nWild Bill sits in for Johnathan as they roll out \"Best of Catch\" Poll: Oddest Rituals, which features a Season 10 clip in a poll for the first time (Norman Hansen chowing down on the herring). They then discuss one of the oldest sailor's superstitions about having women on a boat being bad luck, yet Sig brought daughter Mandy out to sea, and she's next up in \"The Hot Seat\", talking about her herring ritual and getting flamed when napping too long between strings.\n\nAs they start to talk about Mandy getting preferential treatment as Captain Sig's daughter, Uncle Edgar and the rest of the ''Northwestern'' crew (sans Uncle Norman) commandeer the set to do just that, as Sig replaces Mandy in \"The Hot Seat\".\n\nAs Sig reclaims his normal chair and the rest of the Captains return, Elliott is next on set, as footage from his rookie year in Season 7 is shown, and he discusses his four years on the show to date. They then discuss Elliott bringing his girlfriend on deck as the ''Saga'''s cook (not unprecedented, since ''Maverick'' had Captain Rick Quashnick's wife, Donna, as cook back in Season 1).\n\nSpeaking of young Captains, we finally get an update on Junior, six weeks after back surgery, and in a humorous clip, \"Junior Done?\", we see what Junior might be doing if he doesn't return for crab fishing next year, like drive a New York Water Taxi.\n\nWild Bill is still filling in as discussion turns to Zack and the ''Cape Caution'', and Zack is next up in \"The Hot Seat\", discussing the previous episode's bilge alarm. In \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike visits the ''Northwestern'', docked in Seattle, to demonstrate why it's imperative for a boat to pump its bilge regularly.\n\nJohnathan rejoins Wild Bill and the Captains as the second half of the poll rituals are reviewed (including another Season 10 clip, the ''Northwestern'''s flaming hook). In a second edition of \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike answers Wild Bill and Andy's question if those rituals really work. Wild Bill and the Captains chow down on cheeseburgers to close the episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |Title=The Red Zone\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|29}}\n |ShortSummary=\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |Title=Touchdown\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|8|5}}\n |ShortSummary=\n}}\n|}\n\n=== ''On Deck'' ===\nIn the ninth season in 2013, Discovery continued the trend of expanded show notes and unaired scenes in its series with ''Deadliest Catch: On Deck''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2881230/|title=Deadliest Catch: On Deck|accessdate=19 March 2019|website=IMDb.com}}</ref> ''On Deck'' episode titles are the same as the ''Deadliest Catch'' episode they expand on.\n\n==== ''On Deck'' 1 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| # !!

It portrays the [[real life]] events aboard [[fishing vessel]]s in the [[Bering Sea]] during the [[Alaskan king crab]], [[Chionoecetes|queen crab]], [[Chionoecetes opilio|and snow crab]] fishing seasons. The [[Aleutian Islands]] port of [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]], is the base of operations for the [[fishing fleet]]. The show's title derives from the inherent high risk of injury or death associated with the work.\n\n''Deadliest Catch'' premiered on the Discovery Channel on April 12, 2005, and the show currently airs worldwide. The first season consisted of ten episodes, with the finale airing on June 14, 2005. Subsequent seasons have aired on the same April to June or July schedule every year since the original 2005 season.

The Hansen brothers on board the ''Northwestern'' decide not to launch any more pots and instead go after a string of pots in the northern king crab waters that Sig dubs \"Long Tall Sally\"; the decision is rewarded when the pots come in huge, enabling the ''Northwestern'' to win the final King Crab Derby title. The crews rush to finish pulling in the last of the crab pots for the season and head back to [[Dutch Harbor]] to get in line for the crab processor.

The weather was treacherous, with heavy gale warnings and high seas predicted. The ''Lady Alaska'' had to return to port due to electrical problems, costing them a day of the already short season. The ''Northwestern'' headed out to the far northern Opilio fishing grounds, near the Russian border. As the rest of the boats neared the fishing grounds, a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] alert was issued to the fleet: An [[EPIRB]], belonging to the F/V ''Big Valley'', had been activated, and no one on the ''Big Valley'' was answering radio hails or satellite phone calls. Three fishing vessels, including ''Maverick'' and the ''Cornelia Marie'', started the search, joined just before dawn by a Coast Guard helicopter, but found nothing at the position indicated by the EPIRB. As dawn broke, debris from the ''Big Valley'' was all that could be seen, making it clear that the boat sunk. A single life raft from the ''Big Valley'' was found with one survivor, deck boss Cache Seel, in it. Seel, who had managed to get into his survival suit before getting tossed into the sea, confirmed that the ''Big Valley'' capsized and went down quickly; three men died shortly after falling into the sea with no survival suits on.

The ship was unable to rescue him, bringing the death toll to six before the first 24 hours had passed. Captain Jeff Weeks of the Billikin realizes that the dead crewman from the ''Sultan'' is a friend of one of his own crewmen, who earlier expressed hope that his friend was not the one who died.

This rumor pushed the crews harder, so boats were wondering where to put the extra crab. Other boats were just now hitting the sweet spot, and trying to make up for lost time. As the announcement of the end of the season arrives, giving boats just 36 more hours to work the fishing grounds, fatigued crews are pushed to work as hard as they can in the remaining time. Alaska crab fishing is normally done in a derby-style competition, where crews catch as much crab as they can during the season; the 2005 Opilio season would be the last year fishing like this, and the resulting IFQ (Individual Fishing Quota) system will put many smaller boats (like the ''Lady Alaska'') out of business. All the captains express a great desire to make this last run the best; the ''Maverick'' hustles to fill their tanks a second time in the short season.\n |LineColor       = 5EC5C4\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = The Final Run\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|14}}\n |ShortSummary    = This opilio season had been a deadly one, with the deaths of the ''Big Valley'' crew and a crewman from the ''Sultan'' who fell overboard just hours later. Boats were reaching their holding tank capacities and crews were reaching their mental and physical limits, but the fleet kept going in an effort to catch the year's wages in the remaining 24 hours. The ''Northwestern'' builds a \"deck load\", a holding pen to store the crab from their last pots on deck with water passing over them in hopes that they will survive long enough to reach the processors. As the last few hours ticked down, the second leg of the race began, the race to the processing plants. Off-loading is done on a first-come, first-served basis, making decisions of when to return to port critical to the success of a season. Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'', knowing his deck load will not last long in the weather, gathers the last of his pots and sets course for the processors. Though the trip to the processor should be the safest part of the trip, Hansen relates the story of the ''St. Patrick'', whose crew abandoned ship in December 1981 just a few miles from the Kodiak as their boat took on water; only two crew members survived, a loss made even more tragic by the knowledge that the ''St. Patrick'' had managed to right itself after the crew abandoned ship and did not sink until several days after it had been successfully towed into port. As luck would have it, the ''Northwestern'' becomes one of the first boats to arrive at the processors, and their deck load weathered the journey well; however, the crew takes great pleasure in riding a fellow crewman's poor observation skills when his tally of the crab poundage fails to match up with the official total by over 20,000 pounds. Since crab will not last forever on a boat's hold, a crab boat's place in line to get to the processor is crucial; access to the processor is limited, and the wait could be hours or even days. Days would cost thousands in dead crab; when crab die in a boat's hold, their deceased bodies release poisons into the hold that affect all the crab, often resulting in a chain reaction of deaths creating massive amounts of \"deadloss\", or dead crabs that cannot be processed. The ''Maverick'' lost a portion of their load to deadloss when their wait in line for the processor turned into an extra week at sea, but the rest of their load held up well and the boat turned a nice profit, becoming one of the few vessels to have filled their holding tanks twice within the short Opilio season. The ''Northwestern'' won the 2005 Derby with the highest overall catch total in both halves of the Alaskan crab season (King and Opilio). Captains who would not return for the new IFQ-style fishing bid their crews goodbye as they return to port; other captains who would be going on under [[Individual fishing quota|IFQ]] acknowledged that crab fishing, as they knew it, will change forever with the end of the Derby era.\n |LineColor        = 5EC5C4\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 2 (2006) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#EDCC26 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=30 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Heading Out to Sea\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|28}}\n |ShortSummary    = The crew returned to their boats in October 2005 for the start of the first King Crab season run under Individual Fishing Quota (\"IFQ\") rules. The fleet had been cut by over half due to new regulations and quotas; however, the season had also been lengthened to three weeks in an effort to make crab fishing safer by not forcing boats to fish during a small window of time that might be compromised by poor conditions on the Bering Sea. The returning captains toasted each other in the traditional pre-season dinner at the UniSea bar, with Phil Harris, captain of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and 20+ year rival of the Hansens on the Bering Sea, noting that he missed \"being able to beat (''Northwestern'' Captain Sig Hansen's) ass\" under the new IFQ system, to which Sig Hansen responded that he glad he was \"the ass to beat.\" The 2005 King Crab season was due to start on October 14, 2005; however, many boats decided not to leave port due to two reasons: Predicted severe weather over the fishing grounds, and superstition for \"Unlucky Friday\". The ''Time Bandit'' defied the superstition and left anyway, but its first few pots were nearly empty. The fishing picked up for the ''Time Bandit'' eventually. The ''Cornelia Marie'' had just started setting their pots when their main engine blew a head gasket. Mindful of the bad weather to come, Captain Phil Harris ordered his crew to offload the pots as fast as possible so that they could return to Dutch Harbor with an empty deck. Stuck at Dutch Harbor was the ''Maverick'', which had failed its Coast Guard safety inspection; because the sinking of the ''Big Valley'' in January 2005 had been attributed at least in part to carrying a pot load 30% over its declared pot weight, all the boats got extra scrutiny about their pot loads, and the ''Maverick'' was carrying 30 more pots than was considered safe under the USCG rules. ''Maverick'' deck boss Blake Painter had been promised a promotion to Captain at the mid-point of the king crab season; getting the boat cleared by the Coast Guard was the first test current Captain Rick Quashnick gave to Blake to measure his readiness to take command. The new IFQ system gave each boat a quota of crabs to catch (often larger than the boats' previous take due to the decimation of the fleet) and a longer time window to catch them; thus, out at sea, as the weather worsened with warnings of severe storms approaching, captains had to make decisions about whether to continue fishing through the storm (as would be the case under the derby system) or find a safe port until the weather clears. \n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title=Batten Down the Hatches\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|4}}\n |ShortSummary    = As a pair of storm systems began converging on the fishing grounds, several boats faced major mechanical issues made even more dangerous by the bad weather. The ''Rollo'' had a number of problems common to older fishing boats: Leaking hydraulic lines on the crane; broken hoses on the coiling block; two old ropes giving way on two separate pots, causing both the loss of the pots and the crabs therein; and a broken steering computer. The ''Cornelia Marie'' limped back to Dutch Harbor with a blown head gasket that turned out to be worse than expected; parts had to be ordered from the Alaskan mainland, costing the crew time and money. The ''Maverick'' finally passed its Coast Guard inspection but stayed at Dutch Harbor due to weather conditions. Crew members on the ''Maverick'' voiced their discontent with Blake's verbal excitement about taking on the job of Captain at mid-season, and even Captain Rick Quashnick appeared skeptical. As the weather changed, the ''Maverick'' finally left Dutch Harbor to join the rest of the fleet, while the ''Northwestern'', after heavy discussions between the Hansen brothers, decided to seek refuge from the converging storms behind [[Amak Island]].\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = On the Crab\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|11}}\n |ShortSummary    = The crews made headway in bringing crab on-board and fought even more rough weather. The ''Maverick'' dealt with two crew issues: Blake's continued trumpeting his coming rise to the captain's chair that had been verbally promised to him by Captain Quashnick during the offseason; and angry veteran crewmember Hiram, who was frustrated that the ''Maverick'' was employing a greenhorn (who was excited about seeing full pots coming aboard) while many of his own friends, crab veterans with far more experience, had been put out of work by the IFQ system. Boat Mother Donna Quashnick counseled the ''Maverick'' crew to give Hiram time to vent, and the next morning the squabble seemed forgotten as the crew returned to work. The ''Cornelia Marie'', fresh off extensive engine repairs at Dutch Harbor, had just reached the fishing grounds and begun retrieving their pots that had been left soaking for days when the same engine threw a piston, creating even more destructive engine damage and forcing Captain Harris to take the boat back to Dutch Harbor again. The ''Northwestern'' continued their annual tradition of finding superb fishing grounds away from other boats, pulling in pots with nearly 70 crabs each on average, but when another severe storm approached the fleet, the Hansens weighed the odds of their nearly full tanks surviving the battering of an Arctic squall without serious deadloss and decided to head for the processors and cash out their load before the bad weather hit. The ''Rollo'' continued to have serious equipment issues, losing their GPS indicator in the middle of the night during a blizzard.\n |LineColor=EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Finish Line\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|18}}\n |ShortSummary    = Many of the crews, including the ''Northwestern'' and ''Maverick'', headed to St. Paul Island to offload their northern IFQ share catches. The ''Northwestern'' catch was smaller than expected, putting Sig Hansen significantly behind on making his overall quota; however, none of the ''Northwestern'' crew voiced anything but praise for their captain's fishing instincts. Edgar Hansen, ''Northwestern'' Deck Boss and Sig's younger brother, notes that \"That man has made me more money than I could wish for, and he's kept us safe while doing it\u2014no fatalities, no major injuries, knock on wood.\" As the ''Maverick'' headed for the processors at St. Paul, deck boss Blake Painter hung up his deck oilskins for what he hoped would be the last time, anticipating taking over as Captain of the ''Maverick'' once the ''Maverick'' reached St. Paul Island. However, Captain Rick Quashnick began having second thoughts about leaving his ship to a new captain in the middle of a crab season, especially since the crewmember who would be interim deck boss with Blake's promotion vowed to quit rather than work for Blake. Quashnick made the difficult choice to forgo his retirement at least until the end of this King Crab season, angering Blake, who had been chasing a dream \"ever since I was four years old...all I wanted to be was the captain of a red crab boat.\" Seeing Blake's passion for the job of captain and not merely a passion for the extra money such a job would bring impresses Hiram, who finally turns from Blake's harshest critic to one of his strongest defenders; \"He'll make his mark on fishing, no doubt about it. To be so young and so mature at the same time...he'll make a fine captain.\" The ''Rollo'' finally catches a break in both the weather and the crab catching and started to make headway on their catching their own IFQ shares for the season when a [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] cruiser hailed the captain and announced they will be boarding for a surprise mid-season inspection. Both captain and crew on the ''Rollo'' were very nervous, especially since the 9-man inspection team essentially took over the boat for the next three hours, but finally the USCG pronounced them \"in full compliance\" and departed. The ''Northwestern'' returned to where they had left pots soaking before their side trip to the processors and found all the pots full; however, their joy was cut short when one of the hydraulic arms on the launcher snapped a connector pin, rendering it useless. Sig's repair\u2014essentially using a sledgehammer to drive in a new pin into the pneumatic cylinder\u2014lasted all of 10 seconds; when Edgar tried to close the launcher, the connector and pin shot out of the launcher like a harpoon. The Hansens decided to risk running the launcher on one hydraulic lift and returned to pulling pots. Aboard the ''Aleutian Ballad'', a greenhorn became so distraught by the extreme conditions of the Bering Sea that he threatened to jump off the boat right then and there and kill himself, forcing Captain Corky Tilley to return to Dutch Harbor with the young man on the edge of a nervous breakdown the entire way. An [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] Police Officer escorted the greenhorn personally from the dock to the airport to ensure his departure from Dutch Harbor without further incident. By the time the ''Aleutian Ballad'' returned to sea, the storm surge was more brutal than ever, and a [[rogue wave]] hit the ''Aleutian Ballad'', knocking it nearly 90 degrees over and trashing the wheelhouse.\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Friends and Rivals\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = The ''Aleutian Ballad'', knocked over by a rogue wave, managed to right itself, but with several crew members injured\u2014including Captain Tilley's own daughter, Nicole\u2014as well as its computer not coming back on line and the wheelhouse and deck damaged, Captain Tilley decided to return to port for repairs rather than risk more damage in the storms. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' discussed a change in duty with his ship's greenhorn\u2014Harris' youngest son, Jacob\u2014and declared that Jake may finally be ready to take shifts inside the wheelhouse so that the captain can get some rest, which had been a goal of Jake's all season long. As the fishing continued at full speed aboard the ''Northwestern'', Edgar Hansen decides to celebrate the launch of the last pot string of the season with a traditional Norwegian meal of boiled [[salt cod]], Captain Sig's favorite dish. The ''Rollo'' dealt with a coffee crisis\u2014down to less than half a can of grounds left, they still had a long string of pots to pull in before the end of the season, so the remaining coffee was rationed until the final pot was pulled; the crew celebrated the end of their season with the last pot of coffee left. Blake Painter, still upset about being passed over for the captain's job on the ''Maverick'', expressed his hope that he will still get to pilot the ''Maverick'' soon, perhaps as early as the upcoming Opilio season. The ''Cornelia Marie'', still needing to catch crab to fill its large quota, moved closer to the same grounds being fished by the ''Northwestern''. When Sig Hansen spotted a ''Cornelia Marie'' pot off the bow, he suggested to his crew that they \"mess with it\" as payback for Phil Harris' pre-season comment that he would miss \"beating (Sig's) ass\" under the new IFQ rules. The ''Northwestern'' crew hauled the pot up\u2014\"They've got more crab than we do!\" Edgar observed\u2014then hooked fishing gloves and a pair of thong underwear to the bait hook and welded the door shut before returning the pot to the ocean. As night fell over the fishing grounds, the ''Cornelia Marie'' retrieved the pot and were mystified by the welded door as well as the \"party boy\" underwear in the pot; Phil Harris expressed a belief that \"my fat little buddy Rick (Quashnick, of the ''Maverick'')\" pulled the prank and radioed the ''Maverick'' for confirmation. Captain Rick Quashnick denied his involvement; however, Sig listened in on the conversation over the radio and decided to call Harris and see how long it would take before Harris figured out who really pulled the prank. Once Phil figured out the truth from Sig's denials that he would ever pull such a prank\u2014\"I would ''never'' do such a thing\u2014that would be illegal!\" Sig asserted\u2014the two men shared a laugh about the prank, but Harris got the last word by pulling a ''Northwestern'' pot and filling it with garbage, then mounting a steel pipe over part of the \"shot\" (rope length), which would interfere with the ''Northwestern'' retrieval block and give them a half-ton dead weight hanging off the side of the boat. As the ''Northwestern'' crew pulled their last pots up, they discovered the altered pot; Edgar figured out how to bypass the retrieval block and pull the pot aboard by the pipe around the rope. The ''Northwestern'' crew then discovered that all their crab were taken out of the pot and the pot had been refilled with garbage from the ''Cornelia Marie''; Sig salutes his rival and gives the pipe-over-rope trick a \"9\" on the practical joke scale. The boats returned to Dutch Harbor to offload at the end of the season, one of the first seasons in years with no recorded deaths.\n |LineColor       = EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = A New Hunt Begins\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = The opilio crab season officially began, but a forecast for wind and heavy icing, which can make the vessels top heavy, forced many captains to wait out the storm in Dutch Harbor. As in king crab season, the ''Time Bandit'' threw caution to the wind and left early. The ''Rollo'' fished grounds long abandoned, and after a few pots with only tanner crab, which are out of season, they pulled some pots with respectable numbers of crab. The ''Maverick'' put to sea without longtime deck boss Blake Painter, who took the season off to deal with the impending death of a relative and other family issues.

The ''Northwestern'' crew was less than pleased with Sig's demanding fishing pace, so as a gesture of good faith, Sig left a coffee can marked \"Suggestion Box\" in the galley so that the crew could voice their complaints. Aboard the ''Rollo'', the crew fudged the number of crabs caught per pot; under the IFQ system, quotas are divided between southern and northern shares, so when the ''Rollo'' arrived at processors near St. Paul Island (where the northern share processors are located) and their center tank was opened, the amount of crab in the tank were considerably over the allotted northern share and Captain Eric Nyhammer was assessed a large fine for going over quota. Eric announced to his crew that he was taking the fines out of the crew pay, since they were the ones who had miscounted the crab. As the ''Rollo'' was about to leave St. Paul to return to the southern fishing grounds, they were boarded by the [[Alaska Department of Commerce]] police and informed that under the IFQ rules, they could not leave St. Paul until they emptied all of their tanks, including one of the tanks with crab from the southern fishing grounds, which forced Eric to sell the crabs on board for under market prices. The injured crewman on the ''Cornelia Marie'' was diagnosed with a severe ankle sprain and the boat is forced to return to the fishing grounds shorthanded with Captain Phil Harris's son, greenhorn Jake, taking up the slack; the lack of a fifth man on board slowed the pace of the deck crew by almost 50%. The ''Maverick'' continued to pull full pots while fishing on a sandbar, but as the ice approached, Captain Rick decided to chance leaving the rest of the gear in place and take his northern share up to St. Paul to drop off crab rather than risk losing the crabs that had been in the tank for nearly two weeks.\n |LineColor=EDCC26 \n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=22\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=Cashing In\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|6|13}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Time Bandit'' picked up its last string of pots, with mediocre results.

On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', last season's greenhorn, Jake Harris, got a promotion to deckhand; the vessel's new greenhorn is Joshua Harris, Jake's older brother and Phil's eldest son. The new hand on board the ''Northwestern'' is Stan Hansen, cousin to the Hansen brothers; meanwhile, the ''Farwest Leader'' brings Ragnhild Moncrief, the captain's wife, aboard as their new greenhorn/cook/den mother. The '' Maverick'' is now under Blake Painter's control, and his crew is virtually all friends of his who are King-crab greenhorns, with only one experienced deck hand acting as Deck Boss. The crews go shopping for their season's crew provisions, spending around $5500 each trip. At the pre-season captains' dinner, Johnathan Hillstrand proposed a derby-style competition between the boats: Fewest pots needed to pull 100,000 pounds of crab. Sig Hansen upped the ante by proposing each captain kick in $100 for the prize to be given to the winner, and the UniSea Bar agreed to safeguard the $900 bounty. After dinner, the Hansen brothers decided to initiate the first pranks of the season by leaving a bag of bait fish under the Captain's chair on board the ''Maverick''. The ''Cornelia Marie'' left Dutch Harbor hoping to catch a break between two storms, leaving the other boats to ride out the storms tied to the dock. The ''Northwestern'' tried a new strategy of more and bigger crab pots, carrying 150 pots on the initial trip out to the grounds, then returning to Dutch Harbor for 150 more pots afterwards as a way of capturing their very large quota shares at a faster pace. Several captains explained their strategies for setting crab pots in the Bering Sea\u2014Sig Hansen looks at history, checks the official Alaska Fish and Game reports, then sets test pots for long soaks and evaluates patterns of crab caught in the test pots; ''Wizard'' Captain Keith Colburn tries to determine the best balance between history and state reports, noting that many captains spend time \"chasing last year's crab\" and not enough time doing test pot launching and trend watching; ''Cornelia Marie'' Captain Phil Harris noted that when the water is warmer, crabs move northward, but when the water is colder overall, crabs tend to stay in the shallows and it can be hard to determine how shallow is too shallow. Rookie Captain Blake Painter of the ''Maverick'', who had been very confident during the captains' dinner about being able to find the crab on his own, became indecisive about where to drop his pots once the ''Maverick'' reached the fishing grounds and spent most of the first day out at sea \"radio crabbing\"\u2014calling other captains on the radio for tips on where they were finding crab\u2014which annoyed several of the veterans who had cautioned Blake against this very thing. During the first night, the ''Ocean Challenger'' capsized and put out a distress call, and by dawn, only one of the four crewmembers was found in a survival suit.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=24\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=The Unforgiving Sea\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary=The search for the crew of the ''Ocean Challenger'' continued by air and by the [[USCGC Douglas Munro (WHEC-724)|USCGC ''Douglas Munro'']].<ref name=\"Ocean Challenger\">{{cite press release|title=COAST GUARD SUSPENDS SEARCH FOR MISSING CREWMAN FROM OCEAN CHALLENGER|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=October 20, 2006|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/135933/|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref> The bodies of two crewmembers, without survival suits, were recovered, while the fourth crewmember was lost to the sea. The survivor, Kevin Ferrell, tells his story to the Coast Guard. The fleet reacted to the loss of the ''Ocean Challenger''. The ''Northwestern'' set its second load of 150 pots while dealing with a broken hose on the hydraulic launchers. Deck boss Edgar Hansen committed the karmic ''faux pas'' of estimating their catch before it's pulled. The ''Time Bandit'' finally set its pots using [[herring]] instead of [[cod]] for hanging bait with poor results. After a slow start, the ''Maverick'' pulled in full pots and returned to St. Paul to offload. The ''Cornelia Marie'' fished through the night at a fast pace. Rough seas on the ''Farwest Leader'' made greenhorn Ragnhild sick, but she pulled through and worked the deck after losing a bet on the number of crab pulled up in the first pot of the season; although she started out at the bait station loading bait buckets for pots, she gradually got over her fear of the snapping king crab to move to the sorting table and assist in the crab sort and count process.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=25\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Pain and Paybacks\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|17}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' had bad luck with its second string of 150 pots and decided to fish closer to its first set of pots where they had better luck. ''Northwestern'' deckhand Matt Bradley finally confessed to Captain Sig Hansen that he was due to be in court before the official end of the season for an outstanding criminal case that could land him up to eight months in jail; Sig chastised Matt for waiting so long to tell him of this important deadline, reminding him that there was no way to predict when the boat would catch enough to reach its quota. Rough seas caused a crewmember aboard the ''Wizard'' to have his finger crushed between two pots, which required professional medical attention at Dutch Harbor, a return to port which Captain Keith Colburn admitted was going to cost the crew thousands of dollars in lost fishing time but was necessary to avoid costing crew member Lenny Lekanoff his finger. When the ''Time Bandit'' pulled in low crab counts after having to move their greenhorn to the rail due to an injury to veteran crewmember Russ Newberry, the Hillstrand brothers decided to have a little fun at the expense of the greenhorn with a \"flour pot\"\u2014a pot with several trash bags full of flour tied to the rope, which would burst when pulled up through the hydraulic block; the trick worked to perfection as greenhorn Nate put the sabotaged pot's rope into the blocks, only to be covered in exploding white powder seconds later. Captain Blake Painter of the ''Maverick'' received a tip on a hot spot to fish from Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'', but Phil made him promise not to share it with anyone else; however, Blake decided to share the tip with Captain Corky Tilley of the ''Aleutian Ballad'' as a sign that he was willing to give information and not merely take it from other captains, not realizing that Phil was listening in on the same communication band Blake was using. An annoyed Phil got his revenge on Blake's betrayal by sabotaging one of the ''Maverick's'' pots, doing a variation on the ''Northwestern'' welded door trick: The ''Cornelia Marie'' crew emptied all the crab out of the pot (\"Thanks, Blake!\" crew members declared on-camera as they put 50-something keepers in their tanks), put ''Cornelia Marie'' bait boxes into the pot, welded the door shut, turned the pot around backwards and re-strung the \"bridle\" (the loop to which the pot shots are tied for retrieval) through the welded door, then relaunched the pot, with Phil declaring \"That's how you {#bleep#} with somebody, ''Cornelia Marie'' style\". The ''Farwest Leader'' had declining numbers of crabs in their pots, leading Captain Greg Moncrief to challenge his wife Ragnhild Moncrief to pick a better spot for fishing; Ragnhild picked a spot to the northwest of their current position, and was rewarded with a number of full pots pulled in return, prompting the crew to dub her \"Captain Ragny\". The ''Farwest Leader'' crew painted a grappling hook bright pink in honor of Ragnhild's increasing confidence in crabbing, and she got to toss the hook to retrieve one of the pots, snagging the line on her second try. The ''Cornelia Marie'' broke off a part of one her propellers and went to [[King Cove, Alaska|King Cove]] for emergency repairs.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=26\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Cheating Death\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary=The fishing aboard the ''Northwestern'' was excellent and the crew filled their tanks to the brim, though the repetitive nature of fishing 300 pots became exhausting for the crew; on their way to another string of pots, Captain Sig Hansen and his crew discussed whether or not to take a break, with the decision by Sig to keep going, leaving Edgar to comment, \"If Sig had any people skills, they were lost long ago. Only thing that keeps us going is the money.\" A replacement propeller was flown in for the ''Cornelia Marie'', but repairs were delayed because the propeller is left handed, while the ''Cornelia Marie's'' propellers are right handed. Several days later, a second propeller arrived and is installed, allowing the boat to return to fishing, but not before Captain Phil Harris discovered his blood pressure was up in the 180/120 range; when Phil discovered that Jake and Josh had been charging shopping at Dutch Harbor to Phil's accounts, he cut off credit for both of them and blew his stack at them for spending his money so indiscriminately after Phil had just spent thousands of dollars on boat repairs. Jake and Josh both shrugged off Phil's anger, and Jake gave the captain a back massage as a peace offering. Aboard the ''Maverick'', Captain Blake Painter fabricated a temporary fix for a broken [[Dog (engineering)|dog]] on the pot launcher, then retrieved their sabotaged pot moments later; Blake declared the prank pot \"lame\". On their way to [[Akutan, Alaska|Akutan]] to offload, Blake spotted a ''Cornelia Marie'' pot and decided to take revenge by sabotaging the pot with backwards bridles and garbage offloads, but it caused little reaction on the ''Cornelia Marie'' when they retrieved it. On the ''Farwest Leader'', a junior deckhand at the hydraulic controls caused an accident after failing to secure a pot and then broke the crane line, leaving Captain Greg Moncrief to comment to his wife that such accidents were why it was not safe to stand around the sorting tables while the pots were being emptied onto it. After poor results with their test pots, the ''Time Bandit'' pulled all their pots out of their current fishing grounds, changed strategy, and moved north. On the way to the northern end of the fishing grounds, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand observed a deckhand on another boat tying a pot stack off the side of another vessel, the ''Trailblazer''. After the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' headed below for some rest, the man tying the stack was overwhelmed by the 30-foot swells and disappeared into the waves. Captain Hillstrand and his crew worked quickly to save the fisherman who fell into the sea. Their quick action saved the man from certain death, and the fisherman was overjoyed by the swift rescue efforts of the ''Time Bandit'' and her crew. Johnathan and the rescued fisherman were both overwhelmed with emotions after the rescue\u2014ten years earlier, the ''Time Bandit'' had rescued a fishing boat crew in a similar situation but was unable to save one of the fishermen, and the memory had haunted the Hillstrands for years afterward; with this successful save, the Hillstrand brothers said they felt they had finally settled the score with the past for the loss of that fisherman.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=27\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=Bering Sea Salvation\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary=Good fortune smiled upon the ''Time Bandit'' after the rescue of the man overboard as they pulled up very full pots in a once-in-a-lifetime season. The ''Northwestern'' continued to have good luck after offloading nearly $800,000 in crab, though deckhand Matt Bradley was continuing to struggle with the uncertainty about making his upcoming court date. Edgar Hansen painted prison stripes on Matt's oilskins as payback for Matt's continued complaints about not wanting to spend Christmas in jail\u2014\"don't do the crime if you don't want to do the time,\" Edgar reminded the deckhand. Aboard the ''Maverick'', Captain Blake Painter decided to risk striking out on his own and picked a spot to fish without any advice from other captains, resulting in full pots. Lenny, the injured engineer aboard the ''Wizard'', returned to work the deck for the last strings. The ''Farwest Leader'' pulled up empty pots, but pulled up decent pots after receiving a tip from Johnathan Hillstrand on the ''Time Bandit''.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=28\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=The Last Lap\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|8}}\n |ShortSummary=The boats rushed to pull up their last pots in order to meet their delivery deadlines at the processing plants. The ''Farwest Leader'' had one of their best seasons ever, and Raghnild Moncrief celebrated getting over her fear of the big king crabs by holding up one of the biggest crabs for the cameras during the offload at Akutan. Sig Hansen, knowing that the price of king crab will go down in a day, rushed the ''Northwestern'' to Akutan to empty its tanks, pulling in over $1M for his quota shares; more importantly, by getting to port ahead of schedule, Matt Bradley was able to catch a plane that night back to Seattle to avoid missing his court date. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' won the bet between the captains on the fewest pots pulled to 100,000 lbs. by averaging 70 crabs per pot; upon receiving his prize at the UniSea Bar, Johnathan donated a portion of the money to the Seafarer's Memorial fund, and Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' matched it. The ''Maverick'', which had been ahead in the crab-per-pot race the entire season until the ''Time Bandit'' went on their hot streak, \"rail dumped\" several pots thinking that they had reached their quota, only to find out they were actually 4,000 lbs. under quota when they offloaded at [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]]. Blake was very upset and confused by his miscalculation of the load, and, since he was not returning for Opilio season, would have to wait to have a shot at redemption.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=New Beginnings\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|15}}\n |ShortSummary=The fleet began the opilio crab season. ''Northwestern'' deckhand Matt Bradley, who made his Seattle court date in time to avoid a lengthy jail sentence, returned to the ''Northwestern'' crew with his legal troubles behind him. The ''Northwestern'' added a new crew member, greenhorn Jake Anderson, from a multi-generational Norwegian fishing family, anxious to prove himself \"a man\" aboard the most respected ship in the fleet; Sig refused to greet him, as is his tradition with greenhorns. The ''Wizard'' also picked up a new greenhorn, Nick, to learn from greenhorn Crosby. After taking on Jake, the ''Northwestern'' went to pick up their pots stored near St. Paul Island and St. George Island and found that many of their [[buoy]]s had been damaged by playful [[sea lion]]s. The ''Time Bandit'', captained by Andy Hillstrand, headed to a secret opilio fishing spot known only to the Hillstrand family. Out at sea, the ''Northwestern'' crew celebrated Matt Bradley's return to the boat by burning the prison-striped oilskins they made for him during King crab season; Sig was in a considerably less celebratory mood, noting to the cameras that as far as he was concerned, he had done Matt a huge favor by getting him back in time to go to court in the first place, adding that Matt needed to show some respect and gain some maturity. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Farwest Leader'' loaded up on provisions while waiting for the Coast Guard to conduct their inspections and drills. The [[fish processing boat]] ''Stellar Sea's'' engine room caught on fire, causing it to be towed to Dutch Harbor for repairs.<ref name=\"Stellar Sea\">{{cite press release | title=COAST GUARD RESPONDS TO VESSEL IN DISTRESS | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] | date=January 17, 2007|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/135653/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}<br />{{cite press release | title=PHOTO RELEASE COAST GUARD RESPONDS TO VESSEL IN DISTRESS | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=January 17, 2007|url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/142236/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}<br />{{cite press release | title=STELLAR SEA \u2013 UPDATE | publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] | date=January 18, 2007| url=http://www.uscgalaska.com/go/doc/780/142285/ | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref> The fire forced the ''Cornelia Marie'' and the ''Time Bandit'' to change their plans as they were contracted to deliver to the ''Stellar Sea''. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' decided to dock at St. Paul to wait until the stricken ''Stellar Sea'' was repaired, while Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' decided to switch to fishing [[Chionoecetes|bairdi crab]] which could be delivered to another processor. A Coast Guard [[HH-60 Jayhawk]] from USCG Air Station Kodiak was dispatched to rescue a seriously ill crew member from a fishing boat.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=30\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=Caught in the Storm\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|22}}\n |ShortSummary=The fleet dealt with a storm. The ''Time Bandit'' continued to fish for bairdi with poor results. The ''Farwest Leader'' loaded aboard 30 more pots at St. George, departed before the storm hit, and went fishing for bairdi crab. Aboard the ''Northwestern'', the crew thought their luck had changed when they pulled up full pots, but a mechanical problem with the engine forced them to go to St. Paul for repairs. The ''Stellar Sea'' was repaired and the ''Cornelia Marie'' went out to fish. The ''Wizard'' headed to port for repairs after a wave sheared the gears in the transmission of the forward crane.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=31\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Crossing the Line\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|5|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' pulled up full pots as the crew tried to make up for lost time. Although the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn, Jake, was becoming more accepted by the crew due to his eagerness to learn and his rapidly advancing skills, he learned the hard way that playing pranks on the deck boss is never a good idea; in response to Jake's snapping him with a spring-loaded bait hook, Edgar Hansen used cable ties to wrap Jake's [[oilskin]]s into a compact bundle, causing Jake to be late getting back out on deck for the next pot run. The deck crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and ''Time Bandit'' were battered by huge waves. Captain Keith Colburn handed over the ''Wizard'' to his brother, Monte, after having to return home due to a family emergency. The boat also picked up a new greenhorn\u2014Guy, a former rodeo cowboy\u2014after greenhorn Nick injured himself and had to leave the boat, but greenhorn Guy found the work difficult. A wave caused a line to tangle around the starboard shaft of the ''Time Bandit'', forcing the boat to return to port for repairs.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=32\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Trials of the Greenhorns\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|5}}\n |ShortSummary=In rough seas and cold weather that causes ice to build up, greenhorn Guy on the ''Wizard'' hit his breaking point and walked off the deck, leaving the rest of the crew to pick up his duties. Guy complained about a lack of respect from the crew and that there was \"no call\" for taunts that he \"pushes like a girl\" from the more experienced crew members, but Captain Monte chastised him that walking off the deck signaled that Guy was a \"quitter\" who \"couldn't handle the job\" he'd volunteered to do one day earlier. The other greenhorn on the ''Wizard'', Crosby, was amazed by Guy's retreat: \"He didn't even last 24 hours! Come on\u2014you can do anything for 24 hours!\" The ''Cornelia Marie'' hurried to pull up her pots before a severe storm with gale-force winds was due to hit. While pulling full pots, but with mostly rejects, the ''Farwest Leader's'' port engine broke, forcing the crew to shut down the engine and chain the shaft so that the propeller turning from the force of the water itself would not burn out the drive shaft. Captain Moncrief of the ''Farwest Leader'' decided to continue fishing with one engine, but switched from fishing bairdi to opilio crab. Pulling full pots that were set back on the same spot inspired Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' to swap jobs with his brother Edgar and work the deck, something he had not done for over twenty years; each man lasted only a short time at the other's job before both admitting they'd rather be in their regular slots, and switched places once more after Sig successfully pulled fifteen pots. Meanwhile, the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn Jake tried to prove himself by working the rail under \"Sig Rules\"\u2014that is, every miss cost him an article of clothing\u2014and successfully pulled in a string of thirteen pots, though his many misses resulted in him wearing little more than a sweatshirt and long johns by its completion; Jake's willingness to continue learning to throw the hook and retrieve pots earned him respect from both Sig and Edgar. However, Jake then pushed it too far and then learned a lesson on fishing \"old school style\" with no hydraulics and no automated conveyor belts transporting crab to the tanks after Edgar heard him complaining about his aching hands. At Dutch Harbor, Captain Andy Hillstrand cleared a tangled line from the shaft of the ''Time Bandit''. While the work was being done, greenhorn Nate was arrested for an outstanding warrant by the [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] Police and taken to jail; Johnathan and the rest of the crew headed for the nearest ATM to withdraw enough cash to pay Nate's bail so that he could return to fishing.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=33\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Ice and Open Water\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|12}}\n |ShortSummary=After heading north to scout for the January pack ice\u2014and having Edgar leave snow angels and the ''Northwestern'' logo on one of the larger floes of pack ice they encountered\u2014Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' hurried southward to pull his pots before the pack ice reached them. The disgruntled greenhorn Guy on the ''Wizard'' realized that it was not fair to his shipmates to stay inside, while the rest of the crew froze outside, chipping ice from the boat, so he returned to work. The increasingly cold weather and long working hours affected the ''Northwestern'' greenhorn, Jake, and he reached his breaking point, leading to a rare \"pep talk\" of sorts from Sig, which reminded Jake to keep focused on his goals. Fishing on one engine slowed the ''Farwest Leader'', but the boat brought up full pots. However, the captain's decision to carefully sort the crab caused the deck boss, Chilly, to become grumpy, forcing Captain Greg Moncrief to have to face-to-face discipline with Chilly. Captain Andy Hillstrand turned over the ''Time Bandit'' to his brother Johnathan after an emergency required Andy to return to his horse farm in [[Indiana]]. With Johnathan at the helm, the boat pulled up huge numbers of crab, and the crew restacked the gear in preparation for the end of the season after successfully retrieving their quota. Aboard the ''Cornelia Marie'', greenhorn Josh gained new respect for tossing the hook and working the rail after he discovered it is not as easy as it looks. On the ''Farwest Leader'', greenhorn Raghnild cut her hand in the galley and Deck Boss Chilly hurried downstairs with Captain Greg to help her; the distracted crew failed to notice that the launch signal had not been given and launched a crab pot. Unintended launches often cause pots to get accidentally dragged under fishing vessels due to the captain not being able to steer the boat away from the waves near the launch position; when Captain Greg discovered the launch, he had his crew [[keelhauling|keelhaul]] a line from bow to stern to confirm that no pots had gotten tangled underneath. Meanwhile, the ''Time Bandit'' quickly made up time lost due to their own tangled pot line and headed for St. Paul for their final offload, only to run headlong into the dangerous January pack ice.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=34\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=A Frozen Finish\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2007|6|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Time Bandit'' carefully made its way through the pack ice to the processing boat ''Independence'' at St. Paul Island. As the boat tried to leave St. Paul, it ran into too much ice and was forced to return to St. Paul and spend a tense night near the beach where the ''Alaskan Monarch'' ran aground in 1990 in the same conditions. As the pack ice tightened and bay rollers began shoving the boat toward the beach during the changing of the tide, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand sounded the emergency alarms to awaken his crew and ordered all of them to take ice watches\u2014including going down into the holds to watch the ship's walls for puncture marks from the huge ice floes\u2014as he struggled to find a way back to open water. By dawn, the ''Time Bandit'' finally spotted open water and made their way out of the remaining pack ice; the ship's hull was creased and dented but remained intact, and the ''Time Bandit'' headed back to Dutch Harbor. Aboard the ''Wizard'', greenhorn Guy continued to lag behind and left the deck for the second time after being reprimanded by the captain, angrily cursing out the captain and crew and quitting the job for good, voicing his intention to \"jump off the boat\" as soon as they returned to Dutch Harbor. After greenhorn Crosby picked up the slack left by Guy's defection, Captain Monte Colburn decided to give him a 0.5% bonus out of his own share. The ''Farwest Leader'' had a lot of deadloss due to their bad engine slowing their pace\u2014some of their crab had been in the hold for 14 days\u2014but still managed to have a good season. Greenhorn Ragnhild Moncrief of the ''Farwest Leader'' decided that there was no place on a crab boat for a woman because there were so few jobs women could do, and declared she felt as if she had been a \"wasted space\" the entire season despite her notable contributions to the season's success. Aboard the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris and his two sons had their annual line coiling contest and the surprise winner was Josh, the boat's greenhorn. The ''Cornelia Marie'' had a record-breaking season, catching over one million pounds of crab. The ''Northwestern'' packed her holds full of crab\u2014including dumping their entire sea water load to make more room for their last pots of crab\u2014and once again won the dollars earned title, but then busted a hydraulic line on their crane as they worked to restack their last pots. After offloading at Akutan, the ''Northwestern'' crew decided that greenhorn Jake had earned the boat jacket that was his goal for the season, and Captain Sig Hansen gave Jake the jacket off his back and finally gave him the long-overdue greeting and praise for his work, adding that the jacket didn't make Jake a man, but \"it does make you cool!\" The ''Northwestern'' returned to [[Puget Sound]] at the end of the opilio season and were greeted by happy family members.\n |LineColor=ACF16C\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Season 4 (2008) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#CC6CFF |overall=5 |season=5 |title=25 |airdate=20 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=35\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Get 'Em Back Safe!\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|15}}\n |ShortSummary=On the way to Dutch Harbor from [[Seattle, Washington]], the ''Wizard'' had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} hole torn into the hull after being hit by a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} rogue wave. Relief Captain Monte Colburn had a temporary patch put in place until the ''Wizard'' could be returned to a shipyard for permanent repairs. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son Scott joined the crew of the ''Time Bandit''. In addition to their usual load of supplies and fishing pots, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' loaded a rusted old truck as a practical joke for Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie''. Before the vessels departed for the start of the season, the captains met at the local watering hole to discuss the upcoming season and the ''Wizard's'' close call on the trip to Dutch Harbor. For this season's bet between the captains, whomever hauls in the highest average on a designated 25 pot string will win that week's wager of $100 per captain. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn decided to take on two greenhorns, Jason Moilanen and Lynn Guitard, instead of the usual one, as well as re-hiring last season's resilient greenhorn Crosby LeVeen, who is quick to express appreciation for no longer being the greenest hand on deck. On board the ''Northwestern'', Edgar Hansen oversaw repairs on a bent propeller shaft and bad bearings while the remaining crew members\u2014Norman Hansen, Nick Mavar, Matt Bradley, and returning greenhorn Jake Anderson\u2014stack pots and load gear, but the tension about losing precious fishing time to needed repairs causes the normally friendly group to snap at each other. In a repeat from his antics from the 2006 King crab season, Captain Phil's son Jake went on an unauthorized spending spree with Captain Phil's credit card and buys a [[Flat panel display|flat screen TV]], which does not go over well with Captain Phil. With five hours to go before the start of the season, the Hillstrands made the traditional call to their mother, but she tells them that she had a premonition that tragedy would strike the ''Time Bandit'' this season. The truck aboard the ''Time Bandit'' caused delays in setting their first pots of the seasons. Captain Keith Colburn being unable to follow his superstition about not having an empty [[Cup Noodles]] container to use as a [[spittoon]] delayed their start of the season. The repairs to the ''Northwestern'' prompted Captain Sig Hansen to dig into his archives and try a different strategy and fish further south than the rest of the fleet, but just as the boat is ready to push off from the dock and head out to sea, Captain Sig realizes Jake Anderson is missing. Sig decides to give the young deckhand \"two more minutes\" to return before heading out without him. Jake, whose goal this season is to become a full-share deckhand, races to the docks only to find the ''Northwestern'' has already started to pull away; however, Captain Sig spots him on the docks and maneuvers back to pick up his wayward deckhand (Captain Sig: \"You're lucky I can still back up to get you\u2014where were you?\" Jake: \"Making a phone call...to a girl.\" Captain Sig: \"That was almost a real expensive piece of {expletive}!\"). The ''Cornelia Marie's'' prospect strings come up nearly empty even though they were placed in normally reliable fishing grounds, leaving an already nervous and overstressed Captain Phil now reeling from the loss of his \"honey hole\".\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=36\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Striking Out\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|15}}\n |ShortSummary=A storm front forced the ''Northwestern'' to drop their pots {{convert|50|nmi|km}} short from their planned target in rough seas. The ''Time Bandit'' set their prank on Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' by replacing one of the ''Cornelia Marie's'' pots with the junk truck. When the crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled up the truck, they get a good laugh and then dump the truck overboard. Captain Phil called Captain Johnathan Hillstrand over the radio and gave him an \"A+\" for the prank. Captain Rick Fehst of the ''Early Dawn'' hurried to finish fishing for [[Brown box crab|brown king crab]] so that he could switch to red king crab. The vessel ended the season catching {{convert|784000|lb|kg}} of brown crab worth $1.9 million. The ''Wizard'' picked up another 150 pots from storage, which caused more work for the greenhorns and pushed Jason Moilanen to his breaking point. The ''Northwestern's'' gamble to fish further south did not work out and the crew pulled up nearly empty pots. After pulling up all of this pots, Captain Sig moved north to a different old family fishing grounds. He reminded Edgar Hansen of his ritual of biting the head off a [[herring]] for good luck and hoped following the ritual would bring better luck. The ''Time Bandit'' also had poor luck with their pots, pulling up few crabs per pot. The ''Wizard's'' plan to fish at the northern tip of the fishing grounds paid off with good prospect pots and they dropped their entire 150 pots.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=37\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=A Numbers Game\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|22}}\n |ShortSummary=The family fishing grounds produced results for the ''Time Bandit'' as they pulled an average of 60 keepers per pot for 12 hours. After 19 days of fishing, the ''Time Bandit'' was the first vessel to head to Dutch Harbor to offload. On the way back, greenhorn Scott Hillstrand contemplated his future as a fisherman. The ''Northwestern's'' traditional family ground also produced good results, but greenhorn Jake Anderson's sloppy crab counting angered Captain Sig Hansen. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen scolded the deck crew over not carrying an emergency knife should anybody get caught in a line. As punishment, he makes Jake wear a dead cod on his back. The ''Wizard'' was also on the crab with a string of 300 pots in a {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}} area. However, Captain Keith Colburn noticed that another fishing vessel had navigated a loop around one of his pots and pulled it up to sneak a look at his catch. Captain Keith's call to the suspect vessel went unanswered and he threatened the other captain to not mess with his equipment. Two weeks behind the rest of the fleet because of fishing for brown king crab, the ''Early Dawn'' tried to catch up by dropping 100 pots along a {{convert|50|nmi|km}} string, but this prospect line only pulled up a few cod per pot, causing a drop in morale on deck. After two weeks of poor fishing, staying awake for three straight days, and a 19-hour shift at the wheel, fatigue caught up with Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' and he fell asleep, causing the boat to miss two pots. After the crew wondered about two consecutive missed pots, they call up the wheelhouse and wake up Captain Phil. The picking hook's pulley breaks on the ''Northwestern'', which required Edgar to ride the crane up to replace the broken block. Mechanical problems also plagued the ''Wizard'' when a hydraulic line sprung a leak, but a patch was quickly installed by Engineer Lenny Lekonoff.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=38\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Unsafe and Unsound\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the ''Wizard'' worked a {{convert|9|nmi|km|adj=on}}, 55 pot string that Captain Keith Colburn called a \"man killer\". When greenhorn Jason Moilanen was not on deck for the start of the string, Captain Keith gave him some advice on how to cope with the long shifts. After three weeks of bad fishing and with 3 days to catch {{convert|88000|lb|kg}} of crab for a scheduled delivery, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' made radio calls to other captains to get some help on where to drop his pots, but received no answer. With no advice available, Captain Phil gambled on dropping a full load of pots in untested waters. Greenhorn Josh Harris and Deckhand Freddy Maugatai tried to change the boat's luck by shaving their heads into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], but the sacrifice proved ineffective and the ''Cornelia Marie'' continued to pull pots with low counts, and the stress of a bad season began to noticeably affect Phil's demeanor and already high stress levels. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen and Deck Boss Edgar Hansen challenged each other over who could stay awake the longest without breaking. Captain Sig finally offered a truce after he nodded off at the wheel after staying awake for over 47 hours; in response, Edgar led a celebration on deck: \"We broke the skipper!\". At Dutch Harbor for their first offload of the season, the ''Time Bandit'' lost a crew member when Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son, Scott, decided that family was more important to him than fishing and he left to fly home; Scott made the distinct point that Johnathan had been gone for almost all of Scott's childhood, and Scott wanted better for his own children, which wounded Johnathan's pride greatly. A flashback to three weeks earlier detailed a freak accident where Johnathan Hillstrand fell overboard while the ''Time Bandit'' was docked at Dutch Harbor. ''Time Bandit'' Deckhand Eddie Uwekoolani was taken to the emergency clinic where he was diagnosed with a chipped bone in his ankle that required a cast, requiring Johnathan to have to rotate Eddie to a position requiring less mobility while his boat was already a crewman down.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=39\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=No Mercy\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|6}}\n |ShortSummary=On board the ''Wizard'', the \"man killer\" strings continued to produce good numbers with an average of 90 crabs per pot. Captain Keith Colburn decided to push ahead and told his brother, Monte Colburn, to skip his turn at the wheel and go on the deck as soon as he woke up. This caused tension between the brothers and resulted in an argument over Monte's attitude bringing the morale of the deck crew down. In the end, the string filled the ''Wizard's'' hold with {{convert|183000|lb|kg}} of crab and the boat headed back for their first offload of the season. The ''Time Bandit'' finished her first offload of the season and headed on a 28-hour run to a string they left out while they offloaded. A quarter mile from the first pot, the [[Electrical ballast|ballast]] panel on their [[Sodium vapor lamp|sodium lights]] was ripped from the wall and caused a ship-wide power outage. The crew was able to repair the ballast and pick up their string, which had good numbers of crab. Also at Dutch Harbor, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' decided to delay the start of his second run due to his superstition about not leaving on Friday. The first string of the second run proved more productive that any string on the first run when the boat pulled in {{convert|34000|lb|kg}} of crab on this single string. Tensions on board the ''Northwestern'' came to a boil when greenhorn Jake Anderson and Deckhand Matt Bradley came to blows after Matt felt threatened by Jake's eagerness to learn new jobs on deck. On the ''Early Dawn'', Captain Rick Fehst instituted a 20-hour-on/4-hour-off work schedule after having several days of poor numbers. This took a toll on the deck crew, especially greenhorn Bryan Mezich, son of the boat's owner. After pulling up a string, Bryan took a turn at wheel watch in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|60|kn|0|adj=on}} seas while the rest of the crew went to sleep. Bryan dozed off after 10 minutes and the boat was jolted by a wave while he was asleep, waking the crew. An upset Captain Rick wanted to terminate Bryan for this infraction, but was overruled by Bryan's father and he was only given a $500 fine.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=40\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Racing The Clock\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|13}}\n |ShortSummary=After offloading {{convert|180000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $756,000, the ''Northwestern'' raced back to the fishing grounds in order to catch the remaining {{convert|19000|lb|kg}} of their quota in the nine days before their quoted price drops. Although they averaged 60 crab per pot, Captain Sig Hansen, concerned about the volume of crab, decided to follow his hunch and moved to different fishing grounds. The move turned out to be a poor one when the pots in the new territory produced low numbers of crab, causing the deck crew to grumble that they should not have moved. A pin broke in the picking hook pulley aboard the ''Time Bandit''. The broken pulley dropped a steel cable on deck, nearly hitting greenhorn Shea Long. After replacing the pulley, Deckhand Neal Hillstrand had to climb the mast to secure the safety chain to the boom; a task all the more difficult since the ''Time Bandit'' was in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. After low numbers caused low morale on the deck of the ''Early Dawn'', Engineer Mike Fish decided to give greenhorn Bryan Mezich a lesson in humility by letting Bryan tend the rail for the first 20 pots of a 300 pot string that had been soaking for 18 hours. Bryan's first attempts at throwing the hook were off the mark and Captain Rick Fehst put the boat into reverse, an insult to the hook thrower, after three failed attempts. Only after the sixth throw was Bryan able to hook the line. Despite the troubles picking up the first pot, the string proved to be a good one when the pots produced good numbers and the deck crew's morale rose as more crab were brought on board. Six weeks into the season and after convincing his father to allow him to fish for king crab, Captain Sten Skaar and the ''North American'' returned to Alaska after a three year hiatus. Captain Sten hired aboard Captain Erik Nyhammer of the ''Rollo'' (last seen in Season 2) as a deckhand and his crab fishing pots to make this return to king crab fishing. By using borrowed crab pots, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game only allowed Captain Sten two weeks to fish. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Wizard'' offloaded {{convert|183000|lb|kg}} of crab worth nearly $800,000. Before the crew headed back out, Captain Keith Colburn took the crew out for a drink and to pick up a [[Portable toilet|porta-potty]] in order to play a prank upon the ''North American''. In previous fishing seasons, the ''Wizard'' leased the ''North American's'' fishing quota and Captain Keith felt it necessary to play a prank upon Captain Sten when he took back his quota. Captain Keith hauled up one of the ''North American's'' pots and attached the porta-potty to it before dropping it back overboard. The ''North American'' pulled low numbers on their test pots and strings, but thought that their luck had changed after picking up the porta-potty prank. The full pots turned out to be full of female and juvenile crab, which must be returned to the sea, and only a few keepers were in each pot.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=41\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=Seeking the Catch\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|20}}\n |ShortSummary=Heavy seas, lack of proper equipment (no forward-facing sodium lights or crab sorting table), and the crew's inexperience from being away from king crab fishing for three years, made for difficult fishing on board the ''North American'' while it tried to catch {{convert|22000|lb|kg}} of crab to fill their tanks. Under pressure to catch their quota in a limited time, Deck Boss John Skaar's orders to launch pots faster caused conflict on deck when the rest of the crew became concerned that cutting corners was compromising crew safety. Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' decided to try his luck in an area, called the \"Slime Bank\" for the multitude of [[jellyfish]], that he had not fished in over 30 years, but the 60 pot string produced no crab and Captain Keith returned to more conventional fishing grounds. A repaired coiler broke again, forcing the crew to hand coil the lines, but they continued to pull up good numbers in the new fishing grounds. The ''Time Bandit's''' luck at fishing remote, seldom fished grounds was better when the boat brought up {{convert|35000|lb|kg}} of crab in 12 hours, led by perfect hook throwing by veteran deckhand Russell Newberry. When an injured [[cormorant]] landed on deck, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand took him in until the boat returned to Dutch Harbor where wildlife rescuers could tend to him, but the bird disappeared after the crew finished pulling the string. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew pulled up full pots, but the stress of fishing and a tight deadline for a changed offload date took its toll on Captain Phil Harris and he became ill, much to the concern of his oldest son, Josh. The ''Northwestern'' continued to grind through their pots in heavy seas. When greenhorn Jake Anderson hooked another boat's buoy, Deckhand Matt Bradley saved the day by making a [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary toss]] of the hook from the stern of the boat.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=42\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=No Season for Old Men\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|5|27}}\n |ShortSummary=After a quick offload, the ''Time Bandit'' headed back out to sea with Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's son, Scott, back on board after Andy Hillstrand had to return home to attend to personal business. Poor numbers narrowed the contenders for the final week of the Captain's wager made at the beginning of the season to just the ''Time Bandit'' and the ''Wizard''. Battling head-to-head up to the final pot, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' triumphed over Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' with a 75 crab per pot average versus a 65 crab per pot average, respectively. The crew of the ''Northwestern'' kept up their grinding schedule of 20 hour days for the past four weeks up until the very last pot. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen was hit in the head by the picking hook when the boat rolled in the waves and Greenhorn Jake Anderson was unable to grab the hook in time. However, Edgar shrugged off the injury and completed the traditional flaming hook toss to end the season. With 24 hours left in the season and {{convert|11000|lb|kg}} of their quota left to catch, the ''North American'' made a Hail Mary play by dropping their entire 100 pots into a small area after a test pot produced good results. The play worked out and the ''North American'' was able to catch their {{convert|83000|lb|kg}} quota in two weeks. On board the ''Early Dawn'', low numbers caused the crew to call the boat's owner to complain about the poor fishing with greenhorn and owner's son, Bryan Mezich, stating \"the crew prefers if you leased out quota\". The crew got their wish when the boat's owner called Captain Rick Fehst to tell him that the boat's final {{convert|75000|lb|kg}} of the season's quota had been leased out. The last string of the season for the ''Cornelia Marie'' was interrupted by a broken fitting on a hydraulic line on the crane. To repair the crane, Engineer Murray Gamrath had to climb the oil-slicked crane in a snow squall. With the King crab season over, the Hillstrand brothers gathered in their home port of [[Homer, Alaska]] to celebrate and to honor their deceased father, who is buried on a mountain slope overlooking the sea.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=43\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Storm Season\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|3}}\n |ShortSummary=The 2008 opilio crab season started with the ''Cornelia Marie'' returning after a main engine overhaul during the off season, the entire crew of the ''Northwestern'' suffering from the [[influenza|flu]] except for greenhorn Jake Anderson, and the usual change of captains on the ''Time Bandit'' from Johnathan Hillstrand to younger brother Andy Hillstrand. Johnathan's son Scott returned for the opilio season. The fleet left Dutch Harbor ahead of a storm, but the ''Wizard'' trailed behind because it had to refuel before heading out. The traditional biting off of the head of a herring on the ''Northwestern'' was done by deckhand Matt Bradley before Captain Sig Hansen dropped their crab pots on family fishing grounds. After an 8 hour soak and with Captain Andy contemplating a move after the first two strings of a test string produced poor results, the ''Time Bandit's'' third string produced good numbers. With the ''Wizard's'' late start to the season, the boat was forced to ride out {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} seas with a full stack of pots on deck until Captain Keith Colburn to drop 100 pots as soon as the boat reached the [[continental shelf]]. After the ''Wizard'' reached the normal opilio fishing grounds, a broken hydraulic system prevented the boat from dropping their remaining 150 pots. The ''North American'' broke in new greenhorn Darrell Labay to the ways of opilio crab fishing. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', an 8 hour soak on their 180 pots produced great numbers, but two engine warning lights on their newly overhauled engine forced the boat to return to Dutch Harbor. A United States Coast Guard HH-60J Jayhawk was dispatched from Air Station Kodiak to medevac a crewmember from the fish processing vessel ''Island Enterprise''. The helicopter was instructed to fly to [[Cold Bay, Alaska]] where a waiting plane was to take the patient to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], but poor weather conditions made the crew request an alternative flight plan.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=44\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Blow Up\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|10}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the Coast Guard helicopter, en route to Cold Bay with a patient rescued from the fish processing vessel ''Island Enterprise'', were unable to contact their command center. With the threat of ice and a quickly diminishing fuel supply, the pilots decided to change course and return to St. Paul. After a two-hour wait, a private cargo plane, took the patient to [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. The ''Cornelia Marie'' limped to the safety of Zolotoi Bay at St. Paul Island on her one good engine to ride out an approaching storm front. During the night, the strain on the ship caused a dangerous fray in the anchor line. Captain Phil Harris was forced to use his bad engine to help relieve the tension on the cable so that the crew can assess the damage. After a 36-hour run, the ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled into Dutch Harbor, where the crew quickly replaced the frayed anchor cable. The local engine mechanic was unable to determine the engine's problem. The ''Northwestern's'' first pots of the season were a blind drop due to approaching weather, but the boat got lucky and pulled up good numbers. After just 24 hours of working the area, the ''Northwestern'' filled its entire forward holding tank with {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} of crab. The ''Time Bandit'' worked a string of pots placed at the suggestion of Captain Johnathan Hillstrand. When the pots produced poor numbers, Captain Andy Hillstrand moved the ''Time Bandit'' to an old family fishing ground nicknamed \"[[Mr. Magoo]]\". After a long soak time for the pots, the crew hauled in massive numbers to the delight of Captain Andy. On board the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled pots containing large amounts of \"dirty\" crab (crab covered in barnacles), forcing the crew to throw away most of the catch. The low numbers and seeming lack of enthusiasm from the deck crew caused Captain Keith Colburn to lose his cool. Calling in the crew, he lectured them on how hard he has worked to make the ship successful and reprimanded each member for not giving enough effort. Later, after calming down, Captain Keith called in Lenny to apologize for his blow up. However, greenhorn Jason Moilanen, still fuming from the captain's criticism, confronts Captain Keith about how he was being treated, breaking the golden rule of crab fishing to never question the captain. Annoyed, Captain Keith orders him out.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=45\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Big Weather, Big Trouble\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|17}}\n |ShortSummary=An emergency weather warning about an approaching [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] was broadcast to the fleet. At Dutch Harbor, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' opted for the cheaper and easier band-aid repair to one of his engines in order to make it through the rest of the season and then headed back out to the fishing grounds. Heavy seas battered the crew of the ''Wizard''. On board the ''Northwestern'', the boat's crab processor called Captain Sig Hansen to tell him that they bumped the boat's delivery date up two days and wanted a larger delivery. Even though Captain Sig told the crew he would not have them pull two all nighters in a row, Captain Sig agreed to the new delivery date, forcing the crew to work through a second night. The tired crew made a near deadly mistake when they did not dog down a pot on the launcher and it slid off, pinning greenhorn Jake Anderson against the sorting table. Quick work by the crew freed Jake before he was crushed by the {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} pot. On the ''Time Bandit'', Johnathan Hillstrand decided to go out on the deck to work a string before the hurricane hit. While throwing an underhanded toss of the hook, Johnathan missed and the hook hit him in the face, opening a small cut above his nose. In between a run to test pots, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' confronted his son Jake over Jake's work ethic. Just on the edge of the hurricane, the boat fished in {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|100|kn|0|adj=on}} seas, pulling up an average of 800 keepers per pot. But worsening weather forced Captain Phil to quickly dump the rest of his pots and run for cover. After 35 straight hours of fishing, the ''Northwestern'' succeeded in filling all of the boat's tanks in time to make their new delivery deadline.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=46\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=Mortal Men\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|6|24}}\n |ShortSummary=Three arctic storms converged on the fishing grounds, causing severe damage to many of the boats. The crews raced to repair their boats as another severe storm approached. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris injured his ribs after being thrown from his bunk during the storm. After bandaging his ribs, Captain Phil went to the wheelhouse to continue fishing for the remaining {{convert|34000|lb|kg}} for the scheduled delivery. The crew hauled in good numbers, but Captain Phil's condition began to worsen as he started to cough up blood. Captain Phil decided to keep this a secret from the crew. On the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled in big numbers and Captain Keith Colburn decided to set back the gear in the same spot. This required the crew to step up the pace of work, but greenhorn Jason Moilanen continued to underperform. Deciding that they have had enough of Jason Moilanen, Captain Keith called his brother, Monte, to the wheelhouse to conduct interviews for a new greenhorn and decided to hire Cooper Weatherby. As the ''Time Bandit'' offloaded {{convert|135000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $220,000 at St. Paul Island, Co-Captains Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand decided to reward younger brother Neal for his many years of service by telling him he was no longer required to work on the deck. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil called Engineer Murray Gamrath and confided in him about his condition, worried that he may have an internal injury. Despite some medical attention by Murray, Phil's condition did not improve and Captain Phil called an Anchorage hospital, which recommended that he seek immediate medical attention. Captain Phil decided to ignore the recommendation and continue fishing. Unable to keep Captain Phil's condition a secret any longer, Murray disobeyed orders and told Captain Phil's sons about their dad's condition. Captain Phil's son, Josh, attempted to convince him to head into port and get medical help. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' called Captain Phil seeking advice on fishing, but instead talked about Captain Phil's condition and Captain Keith repeated the recommendation to seek medical attention. Murray's concern led him to tell series producer Todd Stanley to watch over Captain Phil in the wheelhouse and to call him if Captain Phil's condition worsened. Two days after his injury, Captain Phil conceded that his condition was not getting any better and agreed with the crew to head to St. Paul after the gear was set. When the ''Cornelia Marie'' arrived at St. Paul, a storm surge prevented the boat from entering port and they were forced to circle the island. News of Captain Phil's condition spread throughout the fleet. Other captains attempted to call Captain Phil, but he chose to ignore the calls. Sixty hours after his injury, the storm broke and the ''Cornelia Marie'' was able to enter the harbor at St. Paul. A series of [[X-ray]]s suggested that Captain Phil's condition was more severe than broken ribs and a possible puncture lung and that he required examination by a specialist. \n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=47\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=Fresh Blood\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|1}}\n |ShortSummary=After one last cigarette, Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' checked himself into the [[emergency room]] at [[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] at 3:00&nbsp;am. The ''Northwestern's'' crew attempted to retrieve the ship's anchor after it snapped off in a storm the night before. Using a [[jury rig]]ged drag hook, the crew attempted to secure the heavy anchor chain, but the ship began to drift in the strong current, which caused the ''Northwestern'' to list dangerously to the side. After four tense hours, the crew finally recovered the anchor. The ''Time Bandit'' pulled into St. Paul Island to pick up new greenhorn Earon Overson. Later as the crew began pulling in their next string of pots, senior Deckhand Russell Newberry taught the new greenhorn how to work on deck and sort crab. With offloading complete, the ''Cornelia Marie'' set off with Engineer Murray Gamrath as relief captain and a new greenhorn, Dan Decker. On their way to Dutch Harbor to offload, a pipe that feeds the after crab tank with fresh water burst on the ''Wizard''. The crew worked together to patch the pipe before it could flood the engine room. After working their first string without Captain Phil Harris aboard and with the crew asleep, Relief Captain Murray called Captain Phil to check on his status. Captain Phil told Murry that he was diagnosed with a [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] that came loose in his leg and traveled up through his heart into his lung, [[Pulmonary Embolism|a condition]] the doctors say could have killed him. At Dutch Harbor, after a slow offload, the crew of the ''North American'' spent a day repairing the extensive damage to the aft deck caused by a rough wave three days earlier. Back at sea, Captain Sten Skaar let greenhorn Darrell Labay work the rail, but the rest of the crew questioned the captains decision on letting an inexperienced crew member work the rail. When Darrell could not keep up, the crew continued to lose respect for him. On board the ''Time Bandit'', their greenhorn Earon's work improved, though he battled sea sickness. After reaching Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn fired greenhorn Jason Moilanen for breaking the cardinal rule aboard ship of never questioning the captain of the boat. The Colburn brothers welcomed Jason's replacement, Cooper Weatherby aboard, who brought along a gift of two Cup Noodles for Captain Keith.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=48\n |EpisodeNumber2=14\n |Title=Changing Tides\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|8}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' offloaded {{convert|184000|lb|kg}} of crab at St. Paul Island, but the growing ice in the harbor made leaving the dock difficult. Captain Sig Hansen wanted to reach his northernmost pots before the rapidly approaching ice pack covered them up. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Wizard'' completed their offload of {{convert|407000|lb|kg}} of crab and headed back to sea. But the trip started on a sour note when Captain Keith Colburn's brother Monte argued with him over relief duties at the wheelhouse. The ''Time Bandit'' worked their fishing ground nicknamed \"Mr. Magoo\" for three straight days, pulling up nearly {{convert|270000|lb|kg}} of crab. With Engineer Neal Hillstrand retired from working the deck, Scott Hillstrand took over operating the hydraulics. Scott's inexperience at the controls made for slower work and he made a rookie mistake when he did not properly dog down a crab pot to the launcher, causing the pot to tip over on deck, nearly hitting a crew member. During one of his morning check-ins with his father, Josh Harris heard Captain Phil question his future as a fishing boat captain. The news lowered morale aboard the boat, but the crew pulled together for a 36-hour shift to pull up 200 crab pots. The ''Northwestern'' reached their pots ahead of the ice pack and after eight hours of pulling pots and breaking ice, the crew managed to retrieve 65 of their 130 pots and pulled in {{convert|45000|lb|kg}} of crab. With an average of 750 keepers per pot, Captain Sig Hansen regretted having to leave the spot after getting everything dialed in, but the danger of losing pots to the ice pack was too great. After the Colburn brothers patched things up between them and the new greenhorn oriented to the ways of the deck, the crew of the ''Wizard'' resumed fishing, but pulled up blanks. On board the ''Time Bandit'', the crew finished up a 72 hour grind, though several pots had to be rail dumped because they contained only female and juvenile crab, which can not be legally fished. With larger swells rolling in, Co-captains Johnathan and Andy Hillstrand went on deck to observe Scott Hillstrand work the hydraulics. When the boat took a roll, Scott lost control of a crab pot and it nearly crushed greenhorn Earon Overson's skull. The ''Cornelia Marie'' pulled in {{convert|120000|lb|kg}} of crab after 72 hours of steady fishing. As a reward for making it through his second 36-hour shift, Deckhand Freddie Maughtai let greenhorn Dan Decker throw the crab hook for the first time.\n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=49\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Catch as Catch Can\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|15}}\n |ShortSummary=On board the ''Wizard'', the crew pulled up full pots after letting them soak at new fishing grounds for 27 hours. After 36 hours of work, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' finished rescuing their pots ahead of the approaching ice pack. After relocating the pots to safer grounds, Captain Sig Hansen was again on the crab and the boat pulled in good numbers. When a pot was being hauled on deck, a broken bridle on the pot nearly caused Deckhand Nick Mavar Jr. to have his foot caught in the line as the pot descended back to the ocean floor. Quick work by Deck Boss Edgar Hansen saved the pot when he tossed the slack line overboard and put the tail of the line back into the block. Relief Captain Murray Gamrath decided to strengthen the deck crew by hiring aboard Mark Anderson, who had been away from the fleet for over a year after an off season fall. Mark was put to work at the controls of the hydraulics, but the hiatus made him a little rusty at the controls and he caused a pot to swing out of control as it was being pulled on deck. Fishing on untested grounds and with 36 hours to catch {{convert|190000|lb|kg}} of crab, Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' planned to push his crew through a four-day grind until the boat was full. An unexpected wave while pulling a pot caused the line to jump free of the block and to go up over Deckhand Shea Long's head and behind his back, but a quick reaction from him prevented him from being injured by the line. After a 30-hour steam, the ''North American'' arrived at Dutch Harbor for their final offload of {{convert|150000|lb|kg}} of crab. After consulting with the crew, Captain Sten Skaar decided to let go of greenhorn Darrell Labay before the start of the new crab season. Mediocre fishing caused the ''Wizard'' to struggle to fill their last crab tank, which caused the deck crew's morale to drop and tension between greenhorns Lynn Guitard and Cooper Weatherby. \n |LineColor=CC6CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=50\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=The Final Hour\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|7|22}}\n |ShortSummary=With {{convert|145000|lb|kg}} crab left to catch, Relief Captain Murray Gamrath of the ''Cornelia Marie'' received a call about the boat's offload date. With an earlier than expected offload date and cold weather nearly shutting down fishing, the crew hurries to pick up their last pots of the season. In between a 4 hour run to the ''Northwestern's'' last string of the season, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen decided to make a \"deck dummy\" dressed as a crew member to throw off the top of the wheelhouse as a prank against Captain Sig Hansen, but his plan was interrupted when the boat arrived at the string. On the ''Wizard'', the crew spent the last 36 hours, 135 pots, and 70,000 keepers trying to fill the port aft tank, but it continued to take in more crab until the very last pot of the season when it finally appeared to top off. The crew celebrated the end of their season, but unknown to them, the tank once again appeared to settle and was no longer full. On board the ''Northwestern'', the crew did the traditional flaming hook for the last toss of the season. With the last pot pulled in, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen put his prank plan into action, but was foiled when Captain Sig noticed that the deck dummy's legs were crooked and it could not have been a real crew member. The crew of the ''Cornelia Marie'' worked through various injuries to pick up their last 180 pots for {{convert|95000|lb|kg}} of crab and headed to Dutch Harbor to offload. Back home outside of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Captain Phil Harris continued his recovery from the blood clot and contemplated his future as a fishing boat captain. The ''Time Bandit'' finished up a 42-hour grind to finish the season and headed to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Andy Hillstrand let greenhorn Earon Overson toss the last hook of the season as his hard work gained the respect of the crew. At St. Paul Island, the ''Wizard'' offloaded {{convert|425000|lb|kg}} of crab. After the port aft tank was emptied, Deck Boss Gary Soper discovered the reason for the apparently bottomless tank; a hole opened up towards the top of the tank, letting crab escape back into the sea. Back at Dutch Harbor, Deckhand Shea Long of the ''Time Bandit'' was unhappy with the prospect of Scott Hillstrand taking over the boat. Jake and Josh Harris reunited with their father in Seattle and Captain Phil discussed the seriousness of his illness and his future as captain. As an epilogue to the season, it was noted that on March 23, 2008, two weeks after the crab season ended, the fish processing vessel ''[[FV Alaska Ranger|Alaska Ranger]]'' took on water and sank, forcing the 47 crew members to enter the water. 42 crew members were rescued by the United States Coast Guard and the sister ship ''Alaska Warrior''.

Captain Phil Harris returns to the bridge of the ''Cornelia Marie'' after being away for eight months, but then immediately spends $5,000 on new bait sacks after Jake and Josh lost the sacks from the previous season. The captains gather at the traditional burn barrel and bar where they make the year's captain's wager for $4,000. This year's wager is for the most keepers caught from five specially designated captain's pots. On the ''Time Bandit'', the Hillstrands re-hire deckhand Mike Fourtner, who has aspirations of running the boat when the Hillstrand brothers retire. The Hillstrands play a prank on him as a welcome back by dumping two bins full of water and flour on him. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith receives a call from his doctor that the biopsy came back negative for cancer, but positive for [[epithelial dysplasia]]. During the traditional blessing of the fleet, Captain Phil receives a call from his doctor that the blood clot condition has not completely healed. Reluctantly, Phil decides he must relinquish the captain's chair to Murray Gamrath. The ''Time Bandit'' is the first to reach the southern crab grounds where Captain Johnathan drops two 10-pot prospect pots in a spot that was productive last year. Just as the ''Wizard'' is to drop her first pots of the season, Captain Keith's wife calls with news that the $400,000 in repairs during the off-season has drained his bank account leaving him with a zero balance. The prospect pots return nearly empty and Captain Keith decides to move on. On the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen draws the [[Drawing straws|short straw]], though actually a short [[zip tie]], to do the traditional biting off the head of a herring. On the ''Wizard'', a pot is lost when the line snaps. Captain Keith suspects a jagged edge of [[zinc]] [[anode]] is cutting the lines, and the only way to be sure is for Captain Keith to dive under the boat or return to port. Captain Keith made the decision to do the risky dive, but as he is ascending from under the boat, the boat rolls; he sustains a head injury, and has to be lifted back aboard in a life sling. Last year's hot spot for the ''Time Bandit'' is just as hot this year when the first pot of the prospect string hauls in 96 keepers; seeing such great results, Captain Johnathan blankets area with all of his pots.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=52\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Red Skies in the Morning\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|4|21}}\n |ShortSummary=The crew of the ''Wizard'' tends to Captain Keith Colburn, but it is too early to tell if he is seriously injured from bumping his head on the underside of the boat. After another test string results in a full pot, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' drops his entire load of pots in the hot spot from last season. After getting eight hours of sleep, On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith takes over the helm even though he does not remember most of what happened during his accident. The skippers notice the [[Weather lore#Red sky at night|red sky in the morning]] and the leading edge of a monster storm reaches the fleet at 10:00 AM with the ''Northwestern'' getting hit first. Her crew continues to fish through the leading edge of the storm, when Captain Sig Hansen's wife calls with a weather report of approaching {{convert|40|kn|0|adj=on}} plus winds from the east. Captain Sig decides to push as hard as he can before the storm hits. The ''Time Bandit'' consolidates her entire 197 pot load in a {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area. Relief Captain Murray Gamrath steers the ''Cornelia Marie'' to pick up a {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} long string of 90 pots after a 48-hour soak, but instead of the 60 average keepers he was expecting, he gets only a few crab per pot. With such low numbers, Captain Murray orders the crew to stack the gear and heads off to a second string {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the north. He also receives a phone call from Captain Phil Harris asking him how the fishing is going and providing Captain Murray with a report that Captain Johnathan of the ''Time Bandit'' was averaging 80 to 90 keepers per pot. On board the ''Northwestern'', a broken pot catches the line while being dropped overboard, causing two pots to get tangled, but the crew slowly works to clear the problem. The ''Cornelia Marie'' hits the southern edge of the storm and where 60 pots were dropped to the north, but while the pots look good at first, most of the crab are females or juveniles. The crew grumbles about the lack of crab and Captain Murray has no plan on where to go next. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to pull up good numbers, filling up their tanks with nearly {{convert|30000|lb|kg}} of crab, but the 36-hour grind causes the tension to rise between Mike Fourtner and Russell Newberry.

Facing the worst of the storm, the ''Wizard'' is low on fresh bait and pulls a string of cod pots in {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|75|mph|km/h|adj=on}} ([[Beaufort scale|Force 12]]) seas. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen keeps news of the ''Katmai'' tragedy from the crew. After going 36 hours without sleep, Captain Sig hands over the helm to Deck Boss Edgar Hansen and he steers the ''Northwestern'' on setting a string. After a 27-hour soak, the string pulls up good numbers, lifting the spirits of the crew. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Deck Hand Corey Eisenbarth recounts his experience when he was a greenhorn aboard a fishing vessel that went down 26 years ago.

On board the ''Wizard'', Monte Colburn is upset that Greenhorn Josh Warner had posted a picture of him and his girlfriend near the bait station. Monte smears bait over the photo, which prompts Josh to leave the deck and complain to Captain Keith Colburn about the issue, but he receives no sympathy and is told to get back to work. Captain Wade Henley and the ''Lisa Marie'' arrives at the southern end of the fishing grounds two weeks after the rest of the fleet because she was fishing for cod for a month. The smallest boat in the fleet at {{convert|78|ft|m}} long can only carry 40 pots, which she drops overboard for a prospect string. On the ''Northwestern'', steady but mediocre numbers make Captain Sig Hansen happy, but his mode changes when the cannery calls to tell him that they have moved his delivered day up a day, leaving less than 72 hours to catch {{convert|50000|lb|kg}} of crab. His mood continues to darken when the fatigue of the deck crew, who have been working for 17 hours non-stop, causes them to slow down and make mistakes. The ''Time Bandit'' pull up a 75 pot string with low numbers putting their push to fill their quota in time for delivery in jeopardy, but two large pots push them over their {{convert|117000|lb|kg|adj=on}} full load and they head back to port. On their way to pick a cod fishing string, Deckhand Jake Anderson of the ''Northwestern'' receives permission from the crew and Captain Sig to man the hydraulics for the first time. When Captain Sig comes out of the wheelhouse to caution Jake about going too fast, Edgar Hansen becomes unhappy about Captain Sig stepping across the line of responsibility from the wheelhouse to the deck. After dropping her 40 pots overboard, the ''Lisa Marie'' anchors at [[Amak Island]] to take cover from the storm where she is joined by the ''Cornelia Marie''. Captain Murray Gamrath of the ''Cornelia Marie'' is relieved from the wheelhouse after being on duty for 39 hours straight. Deckhand Corey Eisenbarth notices that the boat is drifting due to the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} swells and {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} winds and wakes up Captain Murray so that he can captain the boat while they pull up the anchor. The anchor line gets caught on the outside of the pulley.

The crew gets a reminder on complacency when a rogue wave knocks a pot off the launcher, nearly crashing into Deckhand Russell Newberry before it goes over the side. After seven days of fishing on barren grounds, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' makes a major move by baiting heavy and moving to new fishing grounds, but his plans are delayed when he discovers that the boat is low on bait. Captain Keith decides to call out to Captain Sig Hansen of the ''Northwestern'' to ask for bait, hoping that Captain Sig follows the unwritten rule of \"whenever somebody needs help, regardless of who it is and what is, you help them out\". Continuing to haul up low numbers and with only {{convert|150000|lb|kg}} out of {{convert|200000|lb|kg}} for a full load, Captain Murray Gamrath calls the crew to the wheelhouse that he is going to take the ''Cornelia Marie'' up north {{convert|80|to|95|mi|km}} in search of better numbers. Despite their low numbers, Captain Sig of the ''Northwestern'' decides to not move and stick it out. Deck Boss Edgar Hansen calls out Deckhand Jake Anderson about how he is prepping the crab pots. Jake takes the criticism personally and his attitude annoys Edgar. The ''Time Bandit'' offloads {{convert|121000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $609,000 at Saint Paul. Also experiencing miserable fishing, Captain Wade Henley considers moving the ''Lisa Marie'' up north, but the boat's small deck would mean multiple trips which would eat up fishing time. Captain Wade decides to move up north {{convert|50|mi|km}} instead of {{convert|80|mi|km}} where he was told over the radio that there was good fishing. Later that night, the crew pulls up a test pot after a 7 hour soak that results in no crab. The lack good fishing causes tension among the crew to rise, culminating in Deckhand Robert Christensen shoving his brother Greenhorn David Christensen to the deck after Robert's toss of the hook gets caught in a shot line that David was coiling. Working on an 80 pot string with two days before having to make a delivery and on a 36-hour grind, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' gets careless. Jake Anderson handles the crab roughly on the sorting table, causing Edgar to call out Jake once again. When Deckhand Matt Bradley joins in on calling out Jake, tempers flare between the two. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew drops 141 pots on new grounds. Tensions are also high among the Harris brothers, with Jake and Josh arguing over Josh's filling of the bait jars. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to pull up full pots. Another close call on deck happens when a bridle breaks while pulling up a pot, but a quick reaction by Deckhand Mike Fourtner to throw out the line from the coiler prevents anybody from getting caught in the line and pulled overboard. Mike's luck doesn't hold when he loses two hooks overboard. The crew manage to retrieve the second hook with some luck and jury rigged hook made of two shackles. With only {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} of bait on board, Captain Keith leaves his brother Monte Colburn at the helm while on a run to pick up some cod pots. Monte spots a herd of [[walrus]] and Keith is upset that Monte did not wake him as the superstitious Keith sees the walrus as a good omen. Keith drops a string of pots exactly where the walrus herd was spotted. After a 24-hour soak, the walrus herd turns out to indeed be a good omen as the crab pots are full and the ''Wizard'' fills her tanks full. The ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s move {{convert|100|mi|km}} north does not turn out when she pulls up a disappointing string of pots.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=56\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Deadline \n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Wizard'' is being helmed by Monte Colburn as she fishes in {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, {{convert|100000|lb|kg}} short of her quota. At first pots in the string are full, but the count quickly drops off. The ''Northwestern'' drops 86 pots on a third string in new fishing grounds. As she heads back to the other end of the grounds, Deck Boss Edgar Hansen needles Deckhand Jake Anderson, which upsets him. The bad feelings chill when a wave crashes on deck, hits Edgar and Jake, and knocking Edgar off his feet. The ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s bad luck continues when she only gets 45 keepers out of 25 pots. Hoping to change their luck, Deckhands Josh Harris, Jake Harris, and Freddy Maugatai try their new tradition of shaving their heads into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]. After pulling up mediocre numbers for the past three days, the ''Time Bandit'' heads to their last string of the season. The string starts off good, pulls up a blank on the third pot, but the last few pots have good numbers, allowing the crew to meet their quota of {{convert|270000|lb|kg}} of crab. Captain Johnathan Hillstrands plots a course back to Dutch Harbor to offload. On board the ''Lisa Marie'', crew morale sinks when a string after a 20 hour soak pulls up mostly female crab. The crew must stack and move their 60 pots for the third time in two weeks. Deck Boss Robert Christensen berates Deckhand Brandon Williams. Brandon then goes to Captain Wade Henley to tell him that this will be his last trip on the boat because he feels that he is not getting the respect that he deserves. After the mediocre numbers that Monte Colburn picked up through the storm, Captain Keith Colburn packs five strings in a {{convert|2|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area back where he saw the herd of walruses. The plan works out when the crew pulls of pots with large numbers of crab. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Time Bandit'' offloads her catch. Captain Johnathan has caught over $1.7 million worth of crab. The crew celebrate the end of the king crab season by smashing several whipped cream pies in the face of Andy Hillstrand, who will be captain during the upcoming opilio crab season.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=57\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=Down to the Wire \n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|5|26}}\n |ShortSummary=The final week of the king crab season sees the crew of the ''Wizard'' pushing to pull up their last 20 pots of the season. They get good numbers of keepers and head to Dutch Harbor to offload. On board the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen is radio fishing in English and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but Deck Boss Edgar Hansen is skeptical of any advice received over the radio. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is finally on the crab, but their long trip makes Relief Captain Murray Gamrath worry that the crab in the tanks might be towards the end of how long they can survive. Deckhand Jake Harris has an injured back, but when brother Josh tries to help out, Josh ends up injuring Jake's pride and they argue over their duties on deck. The brother soon make up when the boat averages 30 keepers per pot. With {{convert|200000|lb|kg}} in their tanks, the ''Cornelia Marie'' begins the 30-hour trip back to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Sig on the ''Northwestern'' makes a gamble by dropping three 50-pot \"[[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]]\" strings on the radio information he received, but the pots bring up lousy numbers and the crew has to continue to grind through the season. With their season completed before the other boats, the Hillstrand brothers of the ''Time Bandit'' go fishing in [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas|San Carlos, Mexico]]. Just outside Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' calls Greenhorn Josh Warner up to the wheelhouse to congratulate him on a good job during the season and to offer him a job during the upcoming opilio season. First Mate Gary Soper initiates Josh to the crew by playing a practical joke on him. As the ''Wizard'' is being offloaded, Engineer Lenny Lekanoff surprises the Colburn brothers by telling them that he is retiring after fishing for 25 years. The ''Northwestern'' picks up their last \"Hail Mary\" string and the crew celebrates by shooting off fireworks, but Captain Sig is worried that the Coast Guard will interpret the fireworks as [[Flare|signal flares]]. At Dutch Harbor, the ''Cornelia Marie'' offloads their crab. The crew is dismayed to find a lot of dead loss due to the boat being out too long. The crew makes one final trip out to dump the dead loss over the side. Captain Sig of the ''Northwestern'' barely makes his delivery deadline and the cannery haggles with him over the price of the crab. Two weeks after the season ends, the captains gather to settle the Captain's Wager. The wager comes down to a single pot between the ''Time Bandit'' and the ''Wizard'', with the ''Time Bandit'' winning. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand splits the winnings with the crew.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=58\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=Payback Time\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|2}}\n |ShortSummary=The beginning of the 2009 opilio season is greeted by an ice storm in Dutch Harbor. On the way to the fuel dock, the ''Wizard'' loses power and drifts east of [[Hog Island (Aleutian Islands)|Hog Island]]. She regains power before drifting into the rocks of Hog Island and heads back to her dock to diagnose the problem with her fuel system. Captain Phil Harris returns to the helm of the ''Cornelia Marie'' after an 11 month break from fishing due to this [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] from last season. The ice storm has delayed Captain Sig Hansen's, of the ''Northwestern'', arrival at Dutch Harbor for two days. Before the start of the king crab season, Deckhand Jake Anderson of the ''Northwestern'' pulled a prank on Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' by stealing Captain Johnathan's signature U.S.A jacket. The Hillstrand brothers seek revenge upon Jake at the start of the opilio season. Jake decides to spare the crew of the ''Northwestern'' from possible retaliation by going on board the ''Time Bandit'' to return the jacket. However, the Hillstrand brothers still decide to punish Jake by taping him to the ''Time Bandit''{{'}}s crane and dipping him waist-deep into the sea. The weather clears enough for Captain Sig to fly into Dutch Harbor on the day that the opilio season starts. Captain Sig and Captain Andy Hillstrand visit Captain Phil on the ''Cornelia Marie'' to discuss the ice situation on the fishing grounds. Captain Phil hires mechanic Jeff Whited to check over the ''Cornelia Marie''. He finds a leak in the fuel tank that needs immediate repair in a [[drydock]]. While drydocked, a problem with the propeller is discovered. Steve Ward replaces Murray Gamrath as engineer after Murray decides to retire from fishing. Steve finds a water leak in the hydraulic system that needs repair. The three repairs total up to a $100,000 bill. With the impending ice storm, the captains of the ''Northwestern'' and ''Time Bandit'' decide to offload some pots to make for a safer boat and then head off to the fishing grounds. The ''Wizard''{{'}}s loss of power is traced back to a leak in the fuel tank. The tank is drained and ventilated to allow Monte Colburn to weld the leak as a temporary fix to get the boat through the opilio season. Instead of taking off pots like the ''Northwestern'' and ''Time Bandit'', Captain Keith Colburn decides to take a full load of 235 pots and rig up a tarp across the front of the stack to prevent freezing spray from building up on the stack. The ''Time Bandit'' arrives at the same fishing spot in the northern area of the fishing grounds as last season and drops her first strings. Captain Andy has four days until his delivery date to fill the boat and wants to launch his pots as fast as possible. The Hillstrands hire on new Deckhand Jon Jorgenson even though they still need to cut one crew member at the end of the season. The extra hire means that six crew members are competing for five spots. The ''Northwestern'' drops her pots further north than the ''Time Bandit''. Deckhand Jake Anderson does the traditional biting off of the head of a herring to start the season. Captain Sig drops three 40-pot strings just {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of the ice and hopes that the ice does not cover his pots before he can retrieve them. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' decides that 235 pots is too many and departs Dutch Harbor with 225 pots. After three days in drydock, the repairs on the ''Cornelia Marie'' are complete and she heads off, but not before Captain Phil decides to give his son Josh a full share. Brothers Jake and Josh Harris argue while they load the pots onto the deck. After a nine-hour soak, the ''Time Bandit''{{'}}s first string pulls up low numbers, which forces Captain Andy to scramble for a new plan before the ice arrives at the fishing grounds in two days. The ''Cornelia Marie'' arrives at the fishing grounds with Captain Phil planning to fish near the ice pack. In {{convert|50|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, the crew of the ''Wizard'' works on the bow of the ship to lash down the tarp. Captain Keith calls for an abort of the work, but the crew does not hear him and the boat takes a big wave which engulfs the crew.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=59\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=No Second Chances\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|9}}\n |ShortSummary=Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' calls to his crew on the bow after a big wave crashes over the bow engulfing the crew. After not hearing anything, Captain Keith rushes down from the wheelhouse to find that Monte Colburn has injured ribs from being thrown against the drag anchor, Deckhand Lynn Guitard with a contusion above his left eye and lower back, and First Mate Gary Soper with a contusion below his left eye. With half the crew injured, the ''Wizard'' turns back to Dutch Harbor. The Hillstand family fishing ground nicknamed \"[[Mr. Magoo]]\" does not produce any crab unlike last season. The crew of the ''Time Bandit'' rail dumps the pots dropped on \"Mr. Magoo\" and head to their northern strings {{convert|60|mi|km}} away. After offloading {{convert|152000|lb|kg}} worth $258,000, the ''Incentive'' is fishing on the southern fishing grounds {{convert|80|mi|km}} from the sea ice in the middle of an arctic squall with {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} seas, {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} gusts, and {{convert|-10|F|C}} temperatures. While pulling up full pots after 18 hours of work, a pot slips from the launcher, but the crew avoids injury. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' agonizes over his decision to send his crew out on the bow. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil Harris plans a short soak strategy in order to beat the ice. With two new crew members on deck, the crew has yet to get into a good rhythm. When new Engineer Steve Ward is slow stacking the pots on the deck, the Harris sons push him to work faster. This results in a dressing down by Captain Phil to his sons about working together. With three days to go until their delivery date, the ''Time Bandit'' arrives at their northern family fishing ground nicknamed \"butt cheeks\". Trying to break their bad luck, the crew set fire to the Jake Anderson, of the ''Northwestern'', dummy they made when paying Jake back for stealing Captain Johnathan Hillstrand's jacket. The crew's luck changes as the crew pulls up three-quarter full pots after a 21-hour soak. Captain Andy Hillstrand decides to concentrate all of his gear on the \"butt cheeks\" fishing grounds. The ''Northwestern'' is on the crab, pulling an average of 400 keepers per pot {{convert|55|mi|km|adj=on}} from the sea ice. A {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} wave crashes over the port side of the boat, snapping the pot tie downs at the stern of the boat, causing the pots to shift to the starboard side. On board the ''Cornelia Marie'', the crew finally gets into a rhythm and their short soaked pots pull up good numbers. Captain Phil must decide on whether to stay and fish and risk being caught by the ice or make a run to St. Paul to offload while the weather is clear. While launching a pot, Jake Harris gets his leg caught in the line after it pops free from the block. Quick work by his brother, Josh Harris, frees Jake's leg before the descending pot pulls him overboard. After a 20 hour steam, the ''Wizard'' arrives back at Dutch Harbor and the injured crew receive medical attention.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=60\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Sea of Misery\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|16}}\n |ShortSummary=Six hours after offloading $352,000 worth of crab, the ''Northwestern'' is hauling up a 100-pot string after a 48-hour soak. The ice pack has moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} south in the past 36 hours, putting the ice {{convert|40|mi|km}} away from the ''Northwestern''{{'}}s northern strings. The crew rush through hauling up the southern string before moving {{convert|15|mi|km}} to haul the northern strings. Captain Sig Hansen has the ''Northwestern'' on the crab, getting an average of 500\u2013600 crab per pot, and wants to move west {{convert|.75|mi|km}} before resetting the pots to keep the fishing fresh and ahead of the crab, but the crew questions Captain Sig's decision not to set back on the same spot like previous seasons. Still docked at Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' has second thoughts about his decision making process regarding the accident that injured three of his crewmembers. The boat heads out with a full crew with retired Engineer Lenny Lekanoff and injured First Mate Gary Soper rejoin the crew. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is picking up the last 120 pots of her northern string, getting 500 keepers per pot, when Captain Phil Harris receives a radio report of an approaching storm with {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. Captain Phil puts the crew into overdrive to finish picking up the string and head to St. Paul for offload before the storm arrives. The ''Time Bandit'' arrives at St. Paul an hour ahead of her scheduled delivery time with approximately {{convert|90000|lb|kg}} of crab on board. The tired deck crew hits their racks during offload, but nobody is assigned to take notes of the offload to check the cannery's numbers. The cannery reports that they have taken off {{convert|85000|lb|kg}} of crab and the crew can not confirm that the cannery is short two brailers. The discrepancy and lack of attention earns the crew a dressing down by Captain Andy Hillstrand. The ''Wizard'' finally drops the first pots of her season on the southern end of the fishing ground. Captain Keith notices that the ''Northwestern'' and several [[Trident Seafoods]] boats are in the area and he becomes concerned that he may be dropping on areas that have been fished out. While steaming for an hour to their northern strings, the ''Northwestern'' builds up {{convert|6|in|cm}} of ice on her deck and the crew spend the next four hours breaking ice. The ''Wizard'' crew offload their 204 pots in {{convert|60|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} seas. Captain Keith is still having doubts on the decision to fish and his confidence is shattered when Lenny is knocked off his feet by a wave. Even though Lenny is okay, Captain Keith calls off launching of the remaining pots on deck. The ''Time Bandit'' crew pick up right where they left off when their first string of their second trip of the season averages more than 700 keepers per pot. {{convert|10|mi|km}} out from St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie'' is inching her way through the sea ice. Below decks, Engineer Steve Ward notices a small leak in the port crab tank circulation pipe. While grinding away the rust around the leak to attempt a repair, the leak grows bigger, setting off alarms. The crew, who had been asleep on the run to St. Paul, wakes up and heads below to help Steve apply a temporary patch to the pipe.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=61\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Lockout\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|23}}\n |ShortSummary=Working three consecutive 30-hour shifts, the crew of the ''Northwestern'' is pulling their northernmost string of 25 pots in a {{convert|4|mi|km}} line before the ice arrives. However, before the crew reaches the end of the string, the boat encounters the leading edge of the ice pack. The first buoy in the ice pack has moved {{convert|3|mi|km}} from where it was dropped. Captain Sig Hansen decides not to press his luck with the ice even though the pots are getting good numbers and moves his pots further south away from the ice. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is {{convert|2|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul when Captain Phil Harris decides that he can wait no longer and to push his engines to the limit to get through the ice blocking St. Paul. Only {{convert|.75|mi|km}} from the dock, oil begins to pour from the port engine and Captain Phil is forced to shut down the engine and use only the starboard engine. After two hours, the crew ties up at the dock. Captain Phil makes a call to his mechanic in Dutch Harbor to see if he is willing to fly out to St. Paul to fix his engine so that he can go back out to retrieve his pots before the ice pack swallows them. Twenty-one days into the season, the ''Wizard'' pulls up her first prospect string of the season, resulting in good numbers. Captain Keith Colburn receives a call from his brother, Monte, updating Keith on Monte's injury suffered at the beginning of the opilio season. The ice filled the harbor at St. Paul and trapped the ''Cornelia Marie'' against the dock, but Captain Phil's mechanic has caught the last flight into St. Paul and began work on the engine. The ''Incentive'' fishes into the night in {{convert|70|kn|0|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} seas with not very good results. A line breaks free of the block, snapping the line against Deckhand Doug Dawson's arm, but he escapes serious injury. After 11 hours of work, the mechanic determines that the number six cylinder of the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s port engine is the cause of the failure and it will cost $67,000 to repair. Fishing is back to normal on board the ''Wizard'', but the pace takes a toll on the greenhorns. Josh Warner leaves the deck to take a nap, and later goes up to the wheelhouse to tell Captain Keith that he is thinking of leaving the boat due to feeling humiliated by the veteran crew members. Captain Keith encourages Josh to stick it out for the rest of the season. The ''Northwestern'' has moved south onto new, untested fishing grounds. A 30-hour soak results in good numbers. Captain Sig feels momentary tightness and acute pain across his chest, but he chooses to keep it from his crew and he continues on at the helm. After five days trapped at the dock in St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s engine is repaired and there is an opening in the weather to allow her to leave. After receiving an observation on the harbor ice conditions from a United States Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk that was overhead, Captain Phil cautiously steers the boat clear of the ice in the harbor and plots a course to retrieve their northern strings before the ice pack arrives.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=62\n |EpisodeNumber2=12\n |Title=A Slap in the Face or a Kick in the Butt\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|6|30}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' has {{convert|10000|lb|kg}} to fill her tanks before her offload in 24 hours. Suffering from a cough, Captain Sig Hansen decides to try to quit smoking for a day. An arctic front approaches from the north, bringing {{convert|30|ft|m}} seas which make for a very wet deck. Captain Sig gives up on quitting smoking after three and a half hours. The ''Time Bandit'' continues to bring in good numbers after the fourth set back of pots in \"butt cheeks\" fishing grounds. Her crab tanks are packed full of crab and she heads back to St. Paul to offload. Two days after leaving St. Paul, the ''Cornelia Marie'' arrives where her pots should be, but does not find them. Captain Phil Harris must run around in circles to locate his pots. On board the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn's nerves are still frayed from the incident earlier in the season and he has been fishing in calmer waters which results in lower numbers of crab. Greenhorn Josh Warner is sleeping when the rest of the crew are eating and is slow coming out on deck. Captain Keith calls Josh up to the wheelhouse to give him an ultimatum to decide what he wants to work or quit. Before heading to offload at St. Paul, the ''Time Bandit'' makes a detour to look at the ice pack. Captain Andy Hillstrand finds that the ice pack is moving faster towards he gear that he is expecting and he must decide to either go move his northernmost pots or make a run to offload and hope that the ice pack does not reach his pots. Captain Andy decides to gamble and make the run in to offload. The ''Cornelia Marie'' managed to locate all 180 of her pots that were scattered by the sea ice. Moving to new grounds, Captain Phil claims that he can see bubbles and smell the \"crab fart\" in the water and drops a 30-pot prospect string. Headed to St. Paul, the ''Time Bandit'' finds that the ice pack is further south than Captain Andy expected. She must slowly make her way through the ice in St. Paul Harbor and use her crane to move the ice between the boat and the dock before she dock. The ''Northwestern'' has also found the ice pack on her way back to St. Paul. When she arrives, the St. Paul [[harbormaster]] calls to tell Captain Sig that the harbor is closed due to the ice. The ''Northwestern'' must drop anchor and wait out the ice. The ''Wizard''{{'}}s numbers are picking up as she hauls up the last lots of her first trip. Greenhorn Josh's work attitude is also picking up and he tells Captain Keith that he is ready to go for a second trip. Retired Engineer Lenny Lekanoff has only agreed to go on a single trip to replace the injured Monte Colburn. Captain Keith leaves a message for Monte to see if he is well enough to come back on board. After a 35-hour soak, Captain Phil Harris' theory about the \"crab fart\" appears to be true as the ''Cornelia Marie'' crew pulls up good numbers on the prospect string. The ''Northwestern'' has been anchored off St. Paul for the past three days and the crew is beginning to worry about dead loss from the crab being on board for ten days.\n |LineColor=FF5F5F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=63\n |EpisodeNumber2=13\n |Title=Ends of the Earth\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|7|7}}\n |ShortSummary=Anchored {{convert|2|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul harbor, Captain Sig Hansen decides that the four days he has already waited is long enough, heads into the harbor and pushes his way past the ice. Safely docked at the pier, Captain Sig hopes that he can offload before the harbor ices up again. The ''Incentive'' pulls up full pots of \"dirty\" ([[barnacle]]-encrusted) crab and must rail dump them overboard as the cannery will refuse the dirty crab. With three days until a delivery date, over {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} left to go, and no keepers in the string, Captain Harry Lewis decides that he must move north. As the ''Wizard'' offloads {{convert|411000|lb|kg}} of crab worth $560,000 at Dutch Harbor, Captain Keith Colburn drives to the airport to pick up his brother Monte who has returned against doctors orders with five broken ribs and new Greenhorn Jon Lawler. With the new crew and Engineer Lenny Lekanoff back into retirement, the ''Wizard'' heads back out. In {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas and {{convert|-30|F|C}} temperatures, the ''Incentive'' arrives at the northern fishing grounds and sets her pots before a storm arrives. When ice builds up on deck to dangerous levels, the crew must stop setting pots and break ice. At the southern fishing grounds, the ''Wizard'' picks up her gear to head north {{convert|5|to|10|mi|km}}. While Monte may be back on board, his broken ribs limit him to manning the wheelhouse and Captain Keith must go out to work the deck. Captain Keith has not worked the deck in over 15 years and shows the crew that he is still capable of working the deck. His time on the deck shows to him that he starting to get over the incident with his crew at the beginning of the season. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' returns to the \"crab fart\" fishing grounds. High tides make for difficult conditions hooking the buoys, but the crew manages to pull the pots on deck with an average of 600 keepers per pot. Captain Phil decides to set back on the same spot. Captain Phil notices that Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' has set his pots in the middle of the ''Cornelia Marie''{{'}}s gear. The ''Incentive''{{'}}s first northern string averages 500 keepers per pot. With the temperature dropping to {{convert|-40|F|C}}, the crew begins to suffer [[Hypothermia|Stage 1 hypothermia]] and crab begin to drop their legs when they freeze. After hauling up 45 pots, the temperature continues to drop, but the crew must grind on with another 150 pots to haul. The ''Northwestern'' has returned to the finishing grounds after being stuck in St. Paul harbor for two days and the crew rushes to pull pots before their next delivery deadline. The twenty-hour grind with poor numbers makes the crew grumpy, but Captain Sig shows no sympathy. Captain Phil Harris of the ''Cornelia Marie'' calls Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' over his view that Captain Keith set his gear over the top of ''Cornelia Marie'' gear. Captain Keith's view is that he did not intend to set his gear over the ''Cornelia Marie'' gear and that the tide moves the ''Wizard''{{'}}s gear. A storm generating {{convert|60|kn|adj=on}} and {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas hits the ''Wizard'' as she pulls up the 60 pots in the area. A {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} crashes over the bow, knocking Greenhorn Jon Lawler from the sorting table and wedging him under the launcher.

On deck, a slip by Greenhorn Jake Anderson nearly causes him to be crushed under a pot being brought on board. On board the ''Wizard'', Greenhorn Josh Warner tells Captain Keith Colburn that he will be getting off the boat at the end of this trip so that he can see his brother who is shipping off to [[Iraq]]. Captain Keith decides that a distracted Josh is a liability on deck and pulls him off the deck. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is back to averaging 600 keepers per pot now that she is no longer sharing fishing grounds with the ''Wizard''. Greenhorn Ryan Simpson accidentally steps into the crab tank, earning the rest of crew a case of beer when they get back into town. The crew of the ''Wizard'' is working a 15-hour grind with big numbers. A radio call alerts them about the approaching ice pack, forcing the crew to stack their pots on deck and move to different grounds. The ''Time Bandit'' has returned after two days to the pots she had dropped {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the ice pack before running to an offload. However, at the designated spot, the pots are nowhere to be found. After some searching, Captain Andy Hillstrand locates their pots and gets good numbers from them. He decides to set back on the same spot. On board the ''Northwestern'', Deckhand Nick Mavar, Jr's wife calls with the news that Jake's sister, Chelsea Dawn Anderson, has died. Nick tells the news to Jake and the ''Northwestern'' heads to St. Paul so that Jake can go home to be with his family. After a 47-hour shift, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' hits the rack. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand is at the wheel monitoring the ice pack that is {{convert|5|mi|km}} from their northern pots. When he receives a radio report on the movement of the pack, he rouses the crew so they can move all 80 of their pots before the ice pack reaches them. The 80 pots do not have enough crab in them to fill the boat and they must reset all 80 pots away from the ice pack. The ''Northwestern'' is {{convert|1|mi|km}} outside of St. Paul when the crew transfers Jake to another boat that is heading into port to offload.

The ''Time Bandit'' has 80 pots to pick up to finish off the last of her {{convert|40000|lb|kg}} quota before she heads to Dutch Harbor to offload. Captain Andy Hillstrand orders the crew to measure the remaining space in the middle tank, the crew ignores him. An angry Captain Johnathan Hillstrand goes on deck to do the measure himself and yell at the crew, in particular Mike Fourtner. After Captains Andy and Johnathan yell at the crew, the last pot of the season is hauled on board by a very subdued crew. After a 17-hour run, the ''Time Bandit'' arrives at Dutch Harbor where she offloads the last of her $900,000 quota. With too many deckhands on board, Captain Johnathan fires Deckhand Russell Newberry. Captain Johnathan makes a radio call to Captain Keith on the ''Wizard'' to see if he needs another deckhand. The ''Northwestern'' is trying to make up time lost from the run to St. Paul to drop off Jake Anderson. She has 72 hours to get the last {{convert|70000|lb|kg}} of her quota.

Greenhorn Josh Warner asks Captain Keith if he could have a spot on the boat if he returns in September, but Captain Keith tells him that he will not bring him back on the boat and to pack his bags. With an arctic hurricane due to hit the grounds by the end of the day, the ''Northwestern'' crew is hurrying to get all 150 of their pots on board. Low numbers of keepers put their timeline in jeopardy. Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' meets with Russell Newberry and hires him for the rest of the opilio season. Russell packs up his gear on the ''Time Bandit'' and heads over to the ''Wizard''. The crew of the ''Northwestern'' works their 50th straight hour to bring up the last of {{convert|10000|lb|kg}} of crab, capped off with the traditional flaming hook for the last pot of the season. With offload complete, the ''Wizard'' heads back out to sea. Captain Keith wants to drop all of his pots before the arctic hurricane hits with full force.

After constant single-digit counts, Captain Sig finally gives up. Captain Keith's brother, Monte, takes the helm as the ''Wizard'' tries to hunt bairdi crab. They find unprecedented numbers of keepers and meet their quota quickly, but their greenhorn Joel keeps lagging. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is on its last strings in the brunt of the storm, and the crew works its hardest to get its last 20,000 pounds of crab.

The ''Time Bandit'' has hired Jeremy Shelton as a greenhorn, and he takes the early hazing very well. On the ''Northwestern'', Edgar, who begins work on his 39th birthday, is suffering physically from years of abuse crabbing, putting Captain Sig in a tough position. The ''Cornelia Marie'' begins the season in a repair dock, needing to repair the hull, propellers and drive shafts after running aground on a reef. Paul Edgrin is the new greenhorn on the ''Wizard'', and is already acquainted with Captain Keith. Captain Bill has something to prove, and three new deckhands, on the ''Kodiak'' after a terrible king crab season. The ''Northwestern'' gets a head start, but freezing spray forces the crew to drop all their pots early. The other boats who leave later quickly ice over, and have to begin chipping ice and dumping pots very quickly. The ''Time Bandit'' doesn't bother baiting their first few strings. Jeremy is incredibly seasick. The ''Kodiak'' makes it to its target grounds, but the frozen-over stack creates a challenge. When the ''Wizard'' reaches its grounds, the weather reminds Keith of a year previous, when he nearly lost his crew to a rogue wave, so he makes sure the crew is extra careful. The ''Cornelia Marie'' finally gets underway, but when they get to their grounds after an overnight cruise, their pots are heavily iced over. Jake volunteers to hang off the edge of the stack to hammer the ice off the sides of the stack.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=73\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=We're Not in Kansas Anymore...\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|1}}\n |ShortSummary=The boats continue to clear gear after a bad case of freezing spray, dumping gear as fast as possible. When they begin pulling gear, both the ''Northwestern'' and ''Time Bandit'' find themselves on schools of bairdi crab instead of opilio, forcing them to empty their pots in the Bering Sea and move them elsewhere. To make matters worse on the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson accidentally cuts his wrist, joining Edgar on the injured list. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is worried about the performance of greenhorn Paul, wanting a greenhorn to actually last through a full season for once. On the ''Kodiak'', numbers are actually good for once, but one of the greenhorns, Clint, is messing things up. Captain Bill warns deck boss Adam to get the greenhorn in gear, or he'll find a replacement at Saint Paul. The ''Cornelia Marie's'' first string is bone dry. This wears quickly on Captain Phil, who is suffering three crushed discs in his back. On the ''Time Bandit'', in addition to pulling the wrong kind of crab, greenhorn Jeremy is suffering debilitating seasickness, as his friend, Scott Hillstrand, tries to work him through it.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=74\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Glory Days\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|8}}\n |ShortSummary=On the ''Northwestern'', both deck boss Edgar and injured deckhand Jake Anderson are bumming as Captain Sig grinds the entire crew relentlessly. Eventually, Jake can take no more with his injured hand, and walks off the deck, putting his career in jeopardy. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil heads to the \"Rock Pile\", a very tricky ground that made him famous early in his career. Although his first two strings miss, the third string finds its mark and the boat stuffs its tanks. While moving its pots to a new ground, the ''Time Bandit'' starts listing starboard due to freezing spray, and water gets into the rusted rails and the fuel tanks. They manage to filter the water out of the fuel and get their pots cast off to eliminate the list. Greenhorn Jeremy finally makes it on deck to begin working, but after a long bout of seasickness his mind isn't into it, and he eventually gives up. On the ''Wizard'', the crew plays a prank on greenhorn Paul, who has been lagging, by locking him into a pot and taking him for a ride on the crane. But with bad fishing at the time, Captain Keith doesn't appreciate the timing of the prank. One night, a call comes over the radio as a deckhand on the cod vessel ''Alaskan Leader'' has a heart attack, but bad weather stymies medevac efforts by the Coast Guard.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=75\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=The Darkened Seas\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|15}}\n |ShortSummary=The fate of the fallen deckhand on the ''Alaskan Leader'' hangs in the balance as the Coast Guard must wait several hours before finally medevacing the man to Anchorage by way of Saint Paul. After spending several days fighting freezing spray and ice, the crew of the ''Time Bandit'' begins pulling up decent numbers. Warmer weather makes deck conditions hazardous as large chunks of ice fall from the deck crane. On the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig attempts a dangerous nighttime transit of the narrow break-water into St. Paul harbor in order to offload. While in port, Jake Anderson goes to the island clinic and returns to the boat with a splint on his hand, putting his future on the boat in question. After leaving the harbor, Jake calls one of his sisters while on wheel watch to talk about his father, who has been missing for three weeks. Captain Sig gets the call saying that Jake's father's car was found abandoned on a remote logging road, letting the secret out. The ''Cornelia Marie'' finishes their record string on the 'Rock Pile' and steam for St. Paul. Along the way, Captain Phil begins to experience pain and 'strange sensations'. Unable to bear it any longer, he briefly abandons the wheelhouse to go down to his cabin, the captain's stateroom, for a pain pill. Phil discovers his youngest son, Jake, in his cabin in the act of stealing Phil's medication. Angry and emotionally hurt over this turn of events, Phil tells Jake, \"a liar and a thief\", to get out of his life. Jake begs for his forgiveness, claiming that he is \"sick\". Phil begins to realize that this was more than a simple case of theft and asks Jake in what way he is sick, with Jake admitting that he has a drug addiction.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=76\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=Blown Off Course\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary=After Jake Harris revealed his addiction to Captain Phil on the ''Cornelia Marie'', he swore he would go to rehab when the season was over. Phil told Jake that he had to get help in order to save himself, and swore his support. On the ''Time Bandit'' Captains Johnathan and Andy contemplate their future. Johnathan in particular is starting to ponder retirement, and has decided to take three weeks off. Believing Johnathan's son, Scott, will eventually captain the boat, they agree he is not yet ready. They decide instead to train Mike Fourtner as a relief captain, due to his greater knowledge and experience. On the ''Wizard'', bad fishing causes Captain Keith to resume using [[chewing tobacco]], which he promised his children he would give up. It is right then that Keith's 11-year-old daughter calls and he admits to her that she caught him red-handed. Keith gets a gentle chastising and pep-talk from his daughter while the camera zooms in on several reminders she had made for him around the wheelhouse, renewing his resolve to quit. He remarks after hanging up that she is 11 going on 21. On the ''Northwestern'', the fate of Jake Anderson's father still weighs on his mind. Eventually, Captain Sig tells him to call his mother, who relates the news she earlier told Sig that his father's truck was found, but he is nowhere to be seen. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Phil ponders Jake Harris' addiction on the steam to Saint Paul, seeing a lot of his own formative years in his younger son. He determines that Jake must put aside hard living for hard work to do what Phil knows he is capable of; one day taking over the business. Later, at Saint Paul as they offload, Phil shares some old family photos with Josh and Jake, putting the earlier confrontation with Jake aside for the moment and remembering happier times when the boys were young children. Phil then retires to his stateroom before the offload is complete. When offload is complete, engineer Steve Ward is unable to reach Phil on the shipboard phone, so he goes up to the wheelhouse to get Phil's signature. Finding it empty, Steve checks down in Phil's stateroom and finds him collapsed on the floor. Phil has suffered a massive [[stroke]], unable to move the left side of his body but still conscious. Jake breaks down as paramedics work on him, then move him off the boat by crane before loading him into an ambulance.

He's going to be medevaced to Anchorage with Jake, as Josh begins planning for the boat finishing its season without him. Josh later gets an update from Jake, who tells him that Phil will have a portion of skull removed to relieve the pressure. While seeking advice, Josh talks with Deckhand Freddy Maughtai, who urges Josh to fly down to Anchorage and be with Phil and Jake. Josh, however, feels that his father would want him to take care of the ''Cornelia Marie'', his legacy, in his absence and that he owes his old man to do so. Freddy tells him that if Phil dies and he isn't there, he will regret it for the rest of this life. \"Season every year... crab every year... Dad, no. There's only one Dad, bro. The crab is always catch. We always make money, every year. But we cannot catch a Dad every year.\" Freddy reveals how his own father died in the hospital in [[Australia]] while he was out during an opilio season with Phil; his aunt called to inform him, and he went home not seeing his father but a dead body. He leaves Josh with his thoughts, making his decisions much harder.\n\nThe ''Time Bandit'' begins pulling a new string as Captain Andy starts training Mike Fourtner as a relief captain. His first string of five pots doesn't bring up good numbers. On the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson is torn between wanting to go search for his missing father, and his family desiring him to remain on his boat. The crew suffers a near-miss when a pot snaps free of the crane, and Jake is able to save the pot, but Sig admonishes him to let it go next time in case a hook is swinging free. Sig doesn't mind having to buy another pot in such a situation; his crew's safety is worth more than any pot. On the ''Kodiak'', the crew finally sees good numbers as they approach their first opilio delivery date. But the crew is being dragged down by deckhand Clint, and Wild Bill has to put him in his place. Despite early counting issues, they hit their first delivery with crab to spare, and Wild Bill gives his crew some shore leave, only requesting that they don't have any hard liquor. He's worried Clint won't make the midnight curfew, but the entire crew misses it, and it's Jake that has the issues in the morning, not Clint.\n\nThe first evening after Phil's stroke, Josh begins notifying the crews, telling Captain Andy first. Andy relays it to Johnathan, in case he's passing through Anchorage on the way stateside. When Sig finds out from Andy, he throws his cigarettes away across the wheelhouse in a fit of anger. Andy and Sig inform their crews; Jake Anderson takes it particularly hard, knowing what the Harris boys are going through possibly losing their father. Sig passes it on to Captain Keith, who breaks down upon hearing the news.

The crew takes a break to celebrate Jake's six months of sobriety from a situation pre-season. Their next delivery date is jeopardized as they hit a nursery and draw low numbers of keepers. Edgar Hansen feels the job is killing him, and is feeling the end of his career drawing closer with each grind. Sig overhears Edgar's personal concerns, and thinks if he's close to quitting, he should get serious about training a replacement. Sig thinks Edgar's problem is that he's the one everybody goes to on the deck. The ''Wizard'' grinds through ice on the north side of the crab grounds to get some ice-covered strings pulled. Frequent calls from his daughter try to keep Captain Keith in line regarding kicking his tobacco habit. The crew gets breakfast as Keith and Monte try to work through the ice. Keith sees a seal. They find clear ice, and their pots. They also manage good numbers, convincing them to gamble and keep fishing there. The ''Kodiak'' returns to the grounds and takes to its soaking pots. The numbers are outrageously good, and the crew is finally clicking. But when the numbers dry up, some pots show they weren't properly secured, allowing crab to escape. Wild Bill chews out his crew after the string, then calls in reinforcements, prepared to fire one of his crew if things don't shape up. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Andy is losing focus with his brother keeping watch over Captain Phil. The crew pulls crab pots in \u221230\u00b0F weather, conditions cold enough to make the crab fall apart before they get in the tank. To make it worse, everyone is sniping on Mike Fourtner, since he's being groomed for the captain's chair.\n\nA day after surgery, with more friends in town, Captain Phil is making progress, and is breathing on his own again. He manages to be able to speak as well, and cons Jake into giving him an ice chip early. Three days after surgery, those around him are really feeling down with his vulnerable condition. Josh and Jake are regularly arguing about things, with Jake seeing Josh as being more concerned about the ''Cornelia Marie'' than their father, but Josh seeing Jake as drowning his sorrow in alcohol and drugs and not really caring about anything. Johnathan just happens to come up to the brothers hotel room and catches most of the shouted argument through the door, which saddens him as he goes back down to the lobby.

Back on the ''Time Bandit'', Mike Fourtner's jitters with the hook continue, and Scotty Hillstrand is eager to prove himself in Mike's place. On the ''Northwestern'', bad numbers continue to lengthen their grind, which only makes the crew miserable and long for home. In Anchorage, the neurologist tells Josh to begin making preparations to move Phil to a rehab facility in Seattle, though the actual move is still some time away as they wait for the rest of his swelling to go down. Bad numbers are plaguing the ''Kodiak'', and deckhand Clint continues to be seen as a thorn in the crew's side. Wild Bill, tired of the crew as a whole, makes a call ahead to hire a new deckhand. The ''Time Bandit'' goes to a new prospect string, where Scotty proves no better at the hook than Mike. Captain Andy's gamble on a deeper string is an utter bust. Andy and Neal determine that making the crew hate the Captain is better than allowing the crew to turn on each other.\n\nIn Anchorage, Jake Harris broods over his demons, and calls a substance abuse clinic in Seattle to admit himself into rehab. He goes to Phil to tell him. Phil is proud of his son for finally getting the help he needs. Captain Johnathan and Josh take him to the airport to fly home to Seattle.\n\nA storm brews in the Bering Sea, and the ''Northwestern'' hopes to finally catch some luck. Ready for a break, Edgar begins to train Jake Anderson on the hydros. After a good amount of luck, he finally slips a pot out of the dogs, and it slides into the crab table without toppling. In Dutch, the ''Kodiak'' offloads another 210,000 pounds of crab, and picks up a new deckhand, Randy. But he talks to the crew before Wild Bill actually fired somebody to make room. After finishing the offload, Wild Bill fires Clint to make room for Randy.\n\nIn Anchorage, Phil tells Josh he regrets not being there as much as he wanted to, but Josh shows no regrets for his upbringing as he says that Phil taught him everything that he needed to know to be a man. During their exchange, Josh breaks down and has to step out, not wanting his dad to see him cry. On another day, Phil asks Josh to go get his good-luck bracelet from his hotel room when he returns in the evening. As a furious arctic storm pounds the fishing grounds, Phil deteriorates rapidly, and Josh is summoned to the hospital. Despite doctors' best efforts, Phil succumbs to complications of his stroke.\n\n{{center|Captain Phil Harris<br />December 19, 1956 \u2013 February 9, 2010}}\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=80\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=Valhalla\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|20}}\n |ShortSummary=As the storm rages through the crab grounds, hauling pots gets really complicated on the ''Northwestern''. As numbers dwindle and weather worsens, the risk outweighs the reward and Captain Sig gives up, willing to take being up to 4,000 pounds short over losing some or all of his crew. In Saint Paul, where the ''Cornelia Marie'' is still preparing to get underway, Freddy Maugatai is in the wheelhouse when Josh Harris calls to pass along the news that Captain Phil had died. Breaking down, he heads into the engine room to inform the rest of the crew, and he and Steve Ward share a moment of tearful consolation. An eerie calm passes over the crab grounds, and the captains, who don't know of Phil's fate yet, express their concerns.\n\nMost northern of the ships right now, the ''Kodiak'' works in frigid conditions in an attempt to fish the edge of the ice pack. Although Wild Bill doesn't regret getting rid of deckhand Clint, having two new deckhands doesn't help when the air temperature is \u221240 \u00b0F/C and visibility is 15 feet. Poor returns from the pots prompt a northward trek. Due to the freezing temperatures, the hydraulic system onboard develops a problem. Deck boss Adam shuts down the hydraulic system for repairs, inadvertently endangering the oblivious crew above when a pot suspended from the now-paralyzed deck crane swings uncontrollably before it can be tethered. The broken hydraulic line is replaced and fishing continues.\n\nThe ''Time Bandit'' needs to fill two of its three tanks in the next 48 hours. The crew seems to be working better, and the numbers improve as well, giving hope that they will make the next delivery. Jeremy hauls bait hard, and Captain Andy decides to teach him how to throw buoys. But his arms are so sore, he can't throw them very far, and one gets caught on the rail, potentially endangering the boat. To the west of Saint Paul, the ''Wizard'' sees good fishing along the ice pack. The problem is, Captain Keith sees the crew getting nonchalant about their jobs. He comes down from the wheelhouse to give them a pep talk, telling them to speed up the process so they can plug the tanks and get back in. Deckhand Lynn Guitard continues to lag behind and gets messy with tying up the stack, prompting an additional talking-to from Keith at the wheelhouse window.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' gets into Saint Paul early, 10 hours before its delivery time. After some downtime with the crew, Captain Sig goes to the ''Cornelia Marie'' to introduce himself to relief captain Derrick Ray. It is here that he finds out that Captain Phil is gone; it was the same evening Derrick found out. The galley of the ''Northwestern'' is somber after Sig relays the news to his crew, who fights their emotions. The word spreads quickly from there through the crews. As the ''Northwestern'' leaves, they slowly pass the ''Cornelia Marie''. Jake Anderson breaks down as they salute the boat. Andy comments that it's time to retire his American flag on the ''Time Bandit''; the storm has ripped it into a barely recognizable tangle of fibers. He compares it to the season in general.\n\nIn Seattle, Phil's family gathers for his funeral service. Among the mourners with Jake and Josh are their mother and Phil's father. His ashes are placed in two motorcycle fuel tanks. One is buried in Seattle at his funeral; Jake and Josh plan to spread his ashes from the other during the next King Crab season. The ''Time Bandit'' has a moment of silence. On the ''Northwestern'', Sig mentions the tale that seagulls carry the spirits of lost sailors; he reckons that one sitting on the bow at that moment might just be Phil. On the ''Wizard'', a tearful Keith oversees as the crew loads a full crab pot, packing its shot and buoys within so it stays on the bottom as a memorial, so Phil will always have a full pot to come back to. The ''Time Bandit'' memorializes Phil in their own typical style: by setting off their fireworks. The final shot sees the ''Wizard'' send their pot over as Keith tolls the ship's bell eight times.\n |LineColor=FFFF00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=81\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=Endless\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|7|27}}\n |ShortSummary=The boats make their final pushes of the painful 2010 opilio crab season. The ''Time Bandit'' replaces its torn-up U.S. flag. Their plan is to set gear one more time, pick up Captain Johnathan, then go pick their gear up. The ''Northwestern'' crew is finally beginning to break. The ''Cornelia Marie'' picks up Josh Harris, who is determined to finish the year, as Captain Phil would've wanted. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is concerned with plugging his tanks one more time to meet his quota. Wild Bill on the ''Kodiak'' is rushing through his gear, hoping to get one more set of strings pulled before the ice pack swallows them. He is gambling on only using the smaller orange diver pots on his final set of strings, to minimize the risk of the ice moving them.\n\nOnce Captain Johnathan returns to the ''Time Bandit'', he and Captain Andy deliberate on how big Mike's ego grew when he got a taste of the captain's chair. One night on the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig is unable to sleep, with Captain Phil on his mind. Edgar is long since over this season, and continues to train Jake Anderson on more aspects of the deck. They get good enough numbers to pack the pots away. Sig finally realizes that he'll need to eventually find a replacement for Edgar. Back on the ''Time Bandit'', Mike and Scotty continue their feud. Andy fuels it by putting Scotty back on the rail. He snags the first buoy, but Mike drops it. Their first pot doesn't look promising, and it also falls out of the dogs. Later pots have better numbers, giving hope that this set of strings will be their last of the season. Captain Johnathan joins the deck crew to help sorting, and they clean house with a final total of $1.2 million.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' is officially on its final pots, finishing with a total of $990,000. To honor Captain Phil, they throw several flaming hooks for the final pot, which is totally stuffed with crab. As for the ''Kodiak'', they have to cruise through the ice pack for the final set of 30 pots. He moves quickly through the gear hoping for good numbers. He gets the numbers he's looking for, and finally secures a good season. The gamble paid off, with a final opilio tally of $1.6 million. On the ''Wizard'', they are back in the crab as well, ending up with crab oozing back on the deck. Captain Keith gives Lynn Guitard the final hook throw, rewarding him for cleaning up his act. He ends up shanking a long throw, but nails a retry without needing to turn around. The crew finishes with earnings of $1.8 million on a record haul.\n\nBack on the ''Northwestern'' on its final steam to Dutch Harbor, Edgar notifies Sig that he needs a break so he can take care of his family. He makes it clear he's putting his wife and children ahead of the boat from now on. Sig still doesn't believe Edgar will give the boat up. As for Jake Anderson, he'll fly ahead to finally address his missing father. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Andy tells Mike Fourtner to be mindful of his ego next season as he is given more time in the captain's chair. Jake Harris heads to an addiction clinic in Palm Springs, California.\n\nTen weeks later, in April 2010, the ''Cornelia Marie'', with Josh Harris heading a four-man deck and Captain Derrick in the wheelhouse, finally finishes its opilio season. Josh is determined to remain in the fishery for the foreseeable future.

Phil's ashes are placed in a crab pot and then dropped into the sea (which according to Josh Harris was his fathers' wish), and the crews set off fireworks (and a few guns) into the air. The ''Kodiak'', the ''Time Bandit'', the ''Northwestern'', the ''Wizard'', and the ''Cornelia Marie'' (now under Captain Derrick Ray) are joined this season by two new boats: the ''Seabrooke'' (Captain Scott Campbell, Jr.), and the ''Ramblin' Rose'' (Captain Elliot Neese).<br /><br />The season is barely under way but tensions are already running high. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', still in dock at Dutch Harbor, Jake & ships' mechanic Steve go on a shopping trip without letting Captain Derrick know. On their return Derrick & Steve get into a shouting match that nearly escalates into a physical confrontation. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith listens to a distress call from cargo vessel ''Ever Unique'' regarding a crew member with a broken neck. The Coast Guard medivac chopper is dispatched to retrieve him, and despite the size of the massive ship, has a difficult time finding a suitable spot to lower their man. On the ''Northwestern'', it is teased that Edgar Hansen has left the boat, with Sig wondering where his \"baby brother \" is. Edgar eventually is seen and begins work for his 23rd season. Meanwhile, Jake runs back and forth between the deck and the kitchen trying to have a meal ready for the crew who are confronted with a potentially work-ending issue with the crane. On the ''Seabrooke'', problems are less serious: an empty coffee pot. While the coffee pot may be empty, they find full crab pots. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan's tactic of setting on scallop beds does not pay off. On the ''Wizard'', a pot is lost when the line gets caught in the propeller. The rest of the pots come up empty, forcing Captain Keith to rethink his plans. Captain Derrick & Steve have agreed to set their issues aside and focus on fishing, and the ''Cornelia Marie'' finally leaves Dutch Harbor. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', Captain Elliot is upset when his crew parties all night and leaves a mess for him to clean up. In a meeting in the wheelhouse the other crew members blame Naiuli, and Captain Elliot decides to kick him off the boat.\n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=83\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Proving Grounds\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|4|19}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Cornelia Marie'' and the ''Ramblin' Rose'' struggle to catch blue king crab.

On board the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith Colburn moves to a spot last used during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but still can not find the crab. Concerned about his brother being on the stack, Captain Keith orders his brother Monte to take greenhorn Paul Edgren up on top to train him. When the crew grumbles about Paul slowing down the deck, Captain Keith pulls the entire crew from the deck and berates them about not following his orders. The ''Northwestern'' gets good numbers from their first string of the season and sets back. Still on the crab, the ''Seabrooke'' also sets back.

Josh Harris asks Captain Derrick Ray for assurance that they will find the crab. Egged on by the crew, Jake Harris asks for and receives time at the helm. Then next day, when he asks for a second time at the helm, Captain Derrick Ray tells him no when he believes that he smells marijuana on Jake. Two weeks into the season with low numbers, Captain Keith of the ''Wizard'' pulls out all of the superstitions to catch crab in an area called Black Canyon, but the good luck doesn't come and the boat continues to pull in low numbers. Greenhorn Paul Edgren gets caught up in the line of a pot, but the crew saves him from going overboard. Seeing no sign of changing numbers, Captain Keith decides to move to where his partner boat has good fishing. The numbers caught by the ''Seabrooke'' drop off, causing Deck Boss Bob Perkey to grip about Captain Scott \"JR\" Campbell. Junior decides that Bob has to go once they reach port to offload their red crab quota. Bob's son, greenhorn Kyle Babb also voluntarily leaves the boat. Hoping to break their own bad luck, the crew of the Time Bandit fires an [[AK-47]] and [[AR-15]] at a buoy named after former deckhand John Jorgensen who left the boat after the previous season, but their prospect string produces low numbers and the crew move on to a different fishing spot. \n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=85\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title=Breaking Point\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|5|3}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Seabrooke'' takes on an enthusiastic new greenhorn before heading off to go blue crab fishing. After two hours of fishing, the greenhorn enters the wheelhouse complaining that he has reached his mental breaking point after being hazed by the rest of the crew. On board the still struggling ''Cornelia Marie'', tensions run high as both captain and crew begin to doubt each other. Josh and Jake Harris confront Captain Derrick Ray about the low numbers and how Derrick is running the boat. After getting a report on incoming weather and fearing dead loss, the ''Cornelia Marie'' anchors behind [[St. Matthew Island]] to wait on the storm. On board the ''Kodiak'', a broken hydraulic system in the deck crane forces the crew to push pots on deck. Deckhand Jake Jolibois injures his back after slipping on the deck. Jake refuses to come off deck until Captain Bill Wichrowski orders him off deck.

However, a power failure leaves the boat drifting uncontrollably towards the dock. While the rest of the crew ineffectively scrambles to drop the anchor, Edgar Hansen switches over to the auxiliary engine and restores power to the boat. On board the ''Wizard'', the low numbers of crab makes Captain Keith Colburn feel that there is \"bad juju\" on board the boat and he orders the crew to sweep the boat for anything out of the ordinary. The crew finds a broken guitar handle belonging to Captain Andy Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' that the crew had taken from him during an incident at a bar in town. The crew tosses the handle overboard, but the poor numbers continue. The next day, when Deck Boss Monte Colburn heads inside to take a break, he finds a seagull in the galley. Seagulls are thought to be the souls of lost seaman, so the crew takes it as a good sign that their luck as changed. Their luck does change as big numbers of crab finally come over the rail. When Deckhand Lynn Guitard takes wheel watch on the trip in to offload, he falls asleep at the wheel after turning off the watch alarm. The ''Seabrooke'' heads out to the blue king crab grounds. Low numbers of crab force the crew to step up the pace, which causes the greenhorn to struggle. He finally pulls himself off the deck when he can no longer deal with the cramps in his hands. On board the ''Northwestern'', Jake Anderson takes the poor results of his town soak string of pots personally. When Jake and Edgar Hansen have a fierce argument, Captain Sig Hansen counsels Jake on how to handle the situation. Still pulling low numbers, Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' heads back to the \"slime banks\" to fish an area that he did not cover weeks earlier. While the crew is dubious since the \"slime banks\" had produced low numbers, the gamble pays off and the ''Time Bandit'' pulls up good numbers.\n |LineColor=05615E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=87\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Exit Wounds\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2011|5|17}}\n |ShortSummary=Captain Keith Colburn of the ''Wizard'' catches deckhand Lynn Guitard asleep during the wheel watch. The next day, Lynn apologizes, but Keith tells him that he may never do another wheel watch again, but if he does and falls asleep again, he will be fired immediately. When the ''Wizard'' finally offloads after a 15-day trip, Captain Keith sees more dead loss that he would have liked. On the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan Hillstrand shuts down the deck after heavy seas knock deckhand Mike Fourtner off his feet. Captain Johnathan is worries that the crab bio mass might move while the deck is shut down, but the fears prove unfounded when good numbers are pulled in once the weather clears. On board the ''Kodiak'', Deck Boss Adam McCalden's constant belittling of the crew about working slowly forces Captain Bill Wichrowski to order him off deck. With deckhand Jack Jolibois still down with a back injury, the boat has to work with a three man deck. After offloading {{convert|16000|lb|kg}} of blue king crab, the Harris brothers tell Captain Derrick Ray that if the ''Cornelia Marie'' does not have good numbers with the town soak string that the boat needs to abandon blue king crab fishing and go red king crab fishing. When the string pulls up blanks, the boat heads off to the red crab grounds. However, on the way, the crew decides that they can no longer work under Captain Derrick they decide to end their king crab season. The ''Seabrooke's'' big push before heading to offload is made harder when the greenhorn does not come back on deck after quitting. After offloading {{convert|50000|lb|kg}} of blue king crab worth $250,000, the boat gets a new greenhorn, Josh \"Stroker\" Graves, as the previous greenhorn departs.

Captain Derrick calls the [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] Police Department about his suspicions and asks them to be at the dock when the boat arrives at Dutch Harbor. When Captain Derrick confronts the crew about what he finds, the crew deny that it is theirs. On board the ''Northwestern'', the crab count picks up after Edgar Hansen apologizes to Jake Anderson, easing the tension between them that started after Jake's town soak string pulled up low numbers. The deck of the ''Kodiak'' is back to a five-man crew after deckhand Jake Jolibois says he is recovered enough to help on deck and Deck Boss Adam McCalden apologizes to Captain Wichrowski for his treatment of the rest of the crew. However, the five-man deck does not last for long as the short handed work has taken a toll on long time deckhand Eric Anderson's foot and he is ordered off deck. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', Captain Elliot Neese's pushing of the crew makes crew morale drop. When Deck Boss Kevin \"Kado\" Davis is injured and weather not improving, Captain Elliot reconsiders his push and shuts down the deck.

On board the ''Time Bandit'', lack of sleep causes tempers to flare between deckhands Mike Fourtner and Justin Tennison. A line jumps out the block and over Mike Fourtner and Scott Hillstrand. Quick reactions in jumping over the line prevent the line from dragging the two overboard. While fishing their last string of the season, the compressor motor that runs the hydraulics on the ''Ramblin' Rose'' overheats and fails. Captain Elliot Neese patches together a fix with a compressor used to fill the buoys. The crew races to retrieve the last 200 pots before the patched together hydraulics fails. On the ''Cornelia Marie'', Captain Tony Lara swaps positions with deckhand Jake Harris while retrieving a string to give Jake more experience at the helm. Captain Tony tears his right bicep muscle while loading a shot into a crab pot and heads off deck. Captain Tony lets Josh set his first string ever. On a 48-hour push with low numbers of crab, Captain Scott Campbell of the ''Seabrooke'' succumbs to the pain of a passing [[kidney stone]] and leaves the wheelhouse.

A friendly wager is made between Captain Scott Campbell Jr. and Captain Elliott Neese, the first boat to catch 100,000 pounds of crab gets $1000.00. The ''Seabrooke'' is on good fishing, but the ''Ramblin' Rose'' is having problems finding crab and with rough seas. Elliott is having attitude problems on deck. On the Red crab grounds, the ''Time Bandit'' is on the 'slime banks' for another year carrying the ashes of deckhand Justin Tennison who died on February 11th, 2011 in his home town of Homer, Alaska. Also on the Red crab grounds, aboard the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig Hansen and brother Edgar discuss Edgar's future. A leak in a hydraulic line halts fishing until Edgar repairs it. They are rewarded with full pots, catching 25,000 pounds of crab in one day. Back on the Blue crab grounds Captain Scott Campbell Jr. notices his pots are starting to come up light and realizes that the ''Ramblin' Rose'' has 'potted him down' placing pots along his string.

He is pulling small pots and the crew is being careless at the sorting table. The main culprit is Captain Scott's brother, Chris 'Whip' Welch. As a storm moves into the Blue crab grounds, the ''Ramblin' Rose'' pulls the last of its string of pots set on Captain Scott's string. Frustrated with poor fishing, bad weather and the attitude of his crew, Captain Elliott heads out onto the deck to confront his crew about their attitude and the state of disarray on the deck. The ''Wizard'' is caught in the same storm as the other two boats on the Blue crab grounds. ''Wizard'' greenhorn Danny Maki is struggling to keep up with the other deckhands and when he injures his leg, the hardened crew shows him no mercy. On the Red crab grounds, the ''Time Bandit'' has landed on the crab and Captain Johnathan Hillstrand has decided it is the right time to spread deckhand Justin Tennisons' ashes. The crew gathers on deck to pay their respects and spread his ashes into the Bering Sea along with a Jolly Roger flag. Gunfire and shouts ring out as they bid him a last farewell. On board the ''Kodiak'', Captain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski is frustrated with the empty pots and his new crew member, Jason Rainwater. He's having a hard time fitting in and doesn't take direction well. Captain Bill notices that Rainwater isn't measuring the crab and reminds him that the crew pays the fine for having small crab in the tanks and the other crew members turn on him as well. Rainwater is put on the rail, hauling pots that start coming up full changing the climate on deck and in the wheelhouse. Captain Scott is still struggling with poor numbers and poor attitude on deck. Chris 'Whip' Welch gets his arm caught under the block and spends 12 hours with ice on it. After a pep talk from Captain Scott, Whip returns to the deck. The ''Ramblin' Rose'' is re-setting gear with an exhausted crew in very poor weather. Their negative comments are heard in the wheelhouse, further frustrating Captain Elliott.

Captain Scott Campbell Jr. is getting respectable numbers but the weather and rough seas are hard on his crew.\"The Ramblin' Rose\" is dealing with the same storm. On the \"Wizard\", Captain Keith Colburn checks on his injured deckhand, Danny Maki, and convinces him to go back to work. The \"Wizard\" has had problems finding Blue crab and Captain Keith makes the decision to abandon the Blue crab grounds and switch to Red crab. On the \"Kodiac\", Captain Wild Bill Wichrowski is pulling stuffed pots and decides it is a good time to put his son Zack on the hook. Zack does well at first, but halfway through the string things start to fall apart for him. Captain Wild Bill goes down to the deck to give Zack the benefit of his experience with a few pointers, but leaves frustrated after an offhand remark from Zack. On the \"Northwestern\", Jake Harris is getting a lesson on throwing the hook 'Norwegian style'. After four tries he finally manages to snag the pot. Lesson over, Captain Sig puts Edgar back on the hook. The \"Seabrooke\" is pulling into St. Paul for the first offload of Blue crab of the season. As they are leaving they meet the \"Ramblin' Rose\" on the way in to offload.

The biggest storm of the season is battering the ''Ramblin' Rose'' as it continues to haul near empty pots on the Blue crab grounds. Captain Elliott Neese notices the starboard engine isn't going into gear and heads to the engine room. The problem is a snapped shifting cable that he is able to replace, but the morale of the crew is at an all-time low. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand of the ''Time Bandit'' has promised his granddaughter that he'll quit smoking on her birthday and at midnight he and deckhand Josh Harris both quit smoking. On the Blue crab grounds, the ''Seabrooke'' is in the middle of the storm with a full load of pots on the deck. The crew spends the next three hours setting 35 pots to lighten the load. The ''Northwestern'' has been on good fishing for three weeks but the numbers are falling. The deckboss, Edgar Hansen, notices the signs of a rat on board, catches it and drops it into a barrel. They decide to set it free the next time they dock. Captain Sig comments that Norway rats are good luck on a boat. The pots start coming up full again. In Dutch Harbour, the ''Wizard''s newest greenhorn, Chris Scambler, prepares for his first trip. Brady Quinn is the other ''Wizard'' greenhorn. On the ''Time Bandit'' it's been eight hours since Captain Johnathan Hillstrand has had a cigarette and the pressure is on. He has 24 hours before his scheduled off-load and he needs some luck to fill his tanks. Deckhand Josh Harris caves in and has a cigarette after some ribbing from the rest of the crew. As the ''Wizard'' arrives on the Red crab grounds, finding bad weather, greenhorn Chris Scambler questions his decision to take this job. On the ''Seabrooke'' the weather is bad but the fishing is good when an alarm sounds from the engine room. Captain Scott Campbell Jr. goes to investigate and discovers that the ''Seabrooke'' has blown one of her two main engines. ''Wizard'' Captain Keith Colburn phones his brother Monte to ask about greenhorn Chris Scambler and voices his concerns. Chris is struggling as the veteran crew tries to teach him what he needs to know to work on the deck of a crab boat. Chris goes to the wheelhouse and confesses to Captain Keith that he is terrified and not sure if he can continue. Captain Keith gives him no option but to return to work and Chris heads back out on deck of the ''Wizard''.\n |LineColor=F0E68C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=103\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Vital Signs\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2012|5|15}}\n |ShortSummary=The ''Northwestern'' is on the Red crab grounds when deckboss Edgar Hansen receives a call from home. His wife has just returned from Norway, where her mother has died. The ''Northwestern'' only needs 30,000 pounds to fill the boat but the fishing is terrible. After being at sea only four days, ''Wizard'' greenhorn Chris Scambler is struggling as Captain Keith Colburn shuts down fishing due to the bad weather. The ''Seabrooke'' is in St. Paul for their second off-load of blue crab and it's enough to win the bet with Captain Elliott Neese. Captain Scott Campbell Jr. calls his father to see if he has been able to source any parts to fix the ''Seabrooke's'' crippled engine but none are available. The weather is worsening as Captain Scott decides to leave St. Paul before they shut the harbour down. It's a treacherous exit with the current pushing the ''Seabrooke'' toward the rocky shore. ''Ramblin' Rose'' Captain Elliott Neese receives a call from the ship's owners telling him if he doesn't start producing they will send another ship up to take his place. Because the fishing is so bad, Captain Elliott pushes his crew even harder to produce. The ''Wizard'' is fighting 25-foot seas and Captain Keith Colburn orders his greenhorns, Chris Scambler and Brady Quinn, to take shelter on deck for their own safety. After a pot breaks loose from the crane and crashes to the deck, Captain Keith orders everyone off deck. There are hurricane warnings on the Blue crab grounds as the ''Seabrook'' struggles to pull pots with one engine. When the weather improves on the Red crab grounds the ''Wizard'' starts fishing again but greenhorn, Chris Scambler, is suffering from severe pain in his right shoulder and arm. First Mate Gary Soper leads Chris off deck and Captain Keith goes down to find he's collapsed and showing signs of shock. With his health deteriorating, Captain Keith decides to call the Coast Guard. Luckily, they are only about 15 minutes away. As the crew stays with Chris and tries to get him to drink some fluids, his condition worsens.\n |LineColor=F0E68C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=104\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=I Don't Wanna Die\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2012|5|22}}\n |ShortSummary=''Wizard'' greenhorn Chris Scambler is in serious trouble as Captain Keith Colburn and the rest of the crew await the USCG 6010 helicopter. When the rescue swimmer is dropped on deck and goes below to access Chris's condition he decides that Chris must be air-lifted and taken to Cold Bay for treatment. After the lift the crew and Captain Keith are in a state of shock and questioning their treatment of Chris. They go back to work and dedicate the first string to Chris. An Arctic hurricane is threatening to shut down fishing. It is the worst storm since 1977, and on the Blue crab grounds most of the fleet is anchored behind St. Matthew's Island but the ''Ramblin' Rose'' continues to fish. The weather and the fishing are both terrible and the crew is feeling the brunt of the storm. Finally a call comes in from the boat's owner and Captain Elliott Neese is ordered to join the rest of the fleet behind St. Matthew's Island. The crew is relieved but Captain Elliott is livid. On the Red crab grounds the ''Northwestern'' is trying to top off its tanks before the storm hits. As the last pot comes in sight Deckboss Edgar Hansen asks Jake Harris to throw the 'flaming hook'. After the final Red King crab pot is pulled Jake Harris is invited back aboard the ''Northwestern'' for the Opilio season. On the Blue crab grounds the ''Seabrooke'' is the last boat still fishing in the storm. Captain Scott Campbell Jr. is on the crab but is still fishing with only one of his two main engines. When Captain Scott decides to seek shelter behind St. Matthews he has to travel through the deadly Shelikof Strait.

The ''Wizard'' gets back relief captain Monte Colburn along with new greenhorn Roger Schlosstein, but Monte and engineer Lenny Lekanoff are still dealing with injuries. Fortunately, Captain Keith Colburn's luck is better than that of the rest of the fleet, as full pots come over the side on the first string. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', half the crew is new after a trying king crab season, and deck boss Kevin \"Kado\" Davis defects to the ''Seabrooke'' after being cut loose by Captain Elliott Neese for attitude problems. Captain Elliott's job in the wheelhouse is on the line, but his mind is with his children and ex-girlfriend, who he broke up with in the offseason and isn't returning his calls. The ''Seabrooke'' is forced to turn back to Dutch Harbour after Captain Scott Campbell, Jr. discovers the port engine is running hot, threatening to delay the start of their season for weeks. The ''Time Bandit's'' luck is worst of all - in rapid succession, deckhand Travis Lofland falls overboard at the dock in Dutch, the coiler is damaged beyond use after the crew foolishly decides to use mortars to de-ice the boat (forcing the crew to coil by hand for the trip), and the first string set by Captain Andy Hillstrand comes up with blanks. The ''Kodiak'' dodges a bullet when an icy pot loosened by a snapped line barely misses Captain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski's son Zack, while on the ''Northwestern'', deck boss Edgar Hansen bumps heads with Captain Sig Hansen over stacking the pots, while deckhand Jake Harris gets under his skin for being first off the deck.\n |LineColor=F0E68C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=107\n |EpisodeNumber2=10\n |Title=Rise and Fall\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2012|6|12}}\n |ShortSummary=With the ice pack continuing to descend south and his pot counts decreasing, Captain Keith Colburn makes the seemingly antithetical decision to stack the deck of the ''Wizard'' and head north towards the ice to less crowded grounds. However, junior deckhand Lynn Guitard's repeated failures (first at throwing the hook, then at properly tying down the stack) slow the boat's progress and get under Captain Keith's skin; with greenhorn Roger Schlosstein impressing the crew with his effort and earning a 0.5% raise, it appears Lynn's days on the ''Wizard'' may be numbered. Meanwhile, Captain Sig Hansen keeps the ''Northwestern'' on crowded grounds and is rewarded when full pots come over the rail. Deck boss Edgar Hansen, dealing with a significant amount of pain, finally asks an elated Captain Sig to drive the boat during hauling; deckhand Jake Anderson will get to run the deck when Edgar is in the wheelhouse. The ''Time Bandit'' is also on the crab, keeping morale high in the face of having to coil all the pots by hand. Captain Johnathan Hillstrand decides to join the crew on deck to help with the coiling, but his time there is short-lived when he aggravates an old back injury. On the ''Ramblin' Rose'', it's the same old story for distracted Captain Elliott Neese as the first string comes up near empty. On the ''Kodiak'', it's worse, as Captain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski is forced to shut down sparse fishing after two of his crew nearly come to blows, and he forces them to sign a hastily written document threatening them with immediate termination for any future unprofessional behavior.\n |LineColor=F0E68C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=108\n |EpisodeNumber2=11\n |Title=No Exit\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2012|6|19}}\n |ShortSummary=Across the fleet, captains battle the descending polar ice pack to save their pots, and it's a losing war.

You know what's different? It's called 'entitlement'.\" Switching to footage of four offspring of Alaska crabbers: ''Saga'' - Captain Elliott Neese says \"This job is for the elite. The rest of these guys can go to pasture.\" ''Northwestern'' - 18-year-old Mandy Hansen, daughter of Captain Sig and niece of Edgar and Norman says \"I'm doing it. At some point I have to. It's in my blood.\" ''Cornelia Marie'' - Captain Josh Harris says \"I'm just doing what I know to do, instead of what other people tell me I ''should'' be doing.\" ''Seabrooke'' - Captain Scott Campbell Jr. says \"If you can't tow your weight, it's time for you to go.\" Over footage of the Hillstrands on the ''Time Bandit'' and ''Wizard'' and ''Northwestern'' decks, Keith says, \"You want to be top dog?\", before switching to him sitting in the ''Wizard'' wheelhouse saying \"Be careful what you wish for.\" More season preview footage before the opening credits roll.\n\nAs October rolls around, 2013 King Crab season boat preparations go off without a hitch, except for something no one foresaw: a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|Federal government shutdown]] which closed the office that issues permits/quotas for the fishery. Jake Anderson returns to the ''Northwestern'' after being mistreated on the ''Kiska Sea'' (during 2013 Opilio season).\n\nThe Hillstrands and Hansens conspire on an epic double-double-cross prank involving deckhand Nick \"Sunshine\" Tokeman, who left the ''Northwestern'' upon Jake's return to fill the gap in the ''Time Bandit'' crew created by Josh Harris' return to the ''Cornelia Marie'' as her Captain.\n\nCaptain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski on the ''Cape Caution'' takes on an ex-Marine greenhorn with Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishing experience. Junior aggravates his back injury changing a deck light bulb on the ''Seabrooke''.\n\nA capless and bald Captain Keith is in [[Washington, D.C.]] to testify before the Senate Commerce committee while Monte preps the ''Wizard'', with, miraculously, no new greenhorns to break in. The fleet's Captains and some deckhands watch the [[C-SPAN|C-SPAN 3]] broadcast testimony in the local bar.\n\nAfter 3 years of fishing blue king crab, Captain Elliott preps for his first season on the red king crab grounds. As the shutdown continues, Junior and Keith patch up differences at the local bar. \"Sunshine\" is caught in a net as the \"Operation Moonbeam\" prank is executed.\n\nThe shutdown ends, and the fleet scrambles to get quotas, fuel, and hit the sea. In many ways, the season will have the feel of the old derby system, to get to the crab first, catch as many as you can, and deliver them in time for the early November holiday season deadlines.\n\nThe ''Cape Caution'' suddenly loses its starter when \"Wild\" Bill doesn't engage in the voodoo protection ritual brought on deck by the new greenhorn, and is the last to get out of Dutch Harbor. Bill completes the ritual and the quarter is tossed off-deck.\n\nThe first hour wraps up as the ''Time Bandit'', while setting pots, is boarded by a small boat crew from [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] cutter ''[[USCGC Waesche (WMSL-751)|Waesche]]'' for a spot safety gear inspection, despite a complete boat inspection prior to departure.\n\nHour 2 starts with ''Seabrooke'' finishing their initial string set. Junior's back injury hurts so much, he pulls the unusual for him [[modus operandi|M.O.]] of soaking his pots without spot checks\n\n''Wizard'' pulls their first pots after Keith engages in deckhand Freddy's cod blood ritual for good luck.\n\n''Northwestern'' pulls their first pots. Marine radio notifies the fleet than an automated EPIRB distress beacon has been received 60 nautical miles west of [[Adak Island|Adak]], registered to the fishing vessel ''Western Venture''. Sig says \"I'm pretty sure I know him. He's a little guy, he's only 59-foot. Not good!\" USCG dispatches helicopter 6005 and a C-130 for search-and-rescue operations. The C-130 arrives first, and verifies the boat is on fire, as well as verifying that the five-man crew is on board the life raft floating near-by. The rescue copter is a half-hour out, but the \"good Samaritan\" crab-fishing vessel ''Aleutian Beauty'' is closer, and they rescue the crew from the life raft.\n\nJunior is in so much pain, he has his relief captain Brad Petefish begin pulling pots. Brad lets Junior know they're seeing crab, and he returns mid-string, much better but still in pain.\n\n''Cape Caution'' finally arrives on the grounds and sets pots. On the ''Saga'', Elliott's first red king crab prospect string is a winner, and he sets the remainder of his pots there.\n\nThe weather radio broadcast forecasts 50-knot winds and 30-foot seas, further complicating the already short season. As the fleet powers through the storm, on the ''Cape Caution'', the greenhorn is falling behind and \"Wild\" Bill diagnoses he hasn't been eating enough. \n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=131\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Family Affair\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary=The episode opens with a voice-over by ''Cape Caution'' Captain \"Wild\" Bill Wichrowski and footage across the fleet from the episode: \"It's the old question: 'What does it take to make it on the Bering Sea?' On paper, a guy can look great: ex-Marine, commercial fisherman, sport fisherman\" (referring to his latest greenhorn's qualifications). The introduction concludes by switching to Bill in his Captain's chair saying \"You gotta be nuts to do this job.\"\n\nThe fleet is way behind schedule thanks to the government shutdown, as noted by the comments of the Captains, and a storm bearing down on the fleet makes that problem worse.\n\n''Cape Caution'''s lone greenhorn is still not 100%, but is needed to help with gear, and carelessly tosses a pot buoy into a crew member.\n\n''Seabrooke'' is pounded by waves as Junior wrestles with severe back pain, but the set-back string has great numbers, and sets back a third time.\n\n55-knot winds haven't done much to stop the ''Saga'', with 30,000 lbs in the tanks and a 38 crab-per-pot average, and the set-back string continues Captain Elliott's first red king season success until the numbers of keepers drops to singles.\n\nOn the ''Northwestern'', they have 100,000 lbs on board and look to top off the tanks. Before they haul the pots, Edgar must fix a sudden electrical problem with the mast-mounted lights. Edgar remounts two of the lights on the deck in the interim. As they haul pots, Captain Sig hears communications between a [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] rescue helicopter and the ''Blue Gadus'': \"I'm not sure who that is; I think that's a long-liner.\" 148 miles southwest, a ''Blue Gadus'' crewman has suffered a [[pulmonary embolism]] and requires medevac. which will be extremely difficult in the storm due to 30-foot seas and 100-knot winds. It takes two attempts to land the rescue basket on deck, but they complete the rescue. Sig comments how lucky the rescued guy is, that the copter rescued him before the worst of the storm caused them to abort the rescue.\n\nOn the ''Seabrooke'', Junior is looking to top off the tanks and go home. The third time through the string has very low numbers, and the weather radio broadcast forecasts 40-knot winds with 14-18-foot seas. Switching to later that night on the ''Time Bandit'', the forecast is for east 50-knot winds and 24-foot seas with fog and rain.\n\nOn the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith knows he's in for \"three-four days of bad weather, some of that hellaciously bad\", as he's already experiencing sustained 65-mph winds gusting to 80 and 90. As the brunt of the storm hits, the Captains are left to decide how much pain to endure before calling crews off the rails.\n\nOn the ''Time Bandit'', Captain Johnathan gives his son/deck boss Scott a pep talk before hauling pots. After a 29-hour soak, their pots come up with great numbers, but 25-foot swells are causing Axel (son of engineer Neal and nephew of Captains Johnathan and Andy) to have problems controlling the 800-lb pots. Scott and Axel have a cousin shouting match after a wave knocks Axel off balance and almost crushes him against the sorting table. Johnathan shuts down fishing before anyone gets hurt.\n\nWeather radio forecasts east 45 to southwest 50-knot winds, and Sig, Junior and Elliott also decide to shut down fishing until the worst passes. Only the ''Cape Caution'' is still fishing, and the new location of low numbers is not good, however the greenhorn is finally in the groove and the crew is working together as bigger numbers (and a big crab) arrive.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=132\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Darwin's Law\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|5|6}}\n |ShortSummary=A storm shut down the fleet, now an even more severe weather system hits them again.

Monte's initial good fortunes on the Bairdai grounds is soon thwarted when he discovers he has been fishing out of bounds in a protected area, and must discard everything he has caught.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=133\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title=On the Rocks\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|5|20}}\n |ShortSummary= As crews prepare to head to the Bairdi grounds, a mayday call from ''Arctic Hunter'' just outside Dutch Harbor prompts a dramatic at-sea rescue from the least likely heroes: Elliott and Mike Neese and the crew of the ''Saga''. While the ''Saga'' comes as close as they dare, the crew gets a scare when the underside of the hull smacks the bottom when it goes down with the waves, and back off a bit. With the ''Arctic Hunter'''s crew in their life raft, Mike and another deckhand swim out to the life raft and on the second try, successfully get a rope secured to it. The ''Saga'' tows them out of danger and gets the stranded crew aboard.\n\nOn the ''Cape Caution'', Bill's greenhorn Kelly is looking for a way off the boat by revealing that he has a pending arrest warrant hanging over him (for constructing an illegal firearm), and must return to shore for trial. Bill is not convinced by his story, and decides to call Kelly's bluff by contacting the authorities himself - who tell him that Kelly can finish his contractual obligations first. When offloading in Dutch, Bill delivers the bad news to Kelly, that he must return to sea to finish the season. On the ''Seabrooke'', Junior's back is troubling him and his crew convince him to head for shore. As boats complete their fishing, they see how badly the ''Arctic Hunter'' has been damaged by rocks and waves just days after running aground.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=134\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Falling Down\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|5|27}}\n |ShortSummary=Elliott's personal problems have caught up with him again and ''Saga'' is stuck in the harbor.

On the ''Northwestern'', an engine problem leaves the ship in the dark and Jake must step up to fix the problem.

The ''Cape Caution'' completes its Bairdai season, and Captain Bill summarily fires Kelly, who leaves Dutch knowing he is facing imprisonment when he returns to Alabama.

Josh stops the truck and gets out about half-way through what the aeral pull back reveals to be the crab pot stacks, and as the pull back finishes we see the entire port side of the CM at dock before the opening credits. (The episode title is taken from Josh's line about \"betting it all on blue, ''Cornelia Marie'' blue\" from late in season 9).\n\nAs footage of all the usual suspects preparing their boats for 2014 Opilio season rolls, Mike Rowe's voice over: \"on the line: $32 million in Bering Sea bounty\". This time, however, there are several twists.\n\nTwist 1: We see more footage of Josh driving to the dock, reflecting on his father, as he has finally bought controlling interest in the family business, and the next aerial shot comes up over a pot stack to see the starboard side of the CM, tower lights blazing. As Josh walks on deck, we switch to the wheelhouse to meet long-time Harris family friend, co-captain/engineer Casey McManus. Prepping crab pots not used since 2011 is a significant challenge, as is having the youngest crew in the fleet, including Josh's high school classmate (and ''[[Bering Sea Gold]]'' digger) Cody Moen. Before they set sail, ''Time Bandit'' Captains Andy and Johnathan present Josh with a black [[hoodie]] saying \"I'm the S. H. I. T.\" on front, and \"S.kipper H.arris I.n T.raining\" on back.\n\nTwist 2: Elliott returns from rehab, and receives a surprise visit and encouragement from fellow recovering addict Edgar Hansen as ''Saga'' preps for Opilio season, with one of the rescued ''Arctic Hunter'' deckhands replacing Elliott's dad on deck.\n\nTwist 3: 18-year-old Mandy Hansen spends her winter high school break with her father (Sig), and tries to convince him to take her crab fishing on the ''Northwestern'' (including footage from last summer's salmon tendering from the \"Legend of the ''Northwestern''\" special); Sig has her do emergency drills and prep pots with the other deckhands before sending her home to get her mother's permission to go crabbing.\n\nTwist 4: ''Seabrooke'' is still in port as Junior recovers from spinal fusion surgery in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]].\n\nTwist 5: ''Time Bandit'' leaves port without Johnathan in the second seat, who is taking advice from the doctor to lower his blood pressure.\n\nTwist 6: ''Cape Caution'''s latest new greenhorn was hired by... Zack! Wild Bill always seems to pick bad ones, especially the last one from king season, so this time he let his son choose one.\n\nMandy and Johnathan return to Seattle as the fleet heads out to sea and begins setting pots.\n\nCasey watches as Josh sets his first prospect string on the ''Cornelia Marie'', and refutes Derrick Ray's comment from 3 years ago about Phil doing them a disservice by not teaching them how to run the boat, because they were not ready to learn how then.\n\nAs they are setting pots, ''Northwestern'' loses the starboard rudder control due to a cracked solenoid. Edgar gives Sig part information, and Sig calls around the fleet for possible replacements. The closest potential spare, much to Jake's dismay, is on the ''Kiska Sea'', and the ships pull close to transfer the part. Edgar discovers the part is incompatible. Until a fix is done, Jake Anderson will steer using the old manual ship's wheel while Sig runs the throttle. Edgar, calling on years of [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]-ing experience, resorts to his grinder and some industrial-grade epoxy to repair the solenoid, restoring full rudder control for the moment as they resume setting pots.\n\nOn the ''Cornelia Marie'', Josh takes the \"in training\" part seriously, while clips of Derrick and Phil play, as he decides to watch how Casey pulls pots in 45-50-knot winds and 20-foot seas before risking his crew when he does it.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=137\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=Skipper Harris in Training\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|6|17}}\n |ShortSummary=The introduction previews Captain Keith's gamble on the icy northern edge of the fishing grounds near the [[Russia]]n border, with Russian transmissions on the marine sideband radio.\n\nPicking up where the previous episode left off, ''Cornelia Marie'' pulls its first Opilio pots since 2011, and the entire prospect string for Captains Josh and Casey comes up blanks, a first for any Josh-set string. Josh gives the crew a pep talk before they head off for hopefully better fishing.\n\nOn the ''Cape Caution'', they pull their first pots and the numbers are good, and Captain Wild Bill is counting on Zack and Nick to keep the new greenhorn working.\n\nCaptain Keith braves the northern edge of the fishing grounds with the ''Wizard'', and a storm has prevented the crew from performing normal ice control measures. 12 hours from his desired grounds, the helm's sluggish response prompts Keith to get the crew out to knock out 50,000-80,000 pounds of 4-foot-thick ice and drop pots early to reduce the weight on deck, with Keith vowing \"this will never happen again on my watch\".\n\nBack on the ''Cape Caution'', Bill sets back pots on good numbers until a pot being pulled up hits off the side of the boat and smacks the new greenhorn square on the nose, breaking it. [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] Zack controls the bleeding, but the injury requires stitches, and Bill is uncomfortable stitching somebody's face. Bill suggests steri-stripping with gauze over the top and Zack applies the strips to immobilize the nose.\n\nOn the ''Northwestern'', Captain Sig hits a hot string in bad seas, and the crew takes a chow break between strings. Matt informs Sig that the electrical breaker panel is \"hot, hot\" to the touch. Sig calls Edgar in to find the problem. With all the new electronics and hydraulics added in recent years, boat electrical systems like ''Northwestern'''s are past their design limits. Once again, Jake will have to use the manual ship's wheel to steer while Edgar works on the panel. Edgar trims the crusty part of a panel wire to reveal good wire, reattaches it to the panel, and successfully powers up the wheelhouse. Their next string is continuing good numbers when Sig gets a call from his wife, informing him she actually has given their daughter Mandy her permission to go crab fishing. Sig never expected his wife would ever do that. \"Me and my big mouth, huh?\"\n\nBack on the ''Wizard'', they pull pots, and Keith's gamble pays off big time as pot after pot fills up the tank with keepers. \"That was the longest five days of my fishing career.

He threatens to punch him, and tells him their conversation was captain to crewman, not father to son.\nOn the ''Northwestern'', Sig's daughter Mandy has to be awakened to get to work. The other crew members offer commentary about that. She begins to experience life as a greenhorn. Sig's fatherly protectiveness kicks in. And he goes on deck to show her how it's done.

The ''Wizard'' is too far north to get back in time, but Captain Keith pipes the radio commentary onto the deck whilst his crew work on. Despite poor fishing, Casey and Josh decide to take the ''Cornelia Marie'' back to port in treacherous waters to make the game - Josh says he will \"swim if he has to\".

Sig orders a 30-hour grind to test where Mandy's breaking point will be. On the ''Saga'', Elliot's patience with his crew is tested, when they rebel against his orders to use containers to manually transport the crab to the rear tanks, and end up breaking the crab table in protest.

Captain Andy has run out of time owing to commitments back onshore, and calls on brother Jonathan to finish Opilio season for him once the boat is repaired. After the ''Northwestern'' finishes its first trip with Mandy Hansen as greenhorn, Sig drives her to the airport for her flight home to Seattle, but he fails to convince her that there are easier ways to make a living than crab fishing. Meanwhile on the ''Cape Caution'', Captain \"Wild\" Bill is on the verge of finishing his season, but at the eleventh hour is given more quota by the boat's owners. He makes the decision to extend the trip to increase the potential haul, but the greenhorn decides to deliberately waste the boat's scant supply of bait in an attempt cut the season short, but Bill quickly realizes what is going on and confronts him over the issue. On the ''Wizard'', Captain Keith is still pulling large numbers in the far north of the fishing grounds, but his run of good luck is finally broken when a pot snares on the vessel's propeller, badly damaging it - but it remains serviceable. The ''Cornelia Marie'' is also getting close to finishing the season, but Captain Casey has to confront his crew over insubordination. After a pep talk from Casey and with Josh Harris returning to the deck to boost morale, the vessel finishes its first Opilio season with Josh as owner, meeting its first quota handsomely. Whilst the crew are doing their unload, another fisherman presents Josh with a stray pot buoy that has washed up on shore - it turns out that it is from the same crab pot that the crew of the ''Wizard'' deliberately sunk three years ago in memorial to his late father Phil. Captain Keith reckons that it is a message from Phil to Josh to keep pressing on with his ambition to eventually captain the ''Corneila Marie''.\n\nThe other captains comment on Josh's first season, saying that he would have made Phil proud, but also that he still has a lot of learning to do before he can become a skipper himself.\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=144\n |EpisodeNumber2=16\n |Title=You'll Know My Name Is The Lord...\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|8|5}}\n |ShortSummary=(2-hour Season Finale)\n |LineColor=665638\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 11 (2015) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=7% | No. in<br />series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=7% | No. in<br />season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #A4273E; color: #FFFFFF;\" width=20% | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=145\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=A Brotherhood Tested\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|4|14}}\n |ShortSummary=A 12-million pound Bairdi quota increase causes a fishing frenzy; a boat is stolen on the eve of a launch; an alliance takes root.\n |LineColor=A4273E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=146\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=Prodigal Son\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|4|21}}\n |ShortSummary=An additional 15 million dollars in crab sends the fleet into a fishing frenzy.

Discussion topics: \"Old vs. Young\" (old guys staying in the game vs. new guys like Elliott and Junior); \"Sibling Rivalries\" among the Hansen, Hillstrand and Colburn brothers about sharing the helm (with guest Captain/deck boss Edgar); \"Where We Left Off\" (recapping Season 8's slashed quotas and early descending ice pack); \"The Off Season\" (what the Captains did for fun or work between seasons, including the ''Time Bandit'' engine and hull upgrades); \"Wild Bill\" the weatherman for ''The Bait'', and also fired by the ''Kodiak'''s owners after Season 8 for losing crab pots due to the early descending ice pack; \"The Josh Harris Situation\": Johnathan and Andy interview Josh about the situation with him, his brother Jake, and three years of frustration trying to purchase the ''Cornelia Marie'' (with flashbacks from ''After the Catch IV'' and ''After the Catch VI'').\n\nRegular feature \"The Hot Seat\" debuts with Sig interviewing Elliott the dad; Keith interviewing Elliott the Captain (with guest appearance by Executive Producer Jeff Conroy showing time-coded tape of events that led to Elliott being fired from the ''Ramblin' Rose'') and previewing Elliott's new purchase, the ''Saga'' (last seen in Season 1); and Andy interviewing Junior about his \"legend-ary\" Season 8 and previews of Season 9 troubles he'll have with Keith.\n\n\"Boat Tour\": Johnathan is pranked by Keith and Monte after touring the ''Wizard''; Wild Bill shows Edgar his new ride, the ''Cape Caution'', which required a lot of repairs by the owners to put it in service again on short notice.

So before tonight's new episode, the Captains are set to hash it out and crank you up.\"\n\nContinuing on last week's old vs. young theme, they talk about how captains typically took five years or longer (and presumed past age 30) to go from working a deck to the wheelhouse, and many young guys, like Josh Harris and Jake Anderson are trying to get there before age 30, as well as Edgar wanting a crack at captaining ''Northwestern'' for Blue King Crab season. And as highlights from the episode air, Edgar reminds viewers that the \"SH\" letters on the vessel's shield \"do not stand for Sig Hansen\" (they stand for Sverre Hansen, their father); Wild Bill trying to educate his son Zack in a hurry on how to fish crab; Junior and Elliott trying to catch blues.\n\nFirst up, \"The Saga Saga\": The Captains interview Elliott, and Sig reveals he didn't even know the boat was still functional, followed by Elliott giving Edgar the \"Boat Tour\". Back in studio, they talk about how ''Saga'' hasn't fished in eight years, and Elliott also mentions the Season 1 man overboard of Kevin \"Kado\" Davis (later one of Elliott's ''Ramblin' Rose'' deckhands) when he was working on the ''Saga''. \"Alliances\": Sig, Johnathan, Keith and Elliott confront Junior about how he does alliances.\n\n\"Edgar vs. Sig\": Using footage from the \"Revelations\" special and \"Mutiny on the Bering Sea\", we see why Edgar has had an uphill fight with Sig to learn the wheelhouse side of the family business, as Keith sits inbetween the brothers for the interview. \"Boat Tour\": Sig gives Zack a tour of the ''Northwestern''.\n\n\"The ''Cape Caution''\": The Captains interview Wild Bill, commending his ability to pull his new ship out of mothballs and have it catching crab in a very short time, and reviewing adventures of the father/son deck hand duo of Kirby and Mikey Mitchell.\n\nCelebrity questions from [[NASCAR]] racer [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], answered by Wild Bill in person at the race track. Johnathan, captain/children's book author, reads to kids at the Unalaska library.\n\n\"The Hot Seat\": Sig interviews Josh Harris and Johnathan about Jake Harris' problems, and Josh's efforts to procure the ''Cornelia Marie'', and Josh announces he is going to be a father; Sig interviews Andy, who is keeping a close eye on his brother's health, in the wake of Johnathan breaking his ribs TWICE inbetween 2012 Opilio and King Crab seasons, the first was bull riding caught on tape for ''After the Catch VI'' and the second in a motorcycle accident while the boat was being repaired (as seen in the \"Legend of the Time Bandit\" special).\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Opilio Kicks Off\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|4}}\n |ShortSummary=Before the Captains kick off a 2013 Opilio season that may prove to be just as icy and nasty as 2012 Opilio season was, they have to tie up the loose ends from 2012 King Crab season.\n\nFirst up, \"Captain Edgar's Blue Crab\": Despite Sig's reservations, he let Edgar take the helm for blues. Edgar fixed a failed part, caught their quota AND defused a reprise of the Season 4 fight between deck hands Jake Anderson and Matt Bradley; Matt joins Sig, Edgar and Keith to discuss the aftermath. Jake left after kings to pursue an opportunity to captain the ''Kiska Sea''.\n\nJohnathan and Andy give a quick \"Opilio Geography\" lesson on where the fishing grounds are. Mike Rowe and ''Time Bandit'' deckhand Mike Fourtner describe \"Dutch Harbor Bunker Hill\", from its [[World War II]] days as an Army base with Fourtner giving the physical tour. The Captains sing \"Bill's Blues\" with Wild Bill, going too far north and low numbers on blues until late in the season.\n\nThe Captains put Elliott in \"The Hot Seat\" to talk about his first season as a boat owner, and what it will take to start turning profits; then they add Junior to the discussion as they square off over their blue \"alliance\"; then they talk about being sons of crab fisherman, and Scott Sr.'s near-fatal accident that cut short Junior's king season. Also in \"The Hot Seat\" (again) is Josh Harris, still working on the ''Time Bandit'' as he works to procure the ''Cornelia Marie'', and will be given the graduation boot by the Hillstrands at the end of the season.\n\nCelebrity studio visit and question by [[Meat Loaf]]. Keith and Lenny show us \"Dutch Harbor's Deadliest Church\", the iconic 1825 [[Russian Orthodox]] church shown in the ''Deadliest Catch'' opening credits and Keith rings the bells installed in 1894. As ''Wizard'' prepares to sail with yet another greenhorn deckhand, the Captains discuss Keith's reputation as \"The Greenhorn Slayer\", with Executive Producer Jeff Conroy adding \"cameraman slayer\" to Keith's reputation over footage he had reviewed on the day this episode was taped.\n\nThe first ever \"''The Bait'' Exclusive\" (footage not aired on ''Deadliest Catch'' or ''On Deck'') shows ''Wizard'' being pummeled by a massive [[rogue wave]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Fouled By Weather\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|6|25}}\n |ShortSummary=Opening with scenes depicting Opilio fishing described in Mike Rowe's introduction as \"fouled by weather\", the Captains and crews are having some anger management issues over another very bad Opilio weather season, especially Zack and crew on the ''Cape Caution'', a deckhand fight on the ''Wizard'' and Captain Andy and the ''Time Bandit'' crew of veteran deckhands.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\", the ''Time Bandit'' crew, represented first by Josh Harris then by deck boss Mike Fourtner discussing the lack of bait (Axel's job) and Andy missing a double-rogue wave call that endangered the crew and sent a pot overboard. What likely saved the crew was their \"sea wall\", a high section of railing that crew can duck behind, as Junior demonstrates on ''Seabrooke'' where his rails were before the season, and where they are now after installing the sea walls.\n\nWild Bill delivers a typical rainy Seattle weather report, with Edgar providing the garden hose rainfall. Back in studio, the Captains and Wild Bill discuss lousy fishing, Mikey having a new girlfriend back in Oregon, and Zack berating the old man for the bad numbers. During a break in taping, Johnathan and Andy try to poach Zack from Wild Bill until Bill sees what's going on.\n\nCelebrity questions from [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Chad Smith]]. Their musical and community appreciation is shown with footage from \"The Captains' Concert\" at the [[SXSW]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. When asked by a local reporter what kind of music they listen to on deck, Sig and Johnathan tell him no music, because they need to be able to communicate, which leads into a discussion back in studio about \"Distractions at Sea\", led by Elliott's boom box drowning out a rogue wave much like the one Andy missed.\n\nNext up in \"The Hot Seat\": Elliott, discussing his personal problems and their effect on the ''Saga'' crew. Junior provides an update on his father being past the critical stage and recovering, and facing a two-week delay in the start of his Opilio season heading into a descending ice pack driving the rest of the fleet south as he heads north.\n\nNext in \"The Hot Seat\": Jake Anderson makes his debut on ''The Bait'', facing Sig and Edgar again, and also discussing the Seattle/Oregon rivalry when the ''Kiska Sea'' crew resents a Seattle kid potentially running the boat. \"Sunshine\", Jake's replacement on ''Northwestern'' also appears.\n\nSpecial guest C. J. Cutter from ''[[Blood and Oil]]'' visits the set and previews an episode of that Discovery series. Lenny and the Captains discuss Freddy's fight with the ''Wizard'''s greenhorn.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title=Iced Over\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|16}}\n |ShortSummary=The episode opens with the Captains talking about the previous week's ''Deadliest Catch'' episode, where boats came in to port at St. Paul Island to offload crab after battling the fast-descending ice pack and mechanical problems; and previews of that night's episode returning to see who lost gear, who caught crab, Wild Bill fixing a mechanical problem at sea, and ''Wizard'' hit by a rogue wave. They also discuss how the ice problems throw off delivery schedules and potential loss of crab, pots and money if the gear goes off the edge into deeper water without enough line to the buoys.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\": Keith, since at this point in 2013 Opilio season, he's the only one \"on the crab\" and he's in a race to pull his gear before the ice claims any pots. Then the other Captains add fuel to the fire by bringing in ''Wizard'''s oldest deckhand, Lenny, and Edgar to discuss insubordination, and how older crew like Lenny can give a \"smooth f--- off\" to Monte and get away with it because of his tenure, when greenhorns like Dane cannot. As they discuss how one greenhorn being confined to quarters can flip control of a deck, Keith asks \"Can I get out of this seat sometime soon?\" as they show the rogue wave compounding Keith's problems.\n\nJohnathan tries his hand at captaining a Seattle police boat on [[Lake Washington]].\n\nNext up in \"The Hot Seat\": Elliott joins the Captains as they discuss how insubordinate ''Saga'''s crew is towards him; followed by Junior, who is making up for lost time by fishing in dangerous conditions, turning a planned quick 48-hour trip into a 12-day adventure.\n\nCelebrity questions from actor [[Tom Green]].\n\nWild Bill is next to sit in \"The Hot Seat\", talking about his challenges teaching son Zack the ropes of fishing, including insubordination; Zack joins the discussion. Then they discuss the early departure of engineer Kirby Mitchell while Bill was repairing hydraulic lines on the ''Cape Caution''.\n\nWild Bill and Zack do some indoor skydiving on a break, experiencing 120-knot winds without the seaborne elements like salt or jellyfish.\n\nA new special feature, \"Fourtner Finds Out\" debuts, as ''Time Bandit'' deck boss Mike Fourtner finds out how hydraulics on a crab boat work, in response to Tom Green's second question. (The facility where the demo is performed serviced the cranes on both ''Time Bandit'' and ''Northwestern''.) Footage from ''Time Bandit'''s hydraulic pump failure from the previous week's episode is shown.\n\nAll three Hansen brothers revisit their auto shop teacher at Shorewood High School, recounting how lessons learned in shop class saved their lives at sea.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |Title=Hail Mary\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|23}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains start by discussing strategies for dealing with unexpected events, in a season where all the worst elements came together: injuries, breakdowns, bad fishing, bad waves, and bad ice.\n\nWhile talking about bad waves, \"Fourtner Finds Out\" exactly what a rogue wave is at the [[NOAA]] Western Regional Center in Seattle.\n\n\"Battling the Ice\": Junior and the Captains discuss how the ice was a game-changer in how they fished, and that the best ice strategy is to stay out of it; and how the top layer \"suitcases\" of pots with the buoys and lines still tied inside can be shed at a loss, if necessary, to save a boat.\n\n\"Seattle\": Keith shows how boats beat up by the ice get repaired and reprovisioned in Seattle at much lower costs than up in Alaska.\n\nWild Bill delivers a sunny weather report, while talking about how two \"kids\" in Elliott and Jake Anderson are trying to run crab boats, and will learn \"being a boat captain, it ain't kid stuff\".\n\nFirst in \"The Hot Seat\" is Jake Anderson, discussing how he left ''Northwestern'' only for an opportunity to captain a boat, not likely to happen soon there with Edgar and Norm Hansen already in line, and getting more information than helm time on the ''Kiska Sea''.\n\nNext in \"The Hot Seat\" is Elliott, discussing why he let his bad-mouthing engineer go, with Keith commenting how it takes time for a young captain to build a good crew, and how he still has problems with new greenhorns; then they discuss a really unusual unexpected problem: sand fleas that eat bait and crab, and using squid in their bait to eliminate the problem.\n\nJunior joins Sig, Andy and Keith to discuss how \"Junior's Hot Fishing\" spot came from the Colonel (Scott Sr.) and adopting his fishing techniques, as well.\n\nCelebrity questions from New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]].\n\nWild Bill and Zack join the Captains to discuss how Bill had to repair the crane on a boat that hadn't fished in a while, and how that helped the relationship with Zack.\n\nSig answers a fan question about girls on the boat, and we see the first pictures of his daughter Mandy on deck during summer tendering, with Johnathan telling Sig he'd love to see her fishing king crab, and Andy saying \"Women are not built for that job.\" for winter opilio fishing. Footage of Mandy and Matt Bradley on deck during tendering is shown as Johnathan explains what tendering is.\n\nAfter Sig answers a third question from Andrew Cuomo regarding having challenging younger brothers in the family business, Edgar joins Sig and Andy to discuss being \"Back on Deck\" after a successful Blue Crab season in the wheelhouse, and previews a short-of-quota Sig offering Edgar a chance to run the boat for an Opilio trip.\n\nJohnathan demonstrates how heavy those 800-lb crab pots are by squashing a squash and a melon with one.\n\nIn \"Crabbers Gone Wild\", we see how the end of the season drives the crews crazy. Wild Bill joins the discussion, and Keith previews the craziest thing he's even seen as Freddy jumps overboard to help harness a walrus carcass.\n\n[[Mike Rowe]] makes his first on-camera appearance on ''The Bait'' at the end of the episode when Johnathan says \"Who needs Mike Rowe?\", as the Captains' timing for the start of that night's ''Deadliest Catch'' episode is off by a few seconds.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=7\n |Title=The Home Stretch\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|7|30}}\n |ShortSummary=The Captains begin the episode by entering the home stretch: previews of the 2-hour Season 9 finale, which continue the theme of the season, old vs. young.\n\nIn \"Boat by Boat\" segments, we get a look at the future of each boat. First up, ''Time Bandit'' and the departure of two seasoned deckhands.\n\nLanding first in \"The Hot Seat\" is Josh Harris, who announces to a toast of Coors (instead of \"duck farts\") that he has purchased the ''Cornelia Marie''. Josh plans on having a co-captain for at least one season, maybe two, after seeing what ''Time Bandit'' endured during Season 9, and Freddy on deck (Freddy promised to return if Josh ever ran the boat). Joining him is ''Time Bandit'' deck boss Mike Fourtner, retiring after 15 seasons due to expecting twins with his wife.\n\nKeith gives a shout out to the men and women who protect their livelihood: the [[United States Coast Guard]].\n\nWild Bill catches a fish in [[Pike Place Market]] because the previous week, he was chewed out for not being able to catch crab, which Sig also had problems with last week.\n\nThe ''Northwestern'' \"Boat by Boat\" update starts with Sig offering Edgar the boat for the end of Opilio season, and continues with Sig finally sitting in \"The Hot Seat\", questioned by Wild Bill, Johnathan, Edgar, Andy and Keith, discussing the drama from the start of the season over blue quota, and Sig trying to apologize for underestimating Edgar's abilities. They also discuss Jake Anderson's decision to leave, and Sig interviews Jake at Sig's house.\n\n\"Boat by Boat\": Elliott is taking care of ''Saga'' business in [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], so is not able to defend himself for appearing \"disrespectful\" to older captains for doubting his ability to catch crab; and on ''Seabrooke'', Junior's alliances and bad news from home caused much grief. With Andy and Sig looking on, Junior confronts Keith about his perceived wrong to him, and walks off the set before violence erupts.\n\nAfter a break, Johnathan and Wild Bill return on set as \"Boat by Boat\" views the ''Wizard'''s crazy season, topped off by the crazy interview that just finished.\n\nCelebrity questions from none other than narrator [[Mike Rowe]].\n\n\"Boat by Boat\" updates wrap up with ''Cape Caution'''s bad fishing, breakdowns, and family drama.\n\nConcluding the \"old vs. young\" theme, Jake says to Sig that the younger ones, especially the sons of fishermen like Josh Harris and Scotty Hillstrand aren't pushing the bar, they're trying to keep up with the progress their fathers made at those points in life.\n\nEdgar, Mike Fourtner, Junior and Josh join the Captains on camera to wrap up the season, Edgar and Mike bringing in a TV to watch the season finale.\n}}\n|}\n\n==== ''The Bait'' 2 ====\n\nThe catch phrase for ''The Bait'' 2 is \"You can't catch crab without ''The Bait''.\"\n\nEpisode 6 filmed at Harlem Yacht Club in [[City Island, New York]]; Episodes 7-10 filmed at [[Mercer Island]] VFW near [[Seattle]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| # !!

Keith would not have gone as far north nor let so much ice build up; Andy wished he had caught his hydraulic leak sooner, leading into a previews of do-over wishes from that night's episode on the ''Cape Caution'', ''Time Bandit'', and ''Cornelia Marie'' and recaps of the ''Wizard'' and ''Cornelia Marie'' injuries from a few weeks earlier.\n\nFirst up in \"The Hot Seat\" is Josh, talking about the rough start fishing and with the rigging in the loaner pots not properly prepared. Josh and Sig have a vigorous discussion about apologizing for a crewman getting slammed by bad seas, and how Josh restored morale with the ''Cornelia Marie'''s favorite ritual, the mohawk. \"10 Years of Catch\" shows the first mohawks from Season 4 and last week's bring-back.\n\nSpeaking of rituals, previews of that night's episode show how the fleet got ready to root for the Seahawks in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] as Josh and the Captains dig into burgers from episode sponsor [[Carl's Jr.]]/[[Hardee's]] before going to break.\n\nWild Bill sits in for Johnathan as they roll out \"Best of Catch\" Poll: Oddest Rituals, which features a Season 10 clip in a poll for the first time (Norman Hansen chowing down on the herring). They then discuss one of the oldest sailor's superstitions about having women on a boat being bad luck, yet Sig brought daughter Mandy out to sea, and she's next up in \"The Hot Seat\", talking about her herring ritual and getting flamed when napping too long between strings.\n\nAs they start to talk about Mandy getting preferential treatment as Captain Sig's daughter, Uncle Edgar and the rest of the ''Northwestern'' crew (sans Uncle Norman) commandeer the set to do just that, as Sig replaces Mandy in \"The Hot Seat\".\n\nAs Sig reclaims his normal chair and the rest of the Captains return, Elliott is next on set, as footage from his rookie year in Season 7 is shown, and he discusses his four years on the show to date. They then discuss Elliott bringing his girlfriend on deck as the ''Saga'''s cook (not unprecedented, since ''Maverick'' had Captain Rick Quashnick's wife, Donna, as cook back in Season 1).\n\nSpeaking of young Captains, we finally get an update on Junior, six weeks after back surgery, and in a humorous clip, \"Junior Done?\", we see what Junior might be doing if he doesn't return for crab fishing next year, like drive a New York Water Taxi.\n\nWild Bill is still filling in as discussion turns to Zack and the ''Cape Caution'', and Zack is next up in \"The Hot Seat\", discussing the previous episode's bilge alarm. In \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike visits the ''Northwestern'', docked in Seattle, to demonstrate why it's imperative for a boat to pump its bilge regularly.\n\nJohnathan rejoins Wild Bill and the Captains as the second half of the poll rituals are reviewed (including another Season 10 clip, the ''Northwestern'''s flaming hook). In a second edition of \"The Fourtner Report\", Mike answers Wild Bill and Andy's question if those rituals really work. Wild Bill and the Captains chow down on cheeseburgers to close the episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |Title=The Red Zone\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|7|29}}\n |ShortSummary=\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |Title=Touchdown\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|8|5}}\n |ShortSummary=\n}}\n|}\n\n=== ''On Deck'' ===\nIn the ninth season in 2013, Discovery continued the trend of expanded show notes and unaired scenes in its series with ''Deadliest Catch: On Deck''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2881230/|title=Deadliest Catch: On Deck|accessdate=19 March 2019|website=IMDb.com}}</ref> ''On Deck'' episode titles are the same as the ''Deadliest Catch'' episode they expand on.\n\n==== ''On Deck'' 1 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| # !!

In Britain, teachers, imams, politicians, social workers and families must not protect intolerance, but reject it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/ed-husain-british-muslims-must-reject-intolerance-to-defy-extremists-a3547151.html|title=Ed Husain: British Muslims must reject intolerance to defy extremists|date=24 May 2017|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Middle East Federation ===\nHusain has called for a federal union of Middle Eastern states along the lines of the [[European Union]] in order to defeat religious sectarianism in the region and promote economic and political cooperation.\n\nHe writes:<blockquote>After all, most of its problems \u2013 terrorism, poverty, unemployment, sectarianism, refugee crises, water shortages \u2013 require regional answers.

Though critical of Saudi Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman|Mohammed bin Salman]], Husain has written in favour of western, and specifically British, support for his early steps towards reform in order to 'shape the future of a global shift towards peace and co-existence' between the Middle East and the west.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/britain-should-not-turn-its-back-on-mbs-and-the-saudis/|title=Britain should not turn its back on MBS and the Saudis|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=2018|website=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\n=== Jeremy Corbyn ===\nHusain has accused British MP and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of 'pitting Britain's Muslims against its Jews' in his struggle for political power against the Conservatives. Not only has Corbyn launched a calculated attack on the Conservatives in the name of Islam to secure the 'Muslim' vote, Husain argues, his proclamations of friendship with Hamas and Hezbollah 'combined with the hard-Left's hatred for America and capitalism made Islamists and Leftists a coalition against the Conservatives'. \u00a0\n\nHusain has called for the removal of this 'racism of low expectations and collectivism' within the Labour leadership, which he argues views the diversity of British Muslims as a single bloc of votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/06/06/jeremy-corbyn-pitting-britains-muslims-against-jews/|title=Jeremy Corbyn is pitting Britain's Muslims against Jews|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=2018|website=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n=== Bahrain ===\nIn an op-ed for the ''New York Times'' in 2012, Husain analysed the political unrest in Bahrain in the wake of the Arab Spring after a visit to the reforming Crown Prince [[Salman, Crown Prince of Bahrain|Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa]]. Noting the strong influence of the pro-Iran, anti-democracy cleric Ayatollah [[Isa Qassim|Issa Qasim]] on the Shiite opposition party [[Al Wefaq]] (which blocked bills for women's rights and equality that were supported by both the monarchy and Sunni parties), Husain urged the West not to \"not provide diplomatic cover for rioters and clerics in the name of human rights and democracy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/opinion/the-prince-and-the-ayatollah.html|title=The Prince and the Ayatollah|last=Husain|first=Ed|website=NYT}}</ref> \u00a0\n\nHe called Bahrain a 'focal point of what is happening in the Middle East today \u2013 the battle to find a balance between preserving the best values of the Islamic tradition while the region eases its way into the modern world.'\n\n=== Israel and Palestine ===\nHusain supports a [[two-state solution]] to end the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]]. He has condemned the suicide bombing of Israeli civilians as well as the \"killing of Palestinian civilians by the Hamas-led Gazan government\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/27/withgodontheirside|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|title=With God on their side?|first=Ed|last=Husain|date=27 June 2007|access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe is opposed to the international [[boycott of Israel]] by activists, stating in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that:\n{{quote|Many people condemn Israeli settlements and call for an economic boycott of their produce, but I saw that it was Arab builders, plumbers, taxi drivers and other workers who maintained Israeli lifestyles.

He has urged western governments to take on a deeper understanding of its extremist worldview, arguing:\n<blockquote>Unless we decimate the theological and ideological appeal of Isis, we will see the rise of an even more radicalised and violent force. Isis offers a caliphate and death. Our message needs to be of life, an Islam of the Muslim majority supported by 1,400 years of history. We must help Arab allies to reform, to create a regional Middle East union that transcends artificial borders, creates economic prosperity and reinstates Arab dignity. Terrorists cannot compete on this stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/624d8d48-603e-11e4-88d1-00144feabdc0|title=Until we understand Isis, we cannot hope to defeat it|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=30 October 2014|website=Financial Times}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== U.S. response to the Arab Spring ===\nOn the [[Arab Spring]], he has said:\n<blockquote>\nThe Arab world is no longer across the oceans. It is also on our streets here. Millions of American citizens are of Arab descent. Millions more are here as workers and students. What happens over there matters here. Can America make these people proud and empower them against Muslim extremists by changing the American story and making us all safer? Yes, it can. It must.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012805611.html \"How Should the U.S. Respond to the Protests in the Middle East?\"], Ed Husain, ''Washington Post''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHusain advocates American soft power and leadership in modelling democracy. Countering the US response to the Egyptian military's raiding of NGO offices in 2012, he said:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe U.S. government should ask its military allies to return to their barracks and cease killing protesters\u2014and that it should tie these demands to U.S. aid. ... The Arab revolutionaries did not look to China or Russia for a model of government. They looked to four-year presidential terms, inspired directly by American democracy. Islamist leaders such as Tunisia's Mohamed Ghannouchi condemn French secularism but highlight American accommodation of religion as a model of a secular state that is less hostile to religion.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203718504577178600154964904 \"Egypt's Revolt and the American Model\"], ''The Wall Street Journal''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Husain argued against U.S. military intervention in Syria, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat happens in Syria does not stay in Syria. ... U.S. military intervention in Syria would likely see traditional state actors backing rival groups (Sunnis and Muslim Brotherhood by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for example, Shia and Alawites by Iran, Druze and Christians by France, a former colonial master, or even indirectly Israel). Worse, there is a real possibility of the emergence of an al-Qaeda-inspired organization inside Syria to fight \"Western imperialism,\" much like al-Qaeda or the \"Sunni insurgency\" in Iraq.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/we-intervene-in-syria-at-our-peril/252335/ \"We Intervene in Syria at Our Peril\"], ''The Atlantic''</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Al-Qaeda ===\nIn a May 2011 op-ed in ''[[The Times]]'', Husain warned against [[al-Qaeda]]'s success as a brand:\n<blockquote>\nWithout doubt, the US was right to remove bin Laden, but it is wrong to think that his death will weaken al-Qaeda. Yes, a colossal psychological blow has been dealt, but al-Qaeda is no longer a mere organisation, but a global brand, an idea, a philosophy that now has its first Saudi martyr from the holy lands of Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/bin-laden-more-dangerous-dead-than-alive/p24891],|title=''The Times'', \"Bin Laden is More Dangerous Dead than Alive\"|website=cfr.org|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Husain criticized the September 2011 extrajudicial killing of American citizen [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], explaining that it is \"counterproductive to defeating terrorism in the long term because it demolishes the very values that America stands for: the rule of law and trial by jury.\" Furthermore, \"An easier, cheaper and more effective way of discrediting al-Awlaki and countering his message would have been to disclose his three arrests for the solicitation of prostitutes ...\"<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/30/opinion/husain-awlaki- killing/index.html], CNN, \"U.S. Shouldn't Have Killed al-Awlaki\"</ref>\n\n=== Syrian Civil War ===\nHusain has warned of the involvement of Al-Qaeda and like minded groups in the Syrian Civil War:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhether Assad stays or goes, jihadism now has a strong foothold in Syria. The Free Syrian Army may wish to dismiss its al-Qaeda allies as irrelevant in order to reassure the West and continue receiving Western support, but the jihadi websites and footage of al-Qaeda fighting in Damascus and Aleppo tell a different story.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/314685/syria-why-al-qaeda-winning-ed-husain] National Review \"Syria: Why al-Qaeda is

And individual can remain a firm believer, a ''mutadayyin'', without the ''[[imam]]'' and the ''jama'ah''.<ref>[http://www.deenport.com/iframes/viewtopic.php?topicurl=viewtopic.php? t=16081&sid=cc0c39864624f4449f8bbce6b817570f Ed Husain Questions ]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (online Q&A)</ref></blockquote>He believes that is Islam is fully compatible with Western democratic society, stating that the Quran does not teach a compulsion to faith or the murder of unbelievers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/opinions/how-to-fight-islamist-terror-ed-husain-opinion/index.html|title=How Islamist terror can be defeated|last=Husain|first=Ed|website=CNN|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> Husain has espoused this view in numerous commentaries, articles, and books, stating: <blockquote>\u2026 the lived reality of Islam as a religion of compassion, pluralism, coexistence, and peace is a far cry from how it is perceived by many in the West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://institute.global/insight/co-existence/religion-conflict-and-geopolitics-2017|title=Religion, Conflict, and Geopolitics in 2017|website=Institute for Global Change|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref></blockquote><blockquote>The raison d\u2019\u00eatre of Islamic civilisations and the shariah for a thousand years was to provide five things: security, worship, preservation of the family, nourishment of the intellect and protection of property. These are called maqasid, or the higher objectives of the shariah. Britain provides these in multitudes for every Muslim today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/britain-and-islam-the-real-special-relationship/|title=Britain and Islam \u2013 the real special relationship|date=26 May 2018|website=The Spectator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>Husain has also urged Muslims in the West to respond to the challenge of Islamic extremism. In an article in the ''Evening Standard'', he stated that:<blockquote>Too often in Britain, in the name of freedom we provide protection for this murderous mindset. This mix of political ideology and puritan theology leads to the global curse of Salafi-Jihadism. We must stop protecting it...Most victims of Salafi-Jihadism are ordinary Muslims. In Britain, teachers, imams, politicians, social workers and families must not protect intolerance, but reject it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/ed-husain-british-muslims-must-reject-intolerance-to-defy-extremists-a3547151.html|title=Ed Husain: British Muslims must reject intolerance to defy extremists|date=24 May 2017|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Middle East Federation ===\nHusain has called for a federal union of Middle Eastern states along the lines of the [[European Union]] in order to defeat religious sectarianism in the region and promote economic and political cooperation.\n\nHe writes:<blockquote>After all, most of its problems \u2013 terrorism, poverty, unemployment, sectarianism, refugee crises, water shortages \u2013 require regional answers. No country can solve its problems on its own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ce55c70c-f6f9-11e3-8ed6-00144feabdc0|title=The EU offers a model for unifying the Middle East|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=2014|website=FT}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nHusain is a noted critic of Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses and role in promoting Islamist extremism worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/opinion/isis-atrocities-started-with-saudi-support-for-salafi-hate.html|title=Saudis must stop exporting extremism|last=Husain|first=Ed|website=NYT}}</ref>\n\nHe has, however, spoken against isolating Saudi Arabia politically, arguing that the rise of Iranian theocracy in the Middle East requires ever closer alliances between the west and its Arab allies. Though critical of Saudi Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman|Mohammed bin Salman]], Husain has written in favour of western, and specifically British, support for his early steps towards reform in order to 'shape the future of a global shift towards peace and co-existence' between the Middle East and the west.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/britain-should-not-turn-its-back-on-mbs-and-the-saudis/|title=Britain should not turn its back on MBS and the Saudis|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=2018|website=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\n=== Jeremy Corbyn ===\nHusain has accused British MP and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of 'pitting Britain's Muslims against its Jews' in his struggle for political power against the Conservatives. Not only has Corbyn launched a calculated attack on the Conservatives in the name of Islam to secure the 'Muslim' vote, Husain argues, his proclamations of friendship with Hamas and Hezbollah 'combined with the hard-Left's hatred for America and capitalism made Islamists and Leftists a coalition against the Conservatives'. \u00a0\n\nHusain has called for the removal of this 'racism of low expectations and collectivism' within the Labour leadership, which he argues views the diversity of British Muslims as a single bloc of votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/06/06/jeremy-corbyn-pitting-britains-muslims-against-jews/|title=Jeremy Corbyn is pitting Britain's Muslims against Jews|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=2018|website=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n=== Bahrain ===\nIn an op-ed for the ''New York Times'' in 2012, Husain analysed the political unrest in Bahrain in the wake of the Arab Spring after a visit to the reforming Crown Prince [[Salman, Crown Prince of Bahrain|Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa]]. Noting the strong influence of the pro-Iran, anti-democracy cleric Ayatollah [[Isa Qassim|Issa Qasim]] on the Shiite opposition party [[Al Wefaq]] (which blocked bills for women's rights and equality that were supported by both the monarchy and Sunni parties), Husain urged the West not to \"not provide diplomatic cover for rioters and clerics in the name of human rights and democracy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/opinion/the-prince-and-the-ayatollah.html|title=The Prince and the Ayatollah|last=Husain|first=Ed|website=NYT}}</ref> \u00a0\n\nHe called Bahrain a 'focal point of what is happening in the Middle East today \u2013 the battle to find a balance between preserving the best values of the Islamic tradition while the region eases its way into the modern world.'\n\n=== Israel and Palestine ===\nHusain supports a [[two-state solution]] to end the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]]. He has condemned the suicide bombing of Israeli civilians as well as the \"killing of Palestinian civilians by the Hamas-led Gazan government\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/27/withgodontheirside|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|title=With God on their side?|first=Ed|last=Husain|date=27 June 2007|access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe is opposed to the international [[boycott of Israel]] by activists, stating in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that:\n{{quote|Many people condemn Israeli settlements and call for an economic boycott of their produce, but I saw that it was Arab builders, plumbers, taxi drivers and other workers who maintained Israeli lifestyles. Separatism in the Holy Land has not worked and it is time to end it.

He has urged western governments to take on a deeper understanding of its extremist worldview, arguing:\n<blockquote>Unless we decimate the theological and ideological appeal of Isis, we will see the rise of an even more radicalised and violent force. Isis offers a caliphate and death. Our message needs to be of life, an Islam of the Muslim majority supported by 1,400 years of history. We must help Arab allies to reform, to create a regional Middle East union that transcends artificial borders, creates economic prosperity and reinstates Arab dignity. Terrorists cannot compete on this stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/624d8d48-603e-11e4-88d1-00144feabdc0|title=Until we understand Isis, we cannot hope to defeat it|last=Husain|first=Ed|date=30 October 2014|website=Financial Times}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== U.S. response to the Arab Spring ===\nOn the [[Arab Spring]], he has said:\n<blockquote>\nThe Arab world is no longer across the oceans. It is also on our streets here. Millions of American citizens are of Arab descent. Millions more are here as workers and students. What happens over there matters here. Can America make these people proud and empower them against Muslim extremists by changing the American story and making us all safer? Yes, it can. It must.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012805611.html \"How Should the U.S. Respond to the Protests in the Middle East?\"], Ed Husain, ''Washington Post''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHusain advocates American soft power and leadership in modelling democracy. Countering the US response to the Egyptian military's raiding of NGO offices in 2012, he said:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe U.S. government should ask its military allies to return to their barracks and cease killing protesters\u2014and that it should tie these demands to U.S. aid. ... The Arab revolutionaries did not look to China or Russia for a model of government. They looked to four-year presidential terms, inspired directly by American democracy. Islamist leaders such as Tunisia's Mohamed Ghannouchi condemn French secularism but highlight American accommodation of religion as a model of a secular state that is less hostile to religion.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203718504577178600154964904 \"Egypt's Revolt and the American Model\"], ''The Wall Street Journal''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Husain argued against U.S. military intervention in Syria, stating:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat happens in Syria does not stay in Syria. ... U.S. military intervention in Syria would likely see traditional state actors backing rival groups (Sunnis and Muslim Brotherhood by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for example, Shia and Alawites by Iran, Druze and Christians by France, a former colonial master, or even indirectly Israel). Worse, there is a real possibility of the emergence of an al-Qaeda-inspired organization inside Syria to fight \"Western imperialism,\" much like al-Qaeda or the \"Sunni insurgency\" in Iraq.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/we-intervene-in-syria-at-our-peril/252335/ \"We Intervene in Syria at Our Peril\"], ''The Atlantic''</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Al-Qaeda ===\nIn a May 2011 op-ed in ''[[The Times]]'', Husain warned against [[al-Qaeda]]'s success as a brand:\n<blockquote>\nWithout doubt, the US was right to remove bin Laden, but it is wrong to think that his death will weaken al-Qaeda. Yes, a colossal psychological blow has been dealt, but al-Qaeda is no longer a mere organisation, but a global brand, an idea, a philosophy that now has its first Saudi martyr from the holy lands of Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/bin-laden-more-dangerous-dead-than-alive/p24891],|title=''The Times'', \"Bin Laden is More Dangerous Dead than Alive\"|website=cfr.org|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Husain criticized the September 2011 extrajudicial killing of American citizen [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], explaining that it is \"counterproductive to defeating terrorism in the long term because it demolishes the very values that America stands for: the rule of law and trial by jury.\" Furthermore, \"An easier, cheaper and more effective way of discrediting al-Awlaki and countering his message would have been to disclose his three arrests for the solicitation of prostitutes ...\"<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/30/opinion/husain-awlaki- killing/index.html], CNN, \"U.S. Shouldn't Have Killed al-Awlaki\"</ref>\n\n=== Syrian Civil War ===\nHusain has warned of the involvement of Al-Qaeda and like minded groups in the Syrian Civil War:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhether Assad stays or goes, jihadism now has a strong foothold in Syria. The Free Syrian Army may wish to dismiss its al-Qaeda allies as irrelevant in order to reassure the West and continue receiving Western support, but the jihadi websites and footage of al-Qaeda fighting in Damascus and Aleppo tell a different story.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/314685/syria-why-al-qaeda-winning-ed-husain] National Review \"Syria: Why al-Qaeda is Winning\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Publications ==\nHusain is the author of two books: ''The Islamist'', which was a finalist for the George Orwell prize for political writing, and ''The House of Islam: A Global History'', published in 2018.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Bangladesh|Biography|Islam}}\n* ''[[The Islamist]]''\n* [[Council on Foreign Relations]]\n*[[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]]\n* [[Islamism]]\n* [[Extremism]]\n* [[List of British Bangladeshis]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=February 2019}}\n* [http://www.cfr.org/experts/civil-society-middle-east-islamist-politics/ed-husain/b15381 Bio page at CFR.org]\n* ''The Islamist'' \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515040826/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141030432,00.html Penguin Books]\n* [http://www.quilliamfoundation.org The Quilliam Foundation website]\n* [http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/11/middle-east-turmoil-american-killed-in-libyan-protests-says-official/ September 2012 CNN Out Front Interview with Ed Husain on Syrian Uprisings (Video)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120707015521/http://www.religionandsociety.org.uk/faith_debates/radicalisation \"What Have We Learned About Radicalisation?\" March 2012 Panel, Religion and Society Research Programme (Video)]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9588000/9588233.stm September 2011 BBC Radio 4: Effects of 9/11 on Attitudes Toward Muslim-Majority Communities]\n* [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/04/cnr.02.html CNN Interview Transcripts]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/worldhaveyoursay/2007/04/kumi_naidoo_and_ed_husian.html BBC World Have Your Say with Ed Husain]\n* [http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_freevideo/~3/113795673/index.html CNN Interview with Ed Husain (Video)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090225043312/http://theislamist.tumblr.com/ 2007 Ed Husain response to FAQs about \"The Islamist\"]\n* [http://lyonspress.com/radical-9780762791361- Lyons Press page for ''Radical'' by Maajid Nawaz]\n\n{{Islamism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Husain, Ed}}\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English Muslims]]\n[[Category:Sunni Sufis]]\n[[Category:English people of Bangladeshi descent]]\n[[Category:British expatriates in the United States]]\n[[Category:Muslim writers]]\n[[Category:English autobiographers]]\n[[Category:Writers from London]]\n[[Category:People from the London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Tower Hamlets College]]\n[[Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London]]\n[[Category:Damascus University alumni]]\n[[Category:Alumni of London Metropolitan University]]\n[[Category:Critics of Islamism]]\n", "name_user": "Bluelily999", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated views", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Husain"}

''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: versions of Wilde during the last 100 years'' 2002</ref> A dandy could be a [[self-made man]] who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from a [[middle-class]] background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nPrevious manifestations of the ''petit-ma\u00eetre'' (French for \"small master\") and the [[Muscadin]] have been noted by John C. Prevost,<ref>''Le Dandysme en France (1817\u20131839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.</ref> but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.\n\n[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later \"metaphysical\" phase of dandyism,<ref>See Prevost 1957.</ref> as one who elevates [[\u00e6sthetics]] to a living religion,<ref>Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], \"The Painter of Modern Life\".</ref> that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: \"Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]\" and \"These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind.\"\n\nThe linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.<ref>Aileen Ribeiro, \"On Englishness in dress\" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.</ref> Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling effect of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of \"the perfect gentleman\" or \"the autonomous aristocrat\". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the \"successfully marketed lives\" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].<ref>Schmid 2002.</ref> [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;<ref>Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading \"Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation\".</ref> similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing (\"[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]\") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American citizen-colonist's means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a \"dandy\" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee \"Yankee Doodle\"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].</ref> A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,<ref>{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a.

The original, full form of 'dandy' may have been ''jack-a-dandy''.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911</ref> It was a [[vogue word]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In that contemporary slang, a \"dandy\" was differentiated from a \"[[fop]]\" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning \"fine\" or \"great\"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.<ref>See, for example, the ''Dandyism'' blog by Christian Chensvold, continually since 2004, but with a published record on the subject since the mid-1990s. http://www.dandyism.net</ref>\n\n== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==\n[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]\nThe model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummell]] (1778\u20131840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was \"based on nothing at all,\" as [[Jules Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.<ref>Barbey d'Aurevilly, \"Du dandisme et de George Brummell,\" (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' 1925:87\u201392).</ref> Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,<ref>\"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century\" (Schmid 2002:83),</ref> he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]]. From the mid-1790s, Beau Brummell was the early incarnation of \"the celebrity\", a man chiefly famous for ''being'' famous.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=Ian |title=Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Man of Style |date=2006 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=9780743270892 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/beaubrummellulti00kell }}</ref>\n\nBy the time [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|taxed hair powder]] in 1795 to help pay for the war against France and to discourage the use of flour (which had recently increased in both rarity and price, owing to bad harvests) in such a frivolous product, Brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig, and had his hair cut in the Roman fashion, \"\u00e0 la Brutus\". Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark \"[[Trousers|pantaloons]],\" which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], aged 61.<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 6018\u20136019). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nMen of more notable accomplishments than Beau Brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose: [[Lord Byron]] occasionally dressed the part, helping reintroduce the frilled, lace-cuffed and lace-collared \"[[poet shirt]]\". In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.\n\nIn 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: <blockquote>A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...<ref>[[Thomas Carlyle]], \"The Dandiacal Body\", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements\u2014\"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on.

His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.<ref>Roman Meinhold, trans.

The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.\n\n[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later \"metaphysical\" phase of dandyism,<ref>See Prevost 1957.</ref> as one who elevates [[\u00e6sthetics]] to a living religion,<ref>Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], \"The Painter of Modern Life\".</ref> that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: \"Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]\" and \"These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind.\"\n\nThe linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.<ref>Aileen Ribeiro, \"On Englishness in dress\" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.</ref> Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling effect of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of \"the perfect gentleman\" or \"the autonomous aristocrat\". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the \"successfully marketed lives\" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].<ref>Schmid 2002.</ref> [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;<ref>Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading \"Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation\".</ref> similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing (\"[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]\") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American citizen-colonist's means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a \"dandy\" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee \"Yankee Doodle\"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].</ref> A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,<ref>{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a.

In that contemporary slang, a \"dandy\" was differentiated from a \"[[fop]]\" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning \"fine\" or \"great\"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.<ref>See, for example, the ''Dandyism'' blog by Christian Chensvold, continually since 2004, but with a published record on the subject since the mid-1990s. http://www.dandyism.net</ref>\n\n== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==\n[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]\nThe model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummell]] (1778\u20131840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].

Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark \"[[Trousers|pantaloons]],\" which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], aged 61.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...<ref>[[Thomas Carlyle]], \"The Dandiacal Body\", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements\u2014\"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on.

His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.<ref>Roman Meinhold, trans.

The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance... The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection.

The notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots.\n\nFemale dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early 19th century when ''dandy'' had a derisive definition of \"fop\" or \"over-the-top fellow\"; the female equivalents were ''dandyess'' or ''dandizette''.<ref name=\"Brooks\"/> Charles Dickens, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=VvFIAAAAcAAJ&dq=charles%20dickens%20dandies%20and%20dandizettes&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q=dandies%20and%20dandizettes&f=false ''All the Year Around'' (1869)] comments, \"The dandies and dandizettes of 1819\u201320 must have been a strange race. \"Dandizette\" was a term applied to the feminine devotees to dress, and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandies.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvFIAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189|title=All the Year Round: A Weekly Journal|date=1869|publisher=Chapman & Hall|language=en}}</ref> In 1819, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HopAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Charms of Dandyism'' in three volumes], was published by Olivia Moreland, Chief of the Female Dandies; most likely one of many pseudonyms used by Thomas Ashe.
