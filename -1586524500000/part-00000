The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] in 1972. In 1973, the [[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]] was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [[Soviet Union]], and the United States.

Their concentrations in polar bear tissues continued to rise for decades after being banned, as these chemicals spread through the food chain. Since then, the trend seems to have abated, with tissue concentrations of PCBs declining between studies performed from 1989 to 1993 and studies performed from 1996 to 2002.

An [[oil spill]] in the Arctic would most likely concentrate in the areas where polar bears and their prey are also concentrated, such as sea ice leads.<ref name=\"iucn3.1\" /> Because polar bears rely partly on their fur for insulation and soiling of the fur by oil reduces its insulative value, oil spills put bears at risk of dying from [[hypothermia]].

The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] in 1972. In 1973, the [[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]] was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [[Soviet Union]], and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030409113042/http://pbsg.npolar.no/ConvAgree/agreement.htm International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears], 15 November 1973, Oslo</ref> The treaty allows hunting \"by local people using traditional methods\". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [[Cold War]]. Biologist [[Ian Stirling (biologist)|Ian Stirling]] commented, \"For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement.

Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September.

Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September.

In their opinion, industrial enterprises should be transferred to the self-government of labor collectives, united in a common federation of manufacturers. Consumption had to be organized through a [[cooperative federation|union of cooperatives]] - local self-governing [[consumer cooperatives|consumer societies]], united in a common federation. Economic life should be organized by the joint arrangements of these two associations, for which it was necessary to create special economic councils, elected from production and consumer organizations. Political and military power should have been concentrated in the hands of political councils elected by the working people on a territorial basis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Ukrainian Left Socialist Revolutionaries (led by [[Yakov Brown]]) believed that along with economic and political councils, councils on ethnic issues should elected by representatives of various ethnic communities of workers - [[Jews]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Greeks]], etc., which, in their opinion, would be especially relevant for multinational Ukraine. Each person received the right to freely \"enroll\" in any community of their choice - ethnicity was considered by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to be a matter of free self-determination of a person, the result of his personal choice, and not a question of blood. The ethnic councils of workers, forming, as it were, the third chamber of power of councils, were to deal with the development of culture, schools, institutions, educational systems in local languages, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]\n* [[Russian Revolution]]/[[Russian Civil War]]\n* [[Left SR Uprising]]\n* [[Tambov Rebellion]]\n* [[Green armies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Russian Revolution 1917}}\n[[Category:1917 establishments in Russia]]\n[[Category:Defunct socialist parties in Russia]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1917]]\n[[Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution]]\n[[Category:Socialist Revolutionary Party]]\n[[Category:Soviet opposition groups]]\n", "name_user": "Grnrchst", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground:DABed link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries"}
