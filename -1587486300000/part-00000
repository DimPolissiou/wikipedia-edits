''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nFairbairn thought about, and wrote about the issue of the child's dependency on his mother in each of his four early papers as he was expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper (which will be described in the next section) on the issue of frustration of legitimate dependency needs as one of the causal factors leading to the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                  \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\n==== Resistance to Treatment Based on the Toxicity of the Internalized Bad Objects ====\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' The prior quote on the effects of a good object as a catalyst to de-repression of the internalized toxic memories did not take resistance into account. Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70)<ref name=\":2\" />. Thus he equates bad internalized objects with devils, who tempt the individual to follow self-destructive paths. Specifically, trying to force love out of an unloving parent, or conversely, demanding that a rejecting parent learns to appreciate and value a disparaged child are two examples of self- destructive attachments.  \n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain '''multiplicity of egos''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily  \"known\" material that the central ego sees and accepts, has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the inexperienced  therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==== A Structural Analysis of the Effects of Treatment ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper also gave a brief description the impact  of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis on  the patient's interior world. In the following quote, Fairbairn speaks of \"territories\", which is his physical metaphor for the size of the internal structures. He sees the effects of psychotherapy as decreasing the two sub-egos because the central ego develops strength due to its  acceptance of the therapist as a good and reliable object, and it can now tolerate some or most of the painful realities of his/her childhood.<blockquote>I conceive it as one of the chief aims of psychoanalytical therapy to introduce some change into its topography by way of territorial adjustment. Thus I conceive it as among the most important functions of psychoanalytical therapy (a) to reduce the split of the original ego by restoring to the central ego a maximum of the territories ceded to the libidinal ego and the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego), and (b) to bring the exciting object and the rejecting object so far as possible together within the sphere and influence of the central ego (Fairbairn, 1952,p.129-130)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn was pessimistic regarding the extent that psychotherapy could modify the patient's unconscious in this (1944 paper), however his later papers were far more optimistic. Fairbairn viewed psychopathology as the splitting off of parts of the central ego that were intolerable to accept  and were dissociated and held in the unconscious. In the process, the central ego loses parts of itself, as well as memories  off the reality of his childhood. In addition, the diminished central ego is easily influenced by the unconscious split off beliefs and assumptions of the sub egos, which  can suddenly repress the central ego and become the conscious executive ego for a period of time. This makes  the individual appear erratic (which indeed they are) and causes others with whom they relate to abandon them as they are so changeable and unreliable. Fairbairn saw treatment as gradually allowing the central ego to grow as it learns of, and accepts the truth of what happened to him/her  as a child. The pain and anger of the antilibidinal ego will now make sense to the central ego given that the patient can now access more memories of the rejecting parents. Secondly, his libidinal ego will lose some of its territory, to use Fairbairns metaphor, as the patient's illusions about his parents are scrutinized. His/her fantasy based illusions are based on he libidinal ego not-knowing just how bad the rejecting object once was. With treatment, the central ego can now accept  the reality of the rejecting parents . Given this knowledge, there is no place for an illusory fantasy about the parents assumed  goodness.    \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nFairbairn thought about, and wrote about the issue of the child's dependency on his mother in each of his four early papers as he was expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper (which will be described in the next section) on the issue of frustration of legitimate dependency needs as one of the causal factors leading to the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                  \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\n==== Resistance to Treatment Based on the Toxicity of the Internalized Bad Objects ====\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' The prior quote on the effects of a good object as a catalyst to de-repression of the internalized toxic memories did not take resistance into account. Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70)<ref name=\":2\" />. Thus he equates bad internalized objects with devils, who tempt the individual to follow self-destructive paths. Specifically, trying to force love out of an unloving parent, or conversely, demanding that a rejecting parent learns to appreciate and value a disparaged child are two examples of self- destructive attachments.  \n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain '''multiplicity of egos''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily  \"known\" material that the central ego sees and accepts, has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the inexperienced  therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==== A Structural Analysis of the Effects of Treatment ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper also gave a brief description the impact  of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis on  the patient's interior world. In the following quote, Fairbairn speaks of \"territories\", which is his physical metaphor for the size of the internal structures. He sees the effects of psychotherapy as decreasing the two sub-egos because the central ego develops strength due to its  acceptance of the therapist as a good and reliable object, and it can now tolerate some or most of the painful realities of his/her childhood.<blockquote>I conceive it as one of the chief aims of psychoanalytical therapy to introduce some change into its topography by way of territorial adjustment. Thus I conceive it as among the most important functions of psychoanalytical therapy (a) to reduce the split of the original ego by restoring to the central ego a maximum of the territories ceded to the libidinal ego and the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego), and (b) to bring the exciting object and the rejecting object so far as possible together within the sphere and influence of the central ego (Fairbairn, 1952,p.129-130)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn was pessimistic regarding the extent that psychotherapy could modify the patient's unconscious in this (1944 paper), however his later papers were far more optimistic. Fairbairn viewed psychopathology as the splitting off of parts of the central ego that were were intolerable to accept  and were dissociated and held in the unconscious. In the process, the central ego loses parts of itself, as well as memories  off the reality of his childhood. In addition, the diminished central ego is easily influenced by the unconscious split off beliefs and assumptions of the sub egos, which  can suddenly repress the central ego and become the conscious executive ego for a period of time. This makes  the individual appear erratic (which indeed they are) and causes others with whom they relate to abandon them as they are so changeable and unreliable. Fairbairn saw treatment as gradually allowing the central ego to grow as it learns of, and accepts the truth of what happened to him/her  as a child. The pain and anger of the antilibidinal ego will now make sense to the central ego given that the patient can now access more memories of the rejecting parents. Secondly, his libidinal ego will lose some of its territory, to use Fairbairns metaphor, as the patient's illusions about his parents are scrutinized. His/her fantasy based illusions are based on he libidinal ego not-knowing just how bad the rejecting object once was. With treatment, the central ego can now accept  the reality of the rejecting parents . Given this knowledge, there is no place for an illusory fantasy about the parents assumed  goodness.    \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\".

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that \"being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box'.\" He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. \"Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording.
