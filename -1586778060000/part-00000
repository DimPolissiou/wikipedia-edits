It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.

An [[aerial refueling]] system increases the range to {{convert|5200|km|mi|abbr=on}} or flight duration up to 10 hours at cruise altitudes.<ref name=knaapo_Su-30MK/><ref name=sukhoi_Su-30MK/>\n\n===Avionics===\nThe aircraft features [[autopilot]] ability at all flight stages including [[Nap-of-the-earth|low-altitude flight]] in [[terrain-following radar]] mode, and individual and group combat employment against air and ground/sea-surface targets.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.

A notable example of when the court has overturned its precedent is, in the case of [[R v Jogee]]; where the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that they and the other courts of England and Wales had misapplied the law for nearly 30 years.\n\nGenerally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over the lower [[court of record|courts of record]], in that they cannot reach out on their initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to overrule judgments of the lower courts.  Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent, and the case is not [[appeal]]ed, the decision will stand.\n\nA lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if it feels that it is unjust; it may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that it should be ''distinguished'' by some material difference between the facts of the cases; some jurisdictions allow for a judge to recommend that an appeal be carried out. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. [[Lord Denning]], first of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], later of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of [[estoppel]] starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130.\n\n== How case law is made ==\n{{rewrite section|date=December 2016}}\nThe different roles of case law in civil and common law traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often interpret the wider legal principles. The necessary analysis (called ''[[ratio decidendi]]''), then constitutes a [[precedent]] binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''[[obiter dicta]]'', which constitute [[persuasive authority]] but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally shorter, referring only to [[statute]]s. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions adhere to a tradition that the reader should be able to deduce the logic from the decision and the statutes.\n\nSome [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems, such as [[Scots law]] in [[Scotland]] and types of civil law jurisdictions in [[Quebec]] and [[Louisiana]], do not precisely fit into the dual common-civil law system classifications. These types of systems may have been heavily influenced by the [[Anglo-America]]n common law tradition; however, their substantive law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition.  Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as mixed systems of law.\n\nLaw [[professor]]s traditionally have played a much smaller role in developing case law in common law than professors in civil law. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are historically brief and not formally amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called [[doctrine]] and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'' in France.  Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as [[Edward Coke|Coke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as [[persuasive authority]]; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in case law. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long-held in civil law jurisdictions.\n\nJudges may refer to various types of [[persuasive authority]] to decide a case. Widely cited non-binding sources include legal [[encyclopedia]]s such as ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]'' and ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'',  or the published work of the [[Law Commission]] or the [[American Law Institute]]. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the [[Highway Code]].\n\nIn federal or multi-jurisdictional law systems there may exist conflicts between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved, and it may be necessary to distinguish how the law is applied in one [[district]], province, division or [[appellate court|appellate department]]. Usually, only an appeal accepted by the [[court of last resort]] will resolve such differences and, for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.\n\nAny court may seek to distinguish the present case from that of a binding precedent, to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal of that judgment to a higher court. An appellate court may also decide on an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case, may distinguish them on the facts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/|title=US Case Law|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref>\n\nWhere there are several members of a court deciding a case, there may be one or more judgments given (or reported). Only the reason for the decision of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in an argument. Apart from the rules of procedure for precedent, the weight given to any reported judgment may depend on the reputation of both the reporter and the judges.\n\n==Nordic nations==\nThe legal systems of the [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes included among the civil law systems, but as a separate branch, and sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In [[Sweden]], for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the Continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] (''H\u00f6gsta domstolen'') and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''H\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen''), have the right to set precedent which is in practice (however not formally) binding on all future application of the law. Courts of appeal, both general courts (''hovr\u00e4tter'') and administrative courts (''kammarr\u00e4tter''), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions may be overturned by higher courts. Much of the ''case law'' is used to prove the existence of a law and not, unlike many common law jurisdictions, the creation of law.  \n\n== See also ==\n* [[Legal opinion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://caselawpedia.wikidot.com/ interactive database of European judgments of national courts in the EU]\n\n{{Law}}\n\n[[Category:Case law| ]]\n\n[[ko:\ud310\ub840]]\n[[ms:Hukum perkara]]\n[[no:Rettspraksis]]\n[[pt:Jurisprud\u00eancia]]\n", "text_old": "'''Case law''' is the collection of past legal decisions written by courts and similar [[tribunal|tribunals]] in the course of deciding cases, in which the law was analyzed using these cases to resolve ambiguities for deciding current cases.

''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' has records on the establishment of ''Gyeongdosi'' (capital area market) in March, 490 during [[Soji of Silla|King Soji]]'s reign, and ''Dongsi'' (East Market) in 509, during [[Jijeung of Silla|King Jijeung]]'s reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size ''Gyeongju Bunaejang'' (Gyeongju village market) was referred to as one of the two leading markets in the [[Yeongnam]] area, along with ''[[Daegu]] Bunaejang''. Transportation developed in the late period of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], as the [[Jungang Line]] and the [[Daegu Line]] and the connecting route between [[Pohang]] and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store.

It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to [[Hwarang]], a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as [[Kim Yu-sin]] were Hwarang who played a central role in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, [[Goryeo]], the system declined and was officially disbanded in the [[Joseon dynasty]]. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.<ref>Doniger, Wendy (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDsk47MeksAC&pg=PA482 Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{ISBN|1-59339-491-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |script-title=ko:\ud654\ub791\ub3c4 \u82b1\u90de\u5f92 |trans-title=Hwarangdo |publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103022341/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |archivedate=2005-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Korea-Gyeongju Hyanggyo-04.jpg|thumb|left|alt=On a sunny day, a Korean traditional wooden building painted with white and dark red stands on a grass field.

''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' has records on the establishment of ''Gyeongdosi'' (capital area market) in March, 490 during [[Soji of Silla|King Soji]]'s reign, and ''Dongsi'' (East Market) in 509, during [[Jijeung of Silla|King Jijeung]]'s reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size ''Gyeongju Bunaejang'' (Gyeongju village market) was referred to as one of the two leading markets in the [[Yeongnam]] area, along with ''[[Daegu]] Bunaejang''. Transportation developed in the late period of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], as the [[Jungang Line]] and the [[Daegu Line]] and the connecting route between [[Pohang]] and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store.

It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to [[Hwarang]], a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as [[Kim Yu-sin]] were Hwarang who played a central role in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, [[Goryeo]], the system declined and was officially disbanded in the [[Joseon dynasty]]. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.<ref>Doniger, Wendy (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDsk47MeksAC&pg=PA482 Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{ISBN|1-59339-491-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |script-title=ko:\ud654\ub791\ub3c4 \u82b1\u90de\u5f92 |trans-title=Hwarangdo |publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103022341/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |archivedate=2005-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Korea-Gyeongju Hyanggyo-04.jpg|thumb|left|alt=On a sunny day, a Korean traditional wooden building painted with white and dark red stands on a grass field.
