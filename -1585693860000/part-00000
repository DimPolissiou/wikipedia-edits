If the brain perceives the threat as credible, it creates the sensation of pain to direct attention to the body part, so the threat can hopefully be mitigated; this process is called [[nociception]].\n\n==History==\n\nNociceptors were discovered by [[Charles Scott Sherrington]] in 1906. In earlier centuries, scientists believed that animals were like mechanical devices that transformed the energy of sensory stimuli into motor responses. Sherrington used many different experiments to demonstrate that different types of stimulation to an [[afferent nerve fiber]]'s [[receptive field]] led to different responses. Some intense stimuli trigger reflex [[Withdrawal reflex|withdrawal]], certain [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic responses]], and [[pain]]. The specific receptors for these intense stimuli were called nociceptors.<ref>Sherrington C. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 1906.</ref>\n\n==Location==\nIn mammals, nociceptors are found in any area of the body that can sense noxious stimuli.   External nociceptors are found in [[Biological tissue|tissue]] such as the [[skin]] ([[cutaneous nociceptor]]s), the [[cornea]]s, and the [[mucosa]]. Internal nociceptors are found in a variety of organs, such as the [[muscle]]s, the [[joint]]s, the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], and the digestive tract. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in either the [[dorsal root ganglia]] or the [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] ganglia.<ref name = Jessell>{{cite book |author1=Jessell, Thomas M. |author2=Kandel, Eric R. |author3=Schwartz, James H. |title=Principles of neural science |publisher=Appleton & Lange |location=Norwalk, CT |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofneur00kan/page/472 472\u201379] |isbn=978-0-8385-8034-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofneur00kan/page/472 }}</ref> The trigeminal ganglia are specialized nerves for the face, whereas the dorsal root ganglia are associated with the rest of the body. The axons extend into the peripheral nervous system and terminate in branches to form receptive fields.\n\n==Development==\nNociceptors develop from [[Neural crest|neural-crest]] stem cells. The neural crest is responsible for a large part of early development in vertebrates.  It is specifically responsible for development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neural-crest stem cells split from the neural tube as it closes, and nociceptors grow from the dorsal part of this neural-crest tissue. They form late during neurogenesis. Earlier forming cells from this region can become non-pain sensing receptors, either [[proprioceptors]] or low-threshold [[mechanoreceptors]]. All neurons derived from the neural crest, including embryonic nociceptors, express the TrkA, which is a receptor to nerve-growth factor (NGF). However, transcription factors that determine the type of nociceptor remain unclear.<ref name = Woolf>{{cite journal |vauthors=Woolf CJ, Ma Q |title=Nociceptors\u2014noxious stimulus detectors |journal=Neuron |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=353\u201364 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17678850 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.016 |url=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing sensory neurogenesis, differentiation occurs, and two types of nociceptors are formed. They are classified as either peptidergic or nonpeptidergic nociceptors, each of which express a distinct repertoire of ion channels and receptors.  Their specializations allow the receptors to innervate different central and peripheral targets. This differentiation occurs in both perinatal and postnatal periods. The nonpeptidergic nociceptors switch off the TrkA and begin expressing Ret, which is a transmembrane signaling component that allows the expression of glial-cell-derived growth factor (GDNF). This transition is assisted by Runx1 which is vital in the development of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. On the contrary, the peptidergic nociceptors continue to use TrkA, and they express a completely different type of growth factor.  There currently is a lot of research about the differences between nociceptors.<ref name = Woolf/>\n\n==Types and functions==\nThe peripheral terminal of the mature nociceptor is where the [[noxious stimuli]] are detected and transduced into electrical energy.<ref>Fein, A Nociceptors: the cells that sense pain  http://cell.uchc.edu/pdf/fein/nociceptors_fein_2012.pdf</ref> When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an [[action potential]] is induced and driven towards the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities they respond to. Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.\n\nNociceptors have two different types of axons. The first are the [[A delta fiber|A\u03b4 fiber]] axons. They are myelinated and can allow an action potential to travel at a rate of about 20 meters/second towards the CNS. The other type is the more slowly conducting [[C fiber]] axons. These only conduct at speeds of around 2 meters/second.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Williams, S. J. |author2=Purves, Dale |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=978-0-87893-742-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> This is due to the light or non-myelination of the axon. As a result, pain comes in two phases. The first phase is mediated by the fast-conducting A\u03b4 fibers and the second part due to (Polymodal) C fibers. The pain associated with the A\u03b4 fibers can be associated to an initial extremely sharp pain. The second phase is a more prolonged and slightly less intense feeling of pain as a result of the acute damage. If there is massive or prolonged input to a C fiber, there is a progressive build up in the spinal cord dorsal horn; this phenomenon is similar to [[tetanus]] in muscles but is called [[Pain wind-up|wind-up]]. If wind-up occurs there is a probability of increased sensitivity to pain.<ref name = Fields>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields HL, Rowbotham M, Baron R |title=Postherpetic neuralgia: irritable nociceptors and deafferentation |journal=Neurobiol. Dis. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=209\u201327 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9848092 |doi=10.1006/nbdi.1998.0204 |url=}}</ref>\n===Thermal===\nThermal nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers that are responsible for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was [[TRPV1]], and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other temperature in the warm\u2013hot range is mediated by more than one [[Transient receptor potential channel|TRP channel]]. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm\u2013hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by [[TRPM8]] channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.\n\n===Mechanical===\nMechanical nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation. They also respond to incisions that break the skin surface. The reaction to the stimulus is processed as pain by the cortex, just like chemical and thermal responses. These mechanical nociceptors frequently have mpolymodal characteristics. So it is possible that some of the transducers for thermal stimuli are the same for mechanical stimuli. The same is true for chemical stimuli, since TRPA1 appears to detect both mechanical and chemical changes.\n\n===Chemical===\nChemical nociceptors have TRP channels that respond to a wide variety of spices. The one that sees the most response and is very widely tested is [[capsaicin]]. Other chemical stimulants are environmental irritants like [[acrolein]], a [[World War I]] [[chemical weapon]] and a component of cigarette smoke. Apart from these external stimulants, chemical nociceptors have the capacity to detect endogenous ligands, and certain fatty acid amines that arise from changes in internal tissues. Like in thermal nociceptors, TRPV1 can detect chemicals like capsaicin and spider toxins.<ref name = Woolf/>\n\n===Sleeping/silent===\nAlthough each nociceptor can have a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred. These are typically referred to as silent or sleeping nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue.<ref name = Jessell/>\n\n===Polymodal===\nMany neurons perform only a single function; therefore, neurons that perform these functions in combination are given the classification \"polymodal.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Fein|first=Alan|title=Nociceptors: the cells that sense pain|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hmOsHYsGdh0C&lpg=SA1-PA6&dq=nociceptor&pg=SA1-PA5#v=onepage&q=nociceptor&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Pathway==\n{{anchor|Pathway}}\n[[Afferent nerve|Afferent]] nociceptive fibers (those that send information ''to'', rather than ''from'' the brain) travel back to the [[spinal cord]] where they form synapses in its [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]]. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Different fiber types form [[chemical synapse|synapses]] in different layers, and use either [[glutamate]] or [[substance P]] as the neurotransmitter. A\u03b4 fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, A\u03b2 fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V.<ref name = Jessell/>  After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. The second order neurons then send their information via two pathways to the [[thalamus]]: the [[Dorsal column-medial lemniscus system|dorsal column medial-lemniscal system]] and the [[anterolateral system]]. The first is reserved more for regular non-painful sensation, while the lateral is reserved for pain sensation. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the [[cerebral cortex]] in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. As there is an ascending pathway to the brain that initiates the conscious realization of pain, there also is a descending pathway which modulates pain sensation. The brain can request the release of specific [[hormones]] or chemicals that can have analgesic effects which can reduce or inhibit pain sensation. The area of the brain that stimulates the release of these hormones is the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.macalester.edu/psychology/whathap/UBNRP/Audition/site/pain%20pathway.html | title = Pain Pathway | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThis effect of descending inhibition can be shown by electrically stimulating the [[periaqueductal grey]] area of the midbrain. The periaqueductal grey in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the [[nucleus raphes magnus]] which also receives similar afferents from the [[nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis]] (NPG). In turn the [[nucleus raphe magnus]] projects to the [[substantia gelatinosa]] region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The periaqueductal grey also contains [[opioid receptors]] which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as [[morphine]] and [[diacetylmorphine]] exhibit an analgesic effect.\n\n==Sensitivity==\nNociceptor neuron sensitivity is modulated by a large variety of mediators in the extracellular space.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hucho T, Levine JD |title=Signaling pathways in sensitization: toward a nociceptor cell biology |journal=Neuron |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=365\u201376 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17678851 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.008 |url=}}</ref> Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This is commonly known as [[hyperalgesia]]. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in [[allodynia]]: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.<ref name = Fields/>\n\n==Other animals==\n\nNociception has been documented in non-mammalian animals, including fish<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sneddon L.

If there is massive or prolonged input to a C fiber, there is a progressive build up in the spinal cord dorsal horn; this phenomenon is similar to [[tetanus]] in muscles but is called [[Pain wind-up|wind-up]]. If wind-up occurs there is a probability of increased sensitivity to pain.<ref name = Fields>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields HL, Rowbotham M, Baron R |title=Postherpetic neuralgia: irritable nociceptors and deafferentation |journal=Neurobiol. Dis. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=209\u201327 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9848092 |doi=10.1006/nbdi.1998.0204 |url=}}</ref>\n===Thermal===\nThermal nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers that are responsible for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was [[TRPV1]], and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other temperature in the warm\u2013hot range is mediated by more than one [[Transient receptor potential channel|TRP channel]]. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm\u2013hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by [[TRPM8]] channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.\n\n===Mechanical===\nMechanical nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation. They also respond to incisions that break the skin surface. The reaction to the stimulus is processed as pain by the cortex, just like chemical and thermal responses. These mechanical nociceptors frequently have polymodal characteristics. So it is possible that some of the transducers for thermal stimuli are the same for mechanical stimuli. The same is true for chemical stimuli, since TRPA1 appears to detect both mechanical and chemical changes.\n\n===Chemical===\nChemical nociceptors have TRP channels that respond to a wide variety of spices. The one that sees the most response and is very widely tested is [[capsaicin]]. Other chemical stimulants are environmental irritants like [[acrolein]], a [[World War I]] [[chemical weapon]] and a component of cigarette smoke. Apart from these external stimulants, chemical nociceptors have the capacity to detect endogenous ligands, and certain fatty acid amines that arise from changes in internal tissues. Like in thermal nociceptors, TRPV1 can detect chemicals like capsaicin and spider toxins.<ref name = Woolf/>\n\n===Sleeping/silent===\nAlthough each nociceptor can have a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred. These are typically referred to as silent or sleeping nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue.<ref name = Jessell/>\n\n===Polymodal===\nMany neurons perform only a single function; therefore, neurons that perform these functions in combination are given the classification \"polymodal.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Fein|first=Alan|title=Nociceptors: the cells that sense pain|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hmOsHYsGdh0C&lpg=SA1-PA6&dq=nociceptor&pg=SA1-PA5#v=onepage&q=nociceptor&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Pathway==\n{{anchor|Pathway}}\n[[Afferent nerve|Afferent]] nociceptive fibers (those that send information ''to'', rather than ''from'' the brain) travel back to the [[spinal cord]] where they form synapses in its [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]]. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Different fiber types form [[chemical synapse|synapses]] in different layers, and use either [[glutamate]] or [[substance P]] as the neurotransmitter. A\u03b4 fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, A\u03b2 fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V.<ref name = Jessell/>  After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. The second order neurons then send their information via two pathways to the [[thalamus]]: the [[Dorsal column-medial lemniscus system|dorsal column medial-lemniscal system]] and the [[anterolateral system]]. The first is reserved more for regular non-painful sensation, while the lateral is reserved for pain sensation. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the [[cerebral cortex]] in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. As there is an ascending pathway to the brain that initiates the conscious realization of pain, there also is a descending pathway which modulates pain sensation. The brain can request the release of specific [[hormones]] or chemicals that can have analgesic effects which can reduce or inhibit pain sensation. The area of the brain that stimulates the release of these hormones is the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.macalester.edu/psychology/whathap/UBNRP/Audition/site/pain%20pathway.html | title = Pain Pathway | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThis effect of descending inhibition can be shown by electrically stimulating the [[periaqueductal grey]] area of the midbrain. The periaqueductal grey in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the [[nucleus raphes magnus]] which also receives similar afferents from the [[nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis]] (NPG). In turn the [[nucleus raphe magnus]] projects to the [[substantia gelatinosa]] region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The periaqueductal grey also contains [[opioid receptors]] which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as [[morphine]] and [[diacetylmorphine]] exhibit an analgesic effect.\n\n==Sensitivity==\nNociceptor neuron sensitivity is modulated by a large variety of mediators in the extracellular space.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hucho T, Levine JD |title=Signaling pathways in sensitization: toward a nociceptor cell biology |journal=Neuron |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=365\u201376 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17678851 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.008 |url=}}</ref> Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This is commonly known as [[hyperalgesia]]. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in [[allodynia]]: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.<ref name = Fields/>\n\n==Other animals==\n\nNociception has been documented in non-mammalian animals, including fish<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sneddon L.

[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe '''Lord's Prayer''', also called the '''Our Father''' ({{lang-la|Pater Noster}}), is a central [[Christian prayer]] which, according to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] taught as the way to pray:\n:''Pray then in this way ...'' ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 6:9}} [[NRSV]])\n:''When you pray, say ...'' ({{Bibleref2|Luke 11:2||NRSV}} NRSV)\nTwo versions of this prayer are recorded in the [[gospels]]: a longer form within the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], and a shorter form in the [[Gospel of Luke]] when \"one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as [[John the Baptist|John]] taught his disciples.{{' \"}} ({{Bibleref2|Luke 11:1||NRSV}} NRSV). [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Harold H. Buls|Harold Buls]] suggested that both were original, the Matthean version spoken by Jesus early in his ministry in [[Galilee]], and the Lucan version one year later, \"very likely in [[Judea]]\".<ref>Buls, H. H., [http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/bul/east-05a.html The Sermon Notes of Harold Buls: Easter V], accessed 15 June 2018</ref>\n\nThe first three of the seven petitions in Matthew address God; the other four are related to human needs and concerns. The Matthew account alone includes the \"Your will be done\" and the \"Rescue us from the evil one\" (or \"Deliver us from evil\") petitions. Both original [[Greek language|Greek]] texts contain the adjective ''[[epiousios]]'', which does not appear in any other classical or [[Koine Greek]] literature; while controversial, \"daily\" has been the most common English-language translation of this word. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] usually conclude the prayer with a [[doxology]], a later [[addendum]] appearing in some [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] of Matthew.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{bibleref2|Matthew|6:9-13|NRSV}} ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]) !!{{bibleref2|Luke|11:2-4|NRSV}} (NRSV)\n|-\n| Our Father in heaven, || Father, [Other ancient authorities read ''Our father in heaven''] \n|-\n| hallowed be your name. || hallowed be your name.\n|-\n| Your kingdom come. || Your kingdom come. \n|-\n|\n|[A few ancient authorities read ''Your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us.'']\n|-\n| Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. ||[Other ancient authorities add ''Your will be done, on earth as in heaven'']\n|-\n| Give us this day our [[epiousios|daily]] bread.

Although theological differences and various modes of worship divide Christians, according to [[Fuller Seminary]] professor Clayton Schmit, \"there is a sense of solidarity in knowing that Christians around the globe are praying together ... and these words always unite us.\"<ref>Kang, K. Connie. \"Across the globe, Christians are united by Lord's Prayer.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', in ''Houston Chronicle'', p. A13, April 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn [[biblical criticism]], the prayer's absence in the [[Gospel of Mark]] together with its occurrence in Matthew and Luke has caused scholars who accept the [[two-source hypothesis]] (against other [[Synoptic problem|document hypotheses]]) to conclude that it is probably a ''[[Logia|logion]]'' original to [[Q source|Q]].<ref>Farmer, William R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkO4qzxHrsEC&pg=PA49 ''The Gospel of Jesus: The Pastoral Relevance of the Synoptic Problem''], [[Westminster John Knox|Westminster John Knox Press]] (1994), p. 49, {{ISBN|978-0-664-25514-5}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n=== Original Greek text and Syriac and Latin translations ===\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-3}}\n'''Standard edition of Greek text'''<ref>The [http://www.nestle-aland.com/en/read-na28-online/text/bibeltext/lesen/stelle/50/60001/69999/ text] given here is that of the latest edition of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]]'' of the United Bible Societies and in the Nestle-Aland ''Novum Testamentum Graece''.

Of those in current liturgical use, the three best-known are:\n* The translation in the 1662 Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP) of the [[Church of England]]\n* The slightly modernized form used in the 1928 version of the Prayer Book of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (sometimes with the [[doxology]]), corresponding to the version in use among English-speaking Catholics from an earlier date (always without the doxology)\n* The 1988 translation of the [[ecumenical]] [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC)\nThe square brackets in three of the texts below indicate the [[doxology]] often added at the end of the prayer by Protestants and, in a slightly different form, by the [[Byzantine Rite]] (\"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.

The Anglican Book of Common Prayer adds it in some services but not in all. Older English translations of the Bible, based on late Byzantine Greek manuscripts, included it, but it is excluded in critical editions of the New Testament, such as that of the [[Bible society#Current Bible Societies|United Bible Societies]]. It is absent in the oldest manuscripts and is not considered to be part of the original text of [[Matthew 6:9]]\u2013[[Matthew 6:13|13]]. The Catholic Church has never attached it to the Lord's Prayer, but has included it in the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as revised in 1969, not as part of the Our Father but separated from it by a prayer called the [[Embolism (liturgy)|embolism]] spoken or sung by the priest (in the official [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]] English translation: \"Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\") that elaborates on the final petition, \"Deliver us from evil.\" For more information on this doxology, see [[#Doxology|Doxology]], below. When Reformers set out to translate the King James Bible, they assumed that a Greek manuscript they possessed was ancient and therefore adopted the phrase \"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever\" into the Lord's Prayer. Later scholarship demonstrated that the manuscript was actually a late addition based on Eastern liturgical tradition.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n:'''1662 Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer|BCP]]'''''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/communion/index.html|title=The Communion.|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n:Our Father, which art in heaven,\n:Hallowed be thy Name;\n:Thy kingdom come;\n:Thy will be done\n:in earth, as it is in heaven:\n:Give us this day our [[epiousios|daily]] bread;\n:And forgive us our trespasses,\n:as we forgive them that trespass against us;\n:And lead us not into temptation,\n:But deliver us from evil:\n:''When before the Collect the priest alone recites the prayer, the people here respond'': Amen.\n:''When after all have communicated the people repeat each petition after the priest, the prayer ends'':\n:For thine is the kingdom,\n:the power, and the glory,\n:For ever and ever.\n:Amen.\n\n{{col-3}}\n:'''Traditional Catholic version''' (without doxology);<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c5EEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA319&dq=%22our+father+who+art%22+catholic&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw6dCFpf_iAhVGZcAKHTb8BJMQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&q=%22our%20father%20who%20art%22%20catholic&f=false ''A full catechism of the Catholic religion, preceded by a short history of religion from the creation of the world'' (Burns and Oates 1863, pp. 319\u2212322]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2.htm#SECTION%20TWO%20THE%20LORDS%20PRAYER%20OUR%20FATHER!\u00bb Catechism of the Catholic Church]</ref> 1928 Book of Common Prayer of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|United States Episcopal Church]] (sometimes without, sometimes with doxology)<ref>[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/HC.htm The Order for the Administration of the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion].

The latter choice may be due to {{bibleref2|Luke|11:4}}, which uses the word ''sins'', while the former may be due to [[Matthew 6:14]] (immediately after the text of the prayer), where Jesus speaks of ''trespasses''. As early as the third century, [[Origen of Alexandria]] used the word ''trespasses'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}}) in the prayer. Although the Latin form that was traditionally used in Western Europe has ''debita'' (''debts''), most English-speaking Christians (except Scottish Presbyterians and some others of the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] tradition) use ''trespasses''. The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the Established [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] as well as the [[Congregational]] denomination follow the version found in [[Matthew 6]] in the Authorized Version (known also as the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]), which in the prayer uses the words \"debts\" and \"debtors\".\n\nAll these versions are based on the text in Matthew, rather than Luke, of the prayer given by Jesus:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''{{bibleref2|Matthew|6:9\u201313|'''ESV'''}}''' ([[English Standard Version|ESV]])\n\n:\"Pray then like this: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

Accessed 11 Feb 2013</ref> The \"debts\" form appears in the first English translation of the Bible, by [[John Wycliffe]] in 1395 (Wycliffe spelling \"dettis\"). The \"trespasses\" version appears in the 1526 translation by [[William Tyndale]] (Tyndale spelling \"treaspases\"). In 1549 the first [[Book of Common Prayer]] in English used a version of the prayer with \"trespasses\". This became the \"official\" version used in Anglican congregations. On the other hand, the 1611 [[King James Version]], the version specifically [[Authorized Version|authorized]] for the [[Church of England]], has \"forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors\".\n\nAfter the request for bread, Matthew and Luke diverge slightly. Matthew continues with a request for [[debt]]s to be forgiven in the same manner as people have forgiven those who have debts against them. Luke, on the other hand, makes a similar request about [[sin]]s being forgiven in the manner of debts being forgiven between people. The word \"debts\" ({{lang |grc|\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}}) does not necessarily mean financial obligations, as shown by the use of the verbal form of the same word ({{lang|grc|\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5}}) in passages such as {{bibleref2|Romans|13:8}}. The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''\u1e25\u00f4b\u00e2'' can mean \"debt\" or \"sin\".<ref>Nathan Eubank 2013, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fB7YUtXPARUC&pg=PA2 Wages of Cross-Bearing and Debt of Sin]'' (Walter de Gruyter {{ISBN |978-31-1030407-7}}), p. 2</ref><ref>John S.

The generally accepted interpretation is thus that the request is for forgiveness of sin, not of supposed loans granted by God.<ref>''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', Kittel & Friedrich eds., abridged in one volume by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, Mich; 1985), pp. 746\u201350, gives use of \u1f78\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03c9 ''opheilo'' (to owe, be under obligation), \u1f78\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae ''opheile'' (debt, obligation) and two other word forms used in the New Testament and outside the New Testament, including use in Judaism.</ref> Asking for forgiveness from God was a staple of Jewish prayers.{{Citation needed |date=March 2009}} It was also considered proper for individuals to be forgiving of others, so the sentiment expressed in the prayer would have been a common one of the time.{{Citation needed|date= March 2009}}\n\n[[Anthony C. Deane]], Canon of [[Worcester Cathedral]], suggested that the choice of the word \"\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\" (debts), rather than \"\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\" (sins), indicates a reference to failures to use opportunities of doing good. He linked this with the [[The Sheep and the Goats|parable of the sheep and the goats]] (also in Matthew's Gospel), in which the grounds for condemnation are not wrongdoing in the ordinary sense, but failure to do right, missing opportunities for showing [[Charity (virtue)|love]] to others.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|25:31\u201346}}<ref>{{Citation |last= Deane |first=Anthony C. |authorlink= Anthony C.

Divergence between Matthew's \"debts\" and Luke's \"sins\" is relatively trivial compared to the impact of the second half of this statement. The verses immediately following the Lord's Prayer,{{Bibleref2c |Matt.|6:14\u201315}} show Jesus teaching that the forgiveness of our sin/debt (by God) is linked with how we forgive others, as in the [[Parable of the Unforgiving Servant]] {{Bibleref2c |Matt.|18:23\u201335}}, which Matthew gives later. [[R. T. France]] comments:\n<blockquote>\nThe point is not so much that forgiving is a prior condition of being forgiven, but that forgiving cannot be a one-way process. Like all God's gifts it brings responsibility; it must be passed on. To ask for forgiveness on any other basis is hypocrisy. There can be question, of course, of our forgiving being in proportion to what we are forgiven, as 18:23\u201335 makes clear.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttTgacXnLV8C&pg=PA137&dq=France+Matthew+%22prior+condition%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi--Zav17HkAhWjThUIHUCXB3cQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&q=France%20Matthew%20%22prior%20condition%22&f=false R.

The range of meanings of the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\" (peirasmos) is illustrated in New Testament Greek lexicons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3986 |title= Entry for Strong's #3986: ''\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2'' |website= Study Light}}</ref> In different contexts it can mean temptation, testing, trial, experiment. Although the traditional English translation uses the word \"[[temptation]]\" and [[Carl Jung]] saw God as actually leading people astray,<ref>Jung, Carl, \"Answer to Job\"</ref> Christians generally interpret the petition as not contradicting {{bibleref2 |James|1:13\u201314|ESV}}: \"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God', for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.\" Some see the petition as an eschatological appeal against unfavourable [[Last Judgment]], a theory supported by the use of the word \"peirasmos\" in this sense in {{Bibleref2 |Revelation|3:10}}. Others see it as a plea against hard ''tests'' described elsewhere in scripture, such as those of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Psalm|26:2}} and {{Bibleref2|Psalm|139:23}} are respectful challenges for a test to prove the writer's innocence and integrity.</ref> It is also read as: \"Do not let us be led (by ourselves, by others, by Satan) into temptations\". Since it follows shortly after a plea for daily bread (i.e., material sustenance), it is also seen as referring to not being caught up in the material pleasures given. A similar phrase appears in {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:41}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|22:40}} in connection with the prayer of Jesus in Gethsemane.{{sfn |Clontz|Clontz|2008|pp = 451\u201352}}\n\n[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in a translation of the Holy Bible which was not completed before his death, used: \"And suffer us not to be led into temptation\".<ref>JST Matthew 6:14</ref>\n\nIn a conversation on the Italian TV channel ''[[TV2000]]'' on 6 December 2017, [[Pope Francis]] commented that the then Italian wording of this petition (similar to the traditional English) was a poor translation.

He was referring to the 2017 change to a new [[French language|French]] version, ''Et ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation'' (\"Do not let us enter into temptation\"), but spoke of it in terms of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation, ''no nos dejes caer en la tentaci\u00f3n'' (\"do not let us fall in/into temptation\"), that he was accustomed to recite in [[Catholic Church in Argentina|Argentina]] before his election as Pope.

Later parts of Matthew refer to the devil when discussing similar issues. However, the devil is never referred to as ''the evil one'' in any known Aramaic sources. While [[John Calvin]] accepted the vagueness of the term's meaning, he considered that there is little real difference between the two interpretations, and that therefore the question is of no real consequence.

The Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] sometimes gives the Lord's Prayer with the doxology, sometimes without.<ref>For instance, in [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/principal-services/word/mornevebcp/morningbcp.aspx Morning Prayer] the doxology is included in the Lord's Prayer in the Introduction, but not in the Prayers after the Apostles' Creed.</ref> Most [[Protestant]]s append it to the Lord's Prayer.\n\n==Use as a language comparison tool==\n[[File:Lithuanian language in European language map 1741.jpg|thumb|220 px|Detail of the ''Europa Polyglotta'' published with ''[[Synopsis Universae Philologiae]]'' in 1741; the map gives the first phrase of the Lord's Prayer in 33 different [[languages of Europe]].]]\n\nIn the course of [[Christianization]], one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the Lord's Prayer, long before the full Bible would be [[Bible translations|translated into the respective languages]].\nSince the 16th century, collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a [[parallel text|quick comparison of languages]].\n\nThe first such collection, with 22 versions, was ''Mithridates, de differentiis linguarum'' by [[Conrad Gessner]] (1555; the title refers to [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] who according to [[Pliny the Elder]] was an [[Hyperpolyglot|exceptional polyglot]]).\n\nGessner's idea of collecting translations of the prayer was taken up by authors of the 17th century, including [[Hieronymus Megiserus]] (1603) and Georg Pistorius (1621).\nThomas L\u00fcdeken in 1680 published an enlarged collection of 83 versions of the prayer,<ref name=\"L\u00fcdeken\">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8NlYAAAAcAAJ&source=bl&ots=FcfMqrsJOR&sig=XTbCTk5R7c6e8alJPIt5rxNUQe4&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8pvrytbTfAhVLzoUKHVkMBFgQ6AEwBXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage Orationis dominicae versiones praeter authenticam fere centum...]'', [[Thomas L\u00fcdeken]], Officina Rungiana, 1680.</ref> of which three were in fictional [[philosophical language]]s.\nL\u00fcdeken quotes as a ''Barnum Hagius'' as his source for the exotic scripts used, while their true (anonymous) author was Andreas M\u00fcller.\nIn 1700, L\u00fcdeken's collection was re-edited by B. Mottus as ''Oratio dominica plus centum linguis versionibus aut characteribus reddita et expressa''.\nThis edition was comparatively inferior, but a second, revised edition was published in 1715 by John Chamberlain.\nThis 1715 edition was used by Gottfried Hensel in his ''[[Synopsis Universae Philologiae]]'' (1741) to compile \"geographico-polyglot maps\" where the beginning of the prayer was shown in the geographical area where the respective languages were spoken.\n[[Johann Ulrich Kraus]] also published a collection with more than 100 entries.<ref>Augustin Backer, Alois Backer, ''Biblioth\u00e8que des \u00e9crivains de la compagnie de J\u00e9sus ou notices bibliographiques'', vol. 5, 1839, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hElDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA304 304f.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lords Prayer in Chinese.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lord's Prayer in [[Classical Chinese]]]]These collections continued to be improved and expanded well into the 19th century; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] and [[Johann Severin Vater]] in 1806\u20131817 published the prayer in \"well-nigh five hundred languages and dialects\".<ref>''Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde mit dem Vater Unser als Sprachprobe in bey nahe f\u00fcnf hundert Sprachen und Mundarten'', 1806\u20131817, Berlin, Vossische Buchlandlung, 4 volumes.

For you are our Father ...\") and {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|36:23}} (\"I will vindicate the holiness of my great name ...\") and {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|38:23}} (\"I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations ...\"), the second part in {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:21}} (\"Saviours shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom shall be the L<small>ORD</small>'s\") and {{Bibleref2|1Sam|3:18||1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;3:18}} (\"... It is the L<small>ORD</small>. Let him do what seems good to him.\"), the third part in {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|30:8}} (\"... feed me with my apportioned bread...\"), the fourth part in {{bibleverse||Sirach|28:2}} (\"Forgive your neighbour the wrong he has done, and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.\"). \"Deliver us from evil\" can be compared with {{Bibleref2|Psalm|119:133}} (\"... let no iniquity get dominion over me.\"). Chumaceiro says that, because the idea of God leading a human into temptation contradicts the righteousness and love of God, \"Lead us not into temptation\" has no counterpart in the Jewish Bible/Christian Old Testament.\n\nThe word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\", which is translated as \"temptation\", could also be translated as \"test\" or \"trial\", making evident the attitude of someone's heart. Well-known examples in the Old Testament are God's test of Abraham ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|22:1}}); his \"moving\" (the Hebrew word means basically \"to prick, as by weeds, thorns\") David to do (numbering Israel) what David later acknowledged as sin ({{Bibleref2|2Sam|24:1\u201310||2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;24:1\u201310}}; see also {{Bibleref2|1Chr|21:1-7||1&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;21:1\u20137}}); and the testing of Job in the ''[[Book of Job]]''.\n\n== Musical settings ==\nIn modern times, various composers have incorporated ''The Lord's Prayer'' into a musical setting for utilization during [[liturgical]] services for a variety of religious traditions as well as [[interfaith]] ceremonies.

It does not add the Byzantine doxology: this is never joined immediately to the Lord's Prayer in the Latin liturgy or the Latin Bible, but it appears, in the form ''quia tuum est regnum, et potestas, et gloria, in saecula'', in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Roman Rite]], as revised in 1969, separated from the Lord's Prayer by the prayer, ''Libera nos, quaesumus...'' (the [[Embolism (liturgy)|embolism]]), which elaborates on the final petition, ''libera nos a malo'' (deliver us from evil).

or Latin, beginning around AD 650 with the [[Northumbrian (Anglo-Saxon)|Northumbrian]] translation. Of those in current liturgical use, the three best-known are:\n* The translation in the 1662 Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP) of the [[Church of England]]\n* The slightly modernized form used in the 1928 version of the Prayer Book of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (sometimes with the [[doxology]]), corresponding to the version in use among English-speaking Catholics from an earlier date (always without the doxology)\n* The 1988 translation of the [[ecumenical]] [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC)\nThe square brackets in three of the texts below indicate the [[doxology]] often added at the end of the prayer by Protestants and, in a slightly different form, by the [[Byzantine Rite]] (\"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.

The Anglican Book of Common Prayer adds it in some services but not in all. Older English translations of the Bible, based on late Byzantine Greek manuscripts, included it, but it is excluded in critical editions of the New Testament, such as that of the [[Bible society#Current Bible Societies|United Bible Societies]]. It is absent in the oldest manuscripts and is not considered to be part of the original text of [[Matthew 6:9]]\u2013[[Matthew 6:13|13]]. The Catholic Church has never attached it to the Lord's Prayer, but has included it in the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as revised in 1969, not as part of the Our Father but separated from it by a prayer called the [[Embolism (liturgy)|embolism]] spoken or sung by the priest (in the official [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]] English translation: \"Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\") that elaborates on the final petition, \"Deliver us from evil.\" For more information on this doxology, see [[#Doxology|Doxology]], below. When Reformers set out to translate the King James Bible, they assumed that a Greek manuscript they possessed was ancient and therefore adopted the phrase \"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever\" into the Lord's Prayer. Later scholarship demonstrated that the manuscript was actually a late addition based on Eastern liturgical tradition.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n:'''1662 Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer|BCP]]'''''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/communion/index.html|title=The Communion.|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n:Our Father, which art in heaven,\n:Hallowed be thy Name;\n:Thy kingdom come;\n:Thy will be done\n:in earth, as it is in heaven:\n:Give us this day our [[epiousios|daily]] bread;\n:And forgive us our trespasses,\n:as we forgive them that trespass against us;\n:And lead us not into temptation,\n:But deliver us from evil:\n:''When before the Collect the priest alone recites the prayer, the people here respond'': Amen.\n:''When after all have communicated the people repeat each petition after the priest, the prayer ends'':\n:For thine is the kingdom,\n:the power, and the glory,\n:For ever and ever.\n:Amen.\n\n{{col-3}}\n:'''Traditional Catholic version''' (without doxology);<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c5EEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA319&dq=%22our+father+who+art%22+catholic&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw6dCFpf_iAhVGZcAKHTb8BJMQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&q=%22our%20father%20who%20art%22%20catholic&f=false ''A full catechism of the Catholic religion, preceded by a short history of religion from the creation of the world'' (Burns and Oates 1863, pp. 319\u2212322]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2.htm#SECTION%20TWO%20THE%20LORDS%20PRAYER%20OUR%20FATHER!\u00bb Catechism of the Catholic Church]</ref> 1928 Book of Common Prayer of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|United States Episcopal Church]] (sometimes without, sometimes with doxology)<ref>[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/HC.htm The Order for the Administration of the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion].

The latter choice may be due to {{bibleref2|Luke|11:4}}, which uses the word ''sins'', while the former may be due to [[Matthew 6:14]] (immediately after the text of the prayer), where Jesus speaks of ''trespasses''. As early as the third century, [[Origen of Alexandria]] used the word ''trespasses'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}}) in the prayer. Although the Latin form that was traditionally used in Western Europe has ''debita'' (''debts''), most English-speaking Christians (except Scottish Presbyterians and some others of the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] tradition) use ''trespasses''. The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the Established [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] as well as the [[Congregational]] denomination follow the version found in [[Matthew 6]] in the Authorized Version (known also as the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]), which in the prayer uses the words \"debts\" and \"debtors\".\n\nAll these versions are based on the text in Matthew, rather than Luke, of the prayer given by Jesus:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''{{bibleref2|Matthew|6:9\u201313|'''ESV'''}}''' ([[English Standard Version|ESV]])\n\n:\"Pray then like this: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

Accessed 11 Feb 2013</ref> The \"debts\" form appears in the first English translation of the Bible, by [[John Wycliffe]] in 1395 (Wycliffe spelling \"dettis\"). The \"trespasses\" version appears in the 1526 translation by [[William Tyndale]] (Tyndale spelling \"treaspases\"). In 1549 the first [[Book of Common Prayer]] in English used a version of the prayer with \"trespasses\". This became the \"official\" version used in Anglican congregations. On the other hand, the 1611 [[King James Version]], the version specifically [[Authorized Version|authorized]] for the [[Church of England]], has \"forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors\".\n\nAfter the request for bread, Matthew and Luke diverge slightly. Matthew continues with a request for [[debt]]s to be forgiven in the same manner as people have forgiven those who have debts against them. Luke, on the other hand, makes a similar request about [[sin]]s being forgiven in the manner of debts being forgiven between people. The word \"debts\" ({{lang |grc|\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}}) does not necessarily mean financial obligations, as shown by the use of the verbal form of the same word ({{lang|grc|\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5}}) in passages such as {{bibleref2|Romans|13:8}}. The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''\u1e25\u00f4b\u00e2'' can mean \"debt\" or \"sin\".<ref>Nathan Eubank 2013, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fB7YUtXPARUC&pg=PA2 Wages of Cross-Bearing and Debt of Sin]'' (Walter de Gruyter {{ISBN |978-31-1030407-7}}), p. 2</ref><ref>John S.

The generally accepted interpretation is thus that the request is for forgiveness of sin, not of supposed loans granted by God.<ref>''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', Kittel & Friedrich eds., abridged in one volume by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, Mich; 1985), pp. 746\u201350, gives use of \u1f78\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03c9 ''opheilo'' (to owe, be under obligation), \u1f78\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae ''opheile'' (debt, obligation) and two other word forms used in the New Testament and outside the New Testament, including use in Judaism.</ref> Asking for forgiveness from God was a staple of Jewish prayers.{{Citation needed |date=March 2009}} It was also considered proper for individuals to be forgiving of others, so the sentiment expressed in the prayer would have been a common one of the time.{{Citation needed|date= March 2009}}\n\n[[Anthony C. Deane]], Canon of [[Worcester Cathedral]], suggested that the choice of the word \"\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\" (debts), rather than \"\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\" (sins), indicates a reference to failures to use opportunities of doing good. He linked this with the [[The Sheep and the Goats|parable of the sheep and the goats]] (also in Matthew's Gospel), in which the grounds for condemnation are not wrongdoing in the ordinary sense, but failure to do right, missing opportunities for showing [[Charity (virtue)|love]] to others.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|25:31\u201346}}<ref>{{Citation |last= Deane |first=Anthony C. |authorlink= Anthony C.

Divergence between Matthew's \"debts\" and Luke's \"sins\" is relatively trivial compared to the impact of the second half of this statement. The verses immediately following the Lord's Prayer,{{Bibleref2c |Matt.|6:14\u201315}} show Jesus teaching that the forgiveness of our sin/debt (by God) is linked with how we forgive others, as in the [[Parable of the Unforgiving Servant]] {{Bibleref2c |Matt.|18:23\u201335}}, which Matthew gives later. [[R. T. France]] comments:\n<blockquote>\nThe point is not so much that forgiving is a prior condition of being forgiven, but that forgiving cannot be a one-way process. Like all God's gifts it brings responsibility; it must be passed on. To ask for forgiveness on any other basis is hypocrisy. There can be question, of course, of our forgiving being in proportion to what we are forgiven, as 18:23\u201335 makes clear.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttTgacXnLV8C&pg=PA137&dq=France+Matthew+%22prior+condition%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi--Zav17HkAhWjThUIHUCXB3cQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&q=France%20Matthew%20%22prior%20condition%22&f=false R.

The range of meanings of the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\" (peirasmos) is illustrated in New Testament Greek lexicons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3986 |title= Entry for Strong's #3986: ''\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2'' |website= Study Light}}</ref> In different contexts it can mean temptation, testing, trial, experiment. Although the traditional English translation uses the word \"[[temptation]]\" and [[Carl Jung]] saw God as actually leading people astray,<ref>Jung, Carl, \"Answer to Job\"</ref> Christians generally interpret the petition as not contradicting {{bibleref2 |James|1:13\u201314|ESV}}: \"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God', for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.\" Some see the petition as an eschatological appeal against unfavourable [[Last Judgment]], a theory supported by the use of the word \"peirasmos\" in this sense in {{Bibleref2 |Revelation|3:10}}. Others see it as a plea against hard ''tests'' described elsewhere in scripture, such as those of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Psalm|26:2}} and {{Bibleref2|Psalm|139:23}} are respectful challenges for a test to prove the writer's innocence and integrity.</ref> It is also read as: \"Do not let us be led (by ourselves, by others, by Satan) into temptations\". Since it follows shortly after a plea for daily bread (i.e., material sustenance), it is also seen as referring to not being caught up in the material pleasures given. A similar phrase appears in {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:41}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|22:40}} in connection with the prayer of Jesus in Gethsemane.{{sfn |Clontz|Clontz|2008|pp = 451\u201352}}\n\n[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in a translation of the Holy Bible which was not completed before his death, used: \"And suffer us not to be led into temptation\".<ref>JST Matthew 6:14</ref>\n\nIn a conversation on the Italian TV channel ''[[TV2000]]'' on 6 December 2017, [[Pope Francis]] commented that the then Italian wording of this petition (similar to the traditional English) was a poor translation.

He was referring to the 2017 change to a new [[French language|French]] version, ''Et ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation'' (\"Do not let us enter into temptation\"), but spoke of it in terms of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation, ''no nos dejes caer en la tentaci\u00f3n'' (\"do not let us fall in/into temptation\"), that he was accustomed to recite in [[Catholic Church in Argentina|Argentina]] before his election as Pope.

Later parts of Matthew refer to the devil when discussing similar issues. However, the devil is never referred to as ''the evil one'' in any known Aramaic sources. While [[John Calvin]] accepted the vagueness of the term's meaning, he considered that there is little real difference between the two interpretations, and that therefore the question is of no real consequence.

The Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] sometimes gives the Lord's Prayer with the doxology, sometimes without.<ref>For instance, in [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/principal-services/word/mornevebcp/morningbcp.aspx Morning Prayer] the doxology is included in the Lord's Prayer in the Introduction, but not in the Prayers after the Apostles' Creed.</ref> Most [[Protestant]]s append it to the Lord's Prayer.\n\n==Use as a language comparison tool==\n[[File:Lithuanian language in European language map 1741.jpg|thumb|220 px|Detail of the ''Europa Polyglotta'' published with ''[[Synopsis Universae Philologiae]]'' in 1741; the map gives the first phrase of the Lord's Prayer in 33 different [[languages of Europe]].]]\n\nIn the course of [[Christianization]], one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the Lord's Prayer, long before the full Bible would be [[Bible translations|translated into the respective languages]].\nSince the 16th century, collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a [[parallel text|quick comparison of languages]].\n\nThe first such collection, with 22 versions, was ''Mithridates, de differentiis linguarum'' by [[Conrad Gessner]] (1555; the title refers to [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] who according to [[Pliny the Elder]] was an [[Hyperpolyglot|exceptional polyglot]]).\n\nGessner's idea of collecting translations of the prayer was taken up by authors of the 17th century, including [[Hieronymus Megiserus]] (1603) and Georg Pistorius (1621).\nThomas L\u00fcdeken in 1680 published an enlarged collection of 83 versions of the prayer,<ref name=\"L\u00fcdeken\">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8NlYAAAAcAAJ&source=bl&ots=FcfMqrsJOR&sig=XTbCTk5R7c6e8alJPIt5rxNUQe4&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8pvrytbTfAhVLzoUKHVkMBFgQ6AEwBXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage Orationis dominicae versiones praeter authenticam fere centum...]'', [[Thomas L\u00fcdeken]], Officina Rungiana, 1680.</ref> of which three were in fictional [[philosophical language]]s.\nL\u00fcdeken quotes as a ''Barnum Hagius'' as his source for the exotic scripts used, while their true (anonymous) author was Andreas M\u00fcller.\nIn 1700, L\u00fcdeken's collection was re-edited by B. Mottus as ''Oratio dominica plus centum linguis versionibus aut characteribus reddita et expressa''.\nThis edition was comparatively inferior, but a second, revised edition was published in 1715 by John Chamberlain.\nThis 1715 edition was used by Gottfried Hensel in his ''[[Synopsis Universae Philologiae]]'' (1741) to compile \"geographico-polyglot maps\" where the beginning of the prayer was shown in the geographical area where the respective languages were spoken.\n[[Johann Ulrich Kraus]] also published a collection with more than 100 entries.<ref>Augustin Backer, Alois Backer, ''Biblioth\u00e8que des \u00e9crivains de la compagnie de J\u00e9sus ou notices bibliographiques'', vol. 5, 1839, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hElDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA304 304f.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lords Prayer in Chinese.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lord's Prayer in [[Classical Chinese]]]]These collections continued to be improved and expanded well into the 19th century; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] and [[Johann Severin Vater]] in 1806\u20131817 published the prayer in \"well-nigh five hundred languages and dialects\".<ref>''Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde mit dem Vater Unser als Sprachprobe in bey nahe f\u00fcnf hundert Sprachen und Mundarten'', 1806\u20131817, Berlin, Vossische Buchlandlung, 4 volumes.

Stern]]|title=Jewish New Testament Commentary|date=1992|isbn=978-9653590113|page=32}}</ref> \"Hallowed be thy name\" is reflected in the [[Kaddish]]. \"Lead us not into sin\" is echoed in the \"[[Shacharit|morning blessings]]\" of Jewish prayer. A blessing said by some Jewish communities after the [[Jewish services#Ma'ariv|evening]] ''[[Shema]]'' includes a phrase quite similar to the opening of the Lord's Prayer: \"Our God in heaven, hallow thy name, and establish thy kingdom forever, and [[Christopher Tin|rule]] over us for ever and ever. Amen.\" There are parallels also in {{Bibleref2|1Chr|29:10-18||1&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;29:10\u201318}}.{{sfn|Clontz|Clontz|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Clontz|Clontz|2008|p=451}}\n\nRabbi Aron Mendes Chumaceiro has said<ref>''Verdediging is geen aanval'' pp. 121\u2013122</ref> that nearly all the elements of the prayer have counterparts in the Jewish Bible and [[Deuterocanonical books]]: the first part in {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|63:15\u201316}} (\"Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and beautiful habitation ... For you are our Father ...\") and {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|36:23}} (\"I will vindicate the holiness of my great name ...\") and {{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|38:23}} (\"I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations ...\"), the second part in {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:21}} (\"Saviours shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom shall be the L<small>ORD</small>'s\") and {{Bibleref2|1Sam|3:18||1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;3:18}} (\"... It is the L<small>ORD</small>. Let him do what seems good to him.\"), the third part in {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|30:8}} (\"... feed me with my apportioned bread...\"), the fourth part in {{bibleverse||Sirach|28:2}} (\"Forgive your neighbour the wrong he has done, and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.\"). \"Deliver us from evil\" can be compared with {{Bibleref2|Psalm|119:133}} (\"... let no iniquity get dominion over me.\"). Chumaceiro says that, because the idea of God leading a human into temptation contradicts the righteousness and love of God, \"Lead us not into temptation\" has no counterpart in the Jewish Bible/Christian Old Testament.\n\nThe word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\", which is translated as \"temptation\", could also be translated as \"test\" or \"trial\", making evident the attitude of someone's heart. Well-known examples in the Old Testament are God's test of Abraham ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|22:1}}); his \"moving\" (the Hebrew word means basically \"to prick, as by weeds, thorns\") David to do (numbering Israel) what David later acknowledged as sin ({{Bibleref2|2Sam|24:1\u201310||2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;24:1\u201310}}; see also {{Bibleref2|1Chr|21:1-7||1&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;21:1\u20137}}); and the testing of Job in the ''[[Book of Job]]''.\n\n== Musical settings ==\nIn modern times, various composers have incorporated ''The Lord's Prayer'' into a musical setting for utilization during [[liturgical]] services for a variety of religious traditions as well as [[interfaith]] ceremonies.

{"title_page": "Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{short description|Amendment guaranteeing rights related to trials and due process}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\nThe '''Fifth Amendment'''  ('''Amendment V''') to the [[United States Constitution]] addresses [[United States constitutional criminal procedure|criminal procedure]] and other aspects of the Constitution. It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The Fifth Amendment applies to every level of the government, including the federal, state, and local levels, as well as any corporation, private enterprise, group, or individual, or any foreign government in regard to a US citizen or resident of the US. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] furthered the protections of this amendment through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nOne provision of the Fifth Amendment requires that [[felony|felonies]] be tried only upon [[indictment#United States|indictment]] by a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]]. Another provision, the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], provides the right of defendants to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The self-incrimination clause provides various protections against self-incrimination, including the right of an individual to not serve as a witness in a criminal case in which they are the defendant. \"Pleading the Fifth\" is a colloquial term often used to invoke the self-incrimination clause when witnesses decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them. In the 1966 case of ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', the Supreme Court held that the self-incrimination clause requires the police to issue a [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]] to criminal suspects interrogated while under police custody. The Fifth Amendment also contains the Takings Clause, which allows the federal government to [[eminent domain|take private property for public use]] if the government provides \"just compensation.\"\n\nLike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment includes a due process clause stating that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Fifth Amendment's due process clause applies to the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause applies to state governments. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause as providing two main protections: [[procedural due process]], which requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property, and [[substantive due process]], which protects certain [[fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental rights]] from government interference. The Supreme Court has also held that the Due Process Clause contains a [[Vagueness doctrine|prohibition against vague laws]] and an implied equal protection requirement similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].\n\n==Text==\nThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:\n{{quote|No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.}}\n{{wide image|Amendment_5.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Fifth Amendment}}\n\n==Background before adoption==\n[[File:James Madison(cropped)(c).jpg|thumb|James Madison, drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]] On June 8, 1789, Congressman [[James Madison]] introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name=speech>[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/resources/education/bill-of-rights/images/handout-2.pdf \"James Madison's Proposed Amendments to the Constitution\"], ''[[Congressional Record|Annals of Congress]]'' (June 8, 1789).</ref> His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:<ref>Obrien, David.  [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2581&context=ndlr \"Fifth Amendment: Fox Hunters, Old Women, Hermits, and the Burger Court\"], ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', Vol. 54, p. 30 (1978).</ref><ref name=speech />\n\n<blockquote>No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation....[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary....</blockquote>\n\nThis draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified.  After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the [[Grand juries in the United States#Grand Jury Clause|Grand Jury Clause]] (which Madison had placed last), the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], the [[Self-incrimination#United States law|Self Incrimination Clause]], the [[Due Process Clause]], and then the [[Takings Clause]].\n\n==Grand jury==\n{{further|Grand juries in the United States}}\nThe [[grand jury]] is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. \"Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States.\" Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. [[Grand jury|Grand juries]], which return [[indictment]]s in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given [[Jury instructions|specific instructions regarding the law]] by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], Fifth or [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth amendments]] cannot be introduced in court.<ref>''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}</ref> Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\nCurrently, federal law permits the trial of [[misdemeanor]]s without indictments.<ref>''[[Duke v. United States]]'', {{ussc|301|492|1937}}</ref> Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.\n\nGrand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In ''[[Ex Parte Bain]]'', {{ussc|121|1|1887}}, the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|471|130|1985}} partly reversed ''Ex parte Bain''; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.\n\nThe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In ''[[O'Callahan v. Parker]]'', {{ussc|395|258|1969}}, the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.<ref>''[[Solorio v. United States]]'', {{ussc|483|435|1987}}</ref>\n\nThe grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', {{ussc|110|517|1884}}</ref> This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states ''do'' employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with [[preliminary hearing]].\n\n===Infamous crime===\nWhether a crime is \"infamous\", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed;<ref>''[[Ex parte Wilson]]'', {{ussc|114|417|1885}}</ref> however, crimes punishable by [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]] must be tried upon [[indictment]]s. The historical origin of \"infamous crime\" comes from the ''[[infamia]]'', a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived of his citizenship.<ref>United States v. Cox, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&q=infamia&hl=en&as_sdt=2006#r%5B38%5D 342 F.2d 167, 187 fn.7] (5th Cir. 1965) ([[John Minor Wisdom|Wisdom]], J., specially concurring) citing Greenidge, 37.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenidge|first1=Abel Hendy Jones|authorlink=Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge|title=Infamia: Its Place in Roman Public and Private Law|date=1894|publisher=Claredon Press|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021131531|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  In ''[[United States v. Moreland]]'', {{ussc|258|433|1922}}, the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In ''[[s:Mackin v. United States|Mackin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|117|348|1886}}, the Supreme Court judged that \"'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'\", while it later in ''[[s:Green v. United States (356 U.S. 165)|Green v. United States]]'' {{ussc|356|165|1957}}, stated that \"imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year\". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the [[University of Dayton School of Law]], concluded: \"Since this is essentially the definition of a [[felony]], infamous crimes translate as felonies.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Federal Grand Jury - \"Infamous crimes\"--part 1|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/~grandjur/feedback/feedba10.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Double jeopardy==\n{{main|Double Jeopardy Clause}}\n: ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb...<ref name = \"fifth amendment double jeopardy\">{{cite book | last = Harper | first = Timothy | title = The Complete Idiot's Guide to the U.S. Constitution | publisher = Penguin Group | date = October 2, 2007 | page = 109 | isbn = 978-1-59257-627-2 |quote= \"However, the Fifth Amendment contains several other important provisions for protecting your rights.

United States]], 355 U.S. 184 (1957).</ref> In addition, the government is barred by [[collateral estoppel]] from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,<ref>[[Ashe v. Swenson]],  397 U.S. 436 (1970).</ref> even if the jury hung on other counts.<ref>[[Yeager v. United States]], 557 U.S. 110 (2009).</ref>\n\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss<ref>[[Serfass v.

Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County]], 138 F.3d 302  (7th Cir. 1998).</ref>\n\n===Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction===\nIn ''[[Blockburger v. United States]]'' (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try to punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.<ref>[[Blockburger v. United States]], 284 U.S. 299 (1932). ''See, e.g.'', [[Brown v. Ohio]], 432 U.S. 161 (1977).</ref> ''Blockburger'' is the default rule, unless the legislature intends to depart; for example, [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]] (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,<ref>[[Garrett v.

Felix]], 503 U.S. 378 (1992).</ref>\n\nThe ''Blockburger'' test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.<ref>[[Missouri v. Hunter]], 459 U.S. 359 (1983).</ref> In ''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'' (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the ''Blockburger'' test was not satisfied,<ref>[[Grady v. Corbin]], 495 U.S. 508 (1990).</ref> but ''Grady'' was overruled in ''[[United States v. Dixon]]'' (1993).<ref>[[United States v. Dixon]], 509 U.S. 688 (1993).</ref>\n\n===Prosecution after mistrial===\nThe rule for [[mistrial]]s depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith\", i.e., goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.<ref>''[[Oregon v. Kennedy]]'', 456 U.S. 667 (1982).</ref> If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial.<ref>''[[Arizona v. Washington]]'', 434 U.S. 497 (1978).</ref> The same standard governs mistrials granted ''[[sua sponte]]''.\n\n===Prosecution in different States===\n\nIn [[Heath v. Alabama]] (1985), the Supreme Court held, that the Fifth Amendment rule against double jeopardy does not prohibit two different states from separately prosecuting and convicting the same individual for the same illegal act.\n\n==Self-incrimination==\n{{redirect|Plead the Fifth|the album by the band Taproot|Plead the Fifth (album)}}\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to [[self-incrimination|incriminate themselves]]. Incriminating oneself is defined as exposing oneself (or another person) to \"an accusation or charge of crime,\" or as involving oneself (or another person) \"in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof.\"<ref>''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 690 (5th ed. 1979).</ref> The ''privilege'' against compelled self-incrimination is defined as \"the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself.&nbsp;... \"<ref>From \"Self-Incrimination, Privilege Against,\" ''Barrons Law Dictionary'', p. 434 (2d ed. 1984).</ref> To \"plead the Fifth\" is to refuse to answer any question because \"the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked\" lead a claimant to possess a \"reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer\", believing that \"a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\"<ref>''Ohio v.

Refusal to take this oath usually was regarded as proof of guilt.}}</ref> Anyone refusing to take the oath ''ex officio mero'' (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty.<ref name=\"[[ex-officio-mero]]\" /> Suspected [[Puritans]] were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel \"cooperation.\" Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the [[New World]], began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case [[John Lilburne]] refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for \"[[freeborn]] rights\" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the [[Levellers]]. The Levellers presented ''The Humble Petition of Many Thousands'' to [[Parliament]] in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.\n\nProtection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the [[Miranda rights]] statement, which protects the \"right to remain silent.\" This amendment is also similar to [[Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries like [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.\n\nIn [[South Africa]]n law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"<ref>''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, Professor James Duane of the [[Regent University]] School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision in ''Salinas v. Texas'',<ref> {{ussc|570|12-246|2013}}.</ref> significantly weakened the privilege, saying \"our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/law-professor-police-interrogation-law-constitution-survival |title=A Law Professor Explains Why You Should Never Talk to Police |publisher=Vice.com |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Salinas'' case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that \"the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection.\"\n\nJustice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, \"Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony.\" Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/supreme-court-hands-down-three-decisions-that-are-5-to-4.html\n|title=A 5-4 Ruling, One of Three, Limits Silence\u2019s Protection |work=New York Times |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legal proceedings and congressional hearings===\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding.<ref>See, e.g., Rule 608(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, as amended through Dec. 1, 2012.</ref> The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the [[incorporation doctrine]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,<ref>Michael J. Z. Mannheimer, \"Ripeness of Self-Incrimination Clause Disputes,\" ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', Vol. 95, No. 4, p. 1261, footnote 1 (Northwestern Univ.

Arndstein]]'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)).</ref>\n\nThe right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] or the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the [[Communist Party]]. Under the [[Red Scare]] hysteria at the time of [[McCarthyism]], witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as \"fifth amendment communists\". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after \"taking the Fifth.\"\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisc.) asked, \"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party,\" while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to \"name names,\" to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. [[Academy Award]] winning director [[Elia Kazan]] testified before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also \"named names,\" which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as [[Zero Mostel]] found themselves on a [[Hollywood blacklist]] after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} since being a Communist itself was not a crime.\n\nThe amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the [[American Mafia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Statements made to non-governmental entities===\nThe privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO), such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See ''United States v. Solomon'',<ref>509 F. 2d 863 (2d Cir. 1975).</ref> ''D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.'',<ref>132 F. Supp. 2d 248, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 279 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2002), ''cert. denied'', 537 U.S. 1028 (2002).</ref> and ''Marchiano v. NASD''.<ref>134 F. Supp. 2d 90, 95 (D.D.C. 2001).</ref> SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.\n\n===Custodial interrogation===\nThe Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at [[common law]], even a confession obtained by [[torture]] was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'', {{ussc|297|278|1936}}.\n\nLaw enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'' (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In ''[[Ashcraft v. Tennessee (1944)|Ashcraft v. Tennessee]]'' (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In ''Haynes v. Washington'',<ref>373 U.S. 503 (1963).</ref> the Court held that an \"unfair and inherently coercive context\" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.\n\n''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. [[Ernesto Miranda]] had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.\n\nThe Court held \"the prosecution may not use statements&nbsp;... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.\n\nAs for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" The warning to which Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] referred is now called the [[Miranda warning]], and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.\n\n''Miranda'' has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under \"custodial\" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the ''reasonable belief'' that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in \"custody.\" That determination of \"reasonableness\" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (2004), the Court held that \"a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable\".<ref name=jdb>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf ''J.D.B. v. North Carolina''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 16, 2011, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> In her concurring opinion [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote that a suspect's age may indeed \"be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry\";<ref name=alvarado>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1684.ZC.html ''Yarborough v. Alvarado''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 1, 2004, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of ''Alvarado''. The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'' where they ruled that \"so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test\".<ref name=jdb />\n\nThe questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.\n\nA confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to \"impeach\" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.\n\nIn ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' [[stop and identify statutes]] is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.\n\n==== Explicit invocation ====\n\nIn June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Kennedy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1470.ZO.html |title=Berghuis v. Thompkins |work=Law.cornell.edu |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref> Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to  assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in ''[[w:Berghuis v. Thompkins#Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas|Salinas v. Texas]]'' in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no \"ritualistic formula\" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so \"by simply standing mute.\"<ref>See ''Salinas v. Texas'', no. 12-246, U.S. Supreme Court (June 17, 2013).</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mukasey|first=Marc L.|title=Salinas v.

See ''[[United States v. Hubbell]]''. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',<ref>116 U.S. 616 (1886).</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove\".\n\n====By corporations====\nCorporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to \"natural persons.\"<ref>''U.S. v. Kordel'', {{ussc|397|1|1970}}.</ref>  The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents ''even'' if the act of production would incriminate him personally.<ref>''Braswell v. U.S.'', {{ussc|487|99|1988}}.</ref>  The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.\n\n===Refusal to testify in a criminal case===\nIn ''[[Griffin v. California]]'' (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's [[right to silence|refusal to testify]] in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.<ref>{{Ussc|380|609|1965}}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to testify in a civil case===\nWhile defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" ''Baxter v. Palmigiano'',<ref>425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).</ref> \"[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the ''Tod'' case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'\"<ref>Id. at 319 (quoting ''United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod'', 263 U.S. 149, 153\u2013154 (1923)).</ref> \"'Failure to contest an assertion&nbsp;... is considered evidence of acquiescence&nbsp;... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'\"<ref>Id. (quoting ''United States v. Hale'', 422 U.S. 171, 176 (1975)).</ref>\n\nIn ''Baxter'', the state was entitled to an adverse inference against Palmigiano because of the evidence against him and his assertion of the Fifth Amendment right.\n\nSome civil cases are considered \"criminal cases\" for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in personam, is a \"criminal case\" within the meaning of that part of the Fifth Amendment which declares that no person \"shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/116/616/case.html|title=Boyd v.

In ''United States v. Sullivan'',<ref>{{Ussc|274|259|1927}}.</ref> the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: \"If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld.\"<ref>''United States v. Sullivan'', 274 U.S. 259 (1927).</ref>\n\nIn ''Garner v. United States'',<ref>{{Ussc|424|648|1976}}.</ref> the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to \"fix\" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \"professional gambler.\" In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \"gambling\" or \"wagering.\" The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|illegal income]] on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that \"if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself.\"<ref>''Garner v. United States'', 424 U.S. 648 (1976).</ref>\n\n''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'' are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item \"Fifth Amendment\" (instead of \"illegal gambling income,\" \"illegal drug sales,\" etc.)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miniter |first1=Frank |title=Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2011 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 204] |isbn=978-1-59698-150-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 }}</ref> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: \"Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported.\"<ref>''United States v. Pilcher'', 672 F.2d 875 (11th Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 459 U.S. 973 (1982).</ref> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: \".&nbsp;... the ''amount'' of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the ''source'' of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws \"by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form.\"<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 585 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1978), ''cert. denied'', 440 U.S. 928 (1979) (italics in original).</ref> In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: \"While the ''source'' of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the ''amount'' of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it.\"<ref>''United States v. Johnson'', 577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978) (italics in original).</ref> In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: \"A careful reading of ''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'', therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income.\"<ref>''United States v. Brown'', 600 F.2d 248 (10th Cir. 1979).</ref>\n\n===Grants of immunity===\nIf the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be \"transactional immunity\" or \"use immunity\"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In ''[[Kastigar v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|406|441|1972}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to [[organized crime]].\n\n===Record keeping===\nA statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by ''[[Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board]]'',<ref>382 U.S. 70 (1965).</ref> is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper.  In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] requiring members of the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was \"directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\"\n\nIn ''[[Leary v. United States]]'',<ref>395 U.S. 6 (1969).</ref> the court struck down the [[Marijuana Tax Act]] because its record keeping statute required [[self-incrimination]].\n\nIn ''[[Haynes v. United States]]'',<ref>390 U.S. 85 (1968).</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of [[self-incrimination]] and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n===Combinations and passwords===\nWhile no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over \"the contents of his own mind\", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Blackmun |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/201#writing-type-1-BLACKMUN |title=John Doe v.

In ''Boucher'', production of the unencrypted drive was deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the defendant.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=[[In re Boucher|In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher]] |vol= |reporter= |opinion=No. 2:06-mj-91, 2009 WL 424718 |pinpoint= |court=D.

This provision of the Fifth Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, but the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1897 case ''[[Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago|Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago]]'' that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes \"public use\". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.\n\nThe owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the [[fair market value]] of the property determines \"just compensation\".

This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]].'' This 5\u20134 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that \"the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.\" Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not \"of primary benefit to&nbsp;... the developer\" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that \"Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.\" She argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and [[public use]] of property\u2014and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". A number of states, in response to ''Kelo'', have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not \"for public use\" are not directly covered by the doctrine,<ref>''See'' [[Berman v. Parker]].</ref> however such a taking might violate [[Due process in the United States|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]], or other applicable law.\n\nThe exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or \"taken\" as a result of police action.<ref>''Wegner v.Milwaukee Mutual, City of Minneapolis'' 479 N.W.2d 38 (Minn. 1991) and ''Steele v.

In ''[[United States v. 50 Acres of Land]] (1984)'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] wrote that \"The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by \"the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money.\" ''[[Olson v. United States]]'', 292 U.S. 246 (1934) &nbsp;... Deviation from this measure of just compensation has been required only \"when market value has been too difficult to find, or when its application would result in manifest injustice to owner or public.\" ''[[United States v.

It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The Fifth Amendment applies to every level of the government, including the federal, state, and local levels, as well as any corporation, private enterprise, group, or individual, or any foreign government in regard to a US citizen or resident of the US. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] furthered the protections of this amendment through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nOne provision of the Fifth Amendment requires that [[felony|felonies]] be tried only upon [[indictment#United States|indictment]] by a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]]. Another provision, the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], provides the right of defendants to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The self-incrimination clause provides various protections against self-incrimination, including the right of an individual to not serve as a witness in a criminal case in which they are the defendant. \"Pleading the Fifth\" is a colloquial term often used to invoke the self-incrimination clause when witnesses decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them. In the 1966 case of ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', the Supreme Court held that the self-incrimination clause requires the police to issue a [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]] to criminal suspects interrogated while under police custody. The Fifth Amendment also contains the Takings Clause, which allows the federal government to [[eminent domain|take private property for public use]] if the government provides \"just compensation.\"\n\nLike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment includes a due process clause stating that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Fifth Amendment's due process clause applies to the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause applies to state governments. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause as providing two main protections: [[procedural due process]], which requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property, and [[substantive due process]], which protects certain [[fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental rights]] from government interference. The Supreme Court has also held that the Due Process Clause contains a [[Vagueness doctrine|prohibition against vague laws]] and an implied equal protection requirement similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].\n\n==Text==\nThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:\n{{quote|No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.}}\n{{wide image|Amendment_5.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Fifth Amendment}}\n\n==Background before adoption==\n[[File:James Madison(cropped)(c).jpg|thumb|James Madison, drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]] On June 8, 1789, Congressman [[James Madison]] introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name=speech>[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/resources/education/bill-of-rights/images/handout-2.pdf \"James Madison's Proposed Amendments to the Constitution\"], ''[[Congressional Record|Annals of Congress]]'' (June 8, 1789).</ref> His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:<ref>Obrien, David.  [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2581&context=ndlr \"Fifth Amendment: Fox Hunters, Old Women, Hermits, and the Burger Court\"], ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', Vol. 54, p. 30 (1978).</ref><ref name=speech />\n\n<blockquote>No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation....[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary....</blockquote>\n\nThis draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified.  After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the [[Grand juries in the United States#Grand Jury Clause|Grand Jury Clause]] (which Madison had placed last), the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], the [[Self-incrimination#United States law|Self Incrimination Clause]], the [[Due Process Clause]], and then the [[Takings Clause]].\n\n==Grand jury==\n{{further|Grand juries in the United States}}\nThe [[grand jury]] is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. \"Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States.\" Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. [[Grand jury|Grand juries]], which return [[indictment]]s in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given [[Jury instructions|specific instructions regarding the law]] by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], Fifth or [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth amendments]] cannot be introduced in court.<ref>''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}</ref> Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\nCurrently, federal law permits the trial of [[misdemeanor]]s without indictments.<ref>''[[Duke v. United States]]'', {{ussc|301|492|1937}}</ref> Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.\n\nGrand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In ''[[Ex Parte Bain]]'', {{ussc|121|1|1887}}, the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|471|130|1985}} partly reversed ''Ex parte Bain''; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.\n\nThe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In ''[[O'Callahan v. Parker]]'', {{ussc|395|258|1969}}, the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.<ref>''[[Solorio v. United States]]'', {{ussc|483|435|1987}}</ref>\n\nThe grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', {{ussc|110|517|1884}}</ref> This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states ''do'' employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with [[preliminary hearing]].\n\n===Infamous crime===\nWhether a crime is \"infamous\", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed;<ref>''[[Ex parte Wilson]]'', {{ussc|114|417|1885}}</ref> however, crimes punishable by [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]] must be tried upon [[indictment]]s. The historical origin of \"infamous crime\" comes from the ''[[infamia]]'', a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived of his citizenship.<ref>United States v. Cox, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&q=infamia&hl=en&as_sdt=2006#r%5B38%5D 342 F.2d 167, 187 fn.7] (5th Cir. 1965) ([[John Minor Wisdom|Wisdom]], J., specially concurring) citing Greenidge, 37.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenidge|first1=Abel Hendy Jones|authorlink=Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge|title=Infamia: Its Place in Roman Public and Private Law|date=1894|publisher=Claredon Press|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021131531|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  In ''[[United States v. Moreland]]'', {{ussc|258|433|1922}}, the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In ''[[s:Mackin v. United States|Mackin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|117|348|1886}}, the Supreme Court judged that \"'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'\", while it later in ''[[s:Green v. United States (356 U.S. 165)|Green v. United States]]'' {{ussc|356|165|1957}}, stated that \"imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year\". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the [[University of Dayton School of Law]], concluded: \"Since this is essentially the definition of a [[felony]], infamous crimes translate as felonies.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Federal Grand Jury - \"Infamous crimes\"--part 1|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/~grandjur/feedback/feedba10.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Double jeopardy==\n{{main|Double Jeopardy Clause}}\n: ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb...<ref name = \"fifth amendment double jeopardy\">{{cite book | last = Harper | first = Timothy | title = The Complete Idiot's Guide to the U.S. Constitution | publisher = Penguin Group | date = October 2, 2007 | page = 109 | isbn = 978-1-59257-627-2 |quote= \"However, the Fifth Amendment contains several other important provisions for protecting your rights.

Refusal to take this oath usually was regarded as proof of guilt.}}</ref> Anyone refusing to take the oath ''ex officio mero'' (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty.<ref name=\"[[ex-officio-mero]]\" /> Suspected [[Puritans]] were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel \"cooperation.\" Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the [[New World]], began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case [[John Lilburne]] refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for \"[[freeborn]] rights\" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the [[Levellers]]. The Levellers presented ''The Humble Petition of Many Thousands'' to [[Parliament]] in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.\n\nProtection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the [[Miranda rights]] statement, which protects the \"right to remain silent.\" This amendment is also similar to [[Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries like [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.\n\nIn [[South Africa]]n law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"<ref>''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, Professor James Duane of the [[Regent University]] School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision in ''Salinas v. Texas'',<ref> {{ussc|570|12-246|2013}}.</ref> significantly weakened the privilege, saying \"our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/law-professor-police-interrogation-law-constitution-survival |title=A Law Professor Explains Why You Should Never Talk to Police |publisher=Vice.com |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Salinas'' case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that \"the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection.\"\n\nJustice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, \"Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony.\" Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/supreme-court-hands-down-three-decisions-that-are-5-to-4.html\n|title=A 5-4 Ruling, One of Three, Limits Silence\u2019s Protection |work=New York Times |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legal proceedings and congressional hearings===\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding.<ref>See, e.g., Rule 608(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, as amended through Dec. 1, 2012.</ref> The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the [[incorporation doctrine]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,<ref>Michael J. Z. Mannheimer, \"Ripeness of Self-Incrimination Clause Disputes,\" ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', Vol. 95, No. 4, p. 1261, footnote 1 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law 2005), citing ''[[Malloy v. Hogan]]'', {{Ussc|378|1|1964}}).</ref> and whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.<ref>''[[McCarthy v. Arndstein]]'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)).</ref>\n\nThe right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] or the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the [[Communist Party]]. Under the [[Red Scare]] hysteria at the time of [[McCarthyism]], witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as \"fifth amendment communists\". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after \"taking the Fifth.\"\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisc.) asked, \"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party,\" while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to \"name names,\" to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. [[Academy Award]] winning director [[Elia Kazan]] testified before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also \"named names,\" which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as [[Zero Mostel]] found themselves on a [[Hollywood blacklist]] after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} since being a Communist itself was not a crime.\n\nThe amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the [[American Mafia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Statements made to non-governmental entities===\nThe privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO), such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See ''United States v. Solomon'',<ref>509 F. 2d 863 (2d Cir. 1975).</ref> ''D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.'',<ref>132 F. Supp. 2d 248, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 279 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2002), ''cert. denied'', 537 U.S. 1028 (2002).</ref> and ''Marchiano v. NASD''.<ref>134 F. Supp. 2d 90, 95 (D.D.C. 2001).</ref> SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.\n\n===Custodial interrogation===\nThe Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at [[common law]], even a confession obtained by [[torture]] was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'', {{ussc|297|278|1936}}.\n\nLaw enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'' (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In ''[[Ashcraft v. Tennessee (1944)|Ashcraft v. Tennessee]]'' (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In ''Haynes v. Washington'',<ref>373 U.S. 503 (1963).</ref> the Court held that an \"unfair and inherently coercive context\" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.\n\n''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. [[Ernesto Miranda]] had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.\n\nThe Court held \"the prosecution may not use statements&nbsp;... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.\n\nAs for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" The warning to which Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] referred is now called the [[Miranda warning]], and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.\n\n''Miranda'' has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under \"custodial\" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the ''reasonable belief'' that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in \"custody.\" That determination of \"reasonableness\" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (2004), the Court held that \"a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable\".<ref name=jdb>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf ''J.D.B. v. North Carolina''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 16, 2011, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> In her concurring opinion [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote that a suspect's age may indeed \"be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry\";<ref name=alvarado>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1684.ZC.html ''Yarborough v. Alvarado''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 1, 2004, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of ''Alvarado''. The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'' where they ruled that \"so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test\".<ref name=jdb />\n\nThe questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.\n\nA confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to \"impeach\" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.\n\nIn ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' [[stop and identify statutes]] is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.\n\n==== Explicit invocation ====\n\nIn June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Kennedy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1470.ZO.html |title=Berghuis v. Thompkins |work=Law.cornell.edu |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref> Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to  assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in ''[[w:Berghuis v. Thompkins#Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas|Salinas v. Texas]]'' in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no \"ritualistic formula\" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so \"by simply standing mute.\"<ref>See ''Salinas v.

See ''[[United States v. Hubbell]]''. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',<ref>116 U.S. 616 (1886).</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove\".\n\n====By corporations====\nCorporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to \"natural persons.\"<ref>''U.S. v. Kordel'', {{ussc|397|1|1970}}.</ref>  The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents ''even'' if the act of production would incriminate him personally.<ref>''Braswell v. U.S.'', {{ussc|487|99|1988}}.</ref>  The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.\n\n===Refusal to testify in a criminal case===\nIn ''[[Griffin v. California]]'' (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's [[right to silence|refusal to testify]] in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.<ref>{{Ussc|380|609|1965}}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to testify in a civil case===\nWhile defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" ''Baxter v. Palmigiano'',<ref>425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).</ref> \"[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the ''Tod'' case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'\"<ref>Id. at 319 (quoting ''United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod'', 263 U.S. 149, 153\u2013154 (1923)).</ref> \"'Failure to contest an assertion&nbsp;... is considered evidence of acquiescence&nbsp;... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'\"<ref>Id.

In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in personam, is a \"criminal case\" within the meaning of that part of the Fifth Amendment which declares that no person \"shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/116/616/case.html|title=Boyd v.

In ''United States v. Sullivan'',<ref>{{Ussc|274|259|1927}}.</ref> the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: \"If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld.\"<ref>''United States v. Sullivan'', 274 U.S. 259 (1927).</ref>\n\nIn ''Garner v. United States'',<ref>{{Ussc|424|648|1976}}.</ref> the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to \"fix\" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \"professional gambler.\" In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \"gambling\" or \"wagering.\" The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|illegal income]] on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that \"if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself.\"<ref>''Garner v. United States'', 424 U.S. 648 (1976).</ref>\n\n''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'' are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item \"Fifth Amendment\" (instead of \"illegal gambling income,\" \"illegal drug sales,\" etc.)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miniter |first1=Frank |title=Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2011 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 204] |isbn=978-1-59698-150-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 }}</ref> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: \"Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported.\"<ref>''United States v. Pilcher'', 672 F.2d 875 (11th Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 459 U.S. 973 (1982).</ref> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: \".&nbsp;... the ''amount'' of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the ''source'' of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws \"by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form.\"<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 585 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1978), ''cert. denied'', 440 U.S. 928 (1979) (italics in original).</ref> In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: \"While the ''source'' of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the ''amount'' of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it.\"<ref>''United States v. Johnson'', 577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978) (italics in original).</ref> In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: \"A careful reading of ''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'', therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income.\"<ref>''United States v. Brown'', 600 F.2d 248 (10th Cir. 1979).</ref>\n\n===Grants of immunity===\nIf the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be \"transactional immunity\" or \"use immunity\"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In ''[[Kastigar v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|406|441|1972}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to [[organized crime]].\n\n===Record keeping===\nA statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by ''[[Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board]]'',<ref>382 U.S. 70 (1965).</ref> is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper.  In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] requiring members of the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was \"directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\"\n\nIn ''[[Leary v. United States]]'',<ref>395 U.S. 6 (1969).</ref> the court struck down the [[Marijuana Tax Act]] because its record keeping statute required [[self-incrimination]].\n\nIn ''[[Haynes v. United States]]'',<ref>390 U.S. 85 (1968).</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of [[self-incrimination]] and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n===Combinations and passwords===\nWhile no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over \"the contents of his own mind\", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Blackmun |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/201#writing-type-1-BLACKMUN |title=John Doe v.

In ''Boucher'', production of the unencrypted drive was deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the defendant.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=[[In re Boucher|In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher]] |vol= |reporter= |opinion=No. 2:06-mj-91, 2009 WL 424718 |pinpoint= |court=D.

This provision of the Fifth Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, but the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1897 case ''[[Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago|Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago]]'' that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes \"public use\". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.\n\nThe owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the [[fair market value]] of the property determines \"just compensation\". If the property is taken before the payment is made, interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term \"interest\"). \n\nProperty under the Fifth Amend includes [[Contract|contractual rights]] stemming from contracts between the United States, a [[U.S. state]] or any of its subdivisions and the other contract partner(s), because contractual rights are property rights for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Stoltzfus Jost (Professor of Law at the Washington and Lee University School of \nLaw)|title=The Operation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Risk Corridor Program, p. 5 and 6 with reference to the United States Supreme case ''Lynch v.

United States'', 292 U.S. 571 (1934) that valid contracts of the United States are property, and the rights of private individuals arising out of them are protected by the Fifth Amendment. The court stated said:\"''The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just compensation.  Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a state, or the United States. Rights against the United States arising out of a contract with it are protected by the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Central Pacific R. Co., 118 U. S. 235, 118 U. S. 238; United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 256 U. S. 51, 256 U. S. 64, 256 U. S. 67.

This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]].'' This 5\u20134 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that \"the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.\" Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not \"of primary benefit to&nbsp;... the developer\" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that \"Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.\" She argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and [[public use]] of property\u2014and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". A number of states, in response to ''Kelo'', have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not \"for public use\" are not directly covered by the doctrine,<ref>''See'' [[Berman v. Parker]].</ref> however such a taking might violate [[Due process in the United States|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]], or other applicable law.\n\nThe exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or \"taken\" as a result of police action.<ref>''Wegner v.Milwaukee Mutual, City of Minneapolis'' 479 N.W.2d 38 (Minn. 1991) and ''Steele v. City of Houston'' 603 S.W.2d 786 (1980)</ref>\n\n===\"Just compensation\"===\nThe last two words of the amendment promise \"just compensation\" for takings by the government. In ''[[United States v. 50 Acres of Land]] (1984)'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] wrote that \"The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by \"the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money.\" ''[[Olson v. United States]]'', 292 U.S. 246 (1934) &nbsp;... Deviation from this measure of just compensation has been required only \"when market value has been too difficult to find, or when its application would result in manifest injustice to owner or public.\" ''[[United States v.
