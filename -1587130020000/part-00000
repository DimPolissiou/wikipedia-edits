Most recently, Spotnitz co-created and executive produced ''Leonardo'', which is currently in production in Italy. \n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in Camp Zama, Japan, in 1960, Spotnitz\u2019s father was a doctor in the US Army. Much of his childhood was peripatetic before the family settled in Phoenix, Arizona. As a child, Spotnitz consumed television shows and films as much as he could, sometimes watching the same film two or three times in a row. \n\nSpotnitz\u2019s education at Camelback High School inspired him to pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\nSpotnitz graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) with a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1982, where he was a reporter for the [[Daily Bruin]]. He later received a [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in screenwriting from the [[AFI Conservatory]] in 1989.\n\n==Career==\n<big>'''Journalism'''</big>  \n\nUpon graduation, Spotnitz was employed as a wire-service reporter for the [[United Press International]] in Indianapolis and New York. He also briefly worked for the [[Associated Press]] in Paris. Spotnitz freelanced for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' before returning to his passion and studying screenwriting at [[American Film Institute|AFI]].  \n\n'''<big>Television</big>'''  \n\nSpotnitz created, executive produced and wrote several episodes of ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'', based on the classic alternative history novel by Philip K. Dick, which upon its release became Amazon\u2019s most viewed series ever. Starring Alexa Davalos, Rufus Sewell and Joel de la Fuente, the series explores life in a 1962 America where the Allies lost the war and the country is divided between the fascist Japanese in the West and the Nazis in the East. The series won two Emmy Awards, was nominated for two others, and named Best Drama Series at the Roma Fiction Festival. It was also nominated for an ASC Award for Outstanding Cinematography, the USC Scripter Award and Best Drama at Monte Carlo Television Festival\u2019s Golden Nymph Awards.   \n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''Leonardo'', currently in production. The eight-part limited series shows the terrible personal sacrifice that led ''Leonardo'' to create masterpieces that changed the way we see the world forever. Starring [[Aidan Turner]] and [[Freddie Highmore]], the series is the first produced by The Alliance (RAI, France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision, ZDF).\n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: Masters of Florence'', starring Richard Madden, Dustin Hoffman and Annabel Scholey. Chronicling the rise of the Medici family during the Italian Renaissance, it shows how the family\u2019s ascent from simple merchants to power brokers sparked an economic and cultural revolution, creating powerful enemies in the process. The Netflix Original Series was produced with Lux Vide Productions for RAI, Italy\u2019s largest broadcaster, and SFR in France. The RAI premiere attracted a record-breaking seven million viewers in Italy, becoming the country\u2019s most-watched new series. \n\nSet 20 years later, ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' starred Daniel Sharman, Bradley James and Sean Bean, and was also co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. After an attempt on Piero de Medici\u2019s life, his son Lorenzo is forced to assume leadership of the family-run bank. Once in power, young Lorenzo resolves to abandon the cynical politics of the past to usher in a new era of creative and political revolution, bringing him into open conflict with rival banker Jacopo Pazzi, who will stop at nothing to defeat him. Their clash gives rise to one of the most thrilling true-life political intrigues of all time, the infamous Pazzi conspiracy. The second season of ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' was broadcast on RAI in December 2019 and premieres as a Netflix Original Series in May.\n\nIn 2017, Spotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote the comedy-drama series ''[[The Indian Detective]]'' for Canadian broadcaster CTV and Netflix. It starred international comedy sensation Russell Peters, whom Forbes magazine ranked three times in its Top 10 highest-grossing comics list. Peters portrays Doug D\u2019Mello, a charming, smart Toronto cop, who unexpectedly finds himself investigating murder in his parents\u2019 Indian homeland, where, despite his heritage, he remains an outsider. Canada\u2019s biggest series debut in two years was the second-most watched programme on the day of its CTV premiere, with 1.6 million viewers. It was bestowed the Golden Screen Award by the Canadian Screen Academy.\n\n''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]'', produced for CBS in the US, France\u2019s TF1, Canada\u2019s Corus/Global and RTL in Germany, was a suspense drama set against an international backdrop. It starred [[Luke Roberts (actor)|Luke Roberts]] and was co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. The thriller follows crisis and hostage negotiator Eric Beaumont, whose team is brought in to save lives when no one else can. Beaumont understands criminals better than they understand themselves and uses his insight into human behaviour to resolve the most difficult kidnap and ransom cases. Despite the stakes, Beaumont refuses to resort to violence, even when confronted by some of the world\u2019s most dangerous criminals. ''Ransom'' was VOX Germany\u2019s highest rated drama premiere for over 15 months and France\u2019s TF1 premiere reached over 4 million viewers for a market share of 25%. The show ran for three seasons.\n\nIn 2012, Spotnitz created, wrote and executive produced the international spy drama series ''[[Hunted (2012 TV series)|Hunted]]'' for BBC1 and HBO/Cinemax, starring [[Melissa George]], [[Adam Rayner]], [[Stephen Dillane]] and [[Patrick Malahide]]. \u00a0The series follows Sam Hunter, an operative for a private spy agency, Byzantium. After she is betrayed and nearly killed by one of her colleagues, Sam returns to London in an attempt to root out the traitor, while working undercover in the home of a wealthy and dangerous London gangster on an assignment that could cost her life. The series was BAFTA nominated for cinematography and won the ASC Award. It was also nominated for Best Editing by the Royal Television Society.\n\nSpotnitz served on ''[[The X-Files]]'' for eight of its nine seasons after joining the show in 1994. He called it \u201ca life-changing experience\u201d, graduating from staff writer to executive producer after three seasons. He directed two episodes and wrote or co-wrote more than 40 instalments of the series, including the Emmy-nominated \u201cMemento Mori\u201d with [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]],[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[John Shiban]] in 1997.

Spotnitz shares three Golden Globes for Best Dramatic Series and a Peabody Award for his work on ''[[The X-Files]]''.

Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, 7th IDF Chief of Staff in photos (17).jpg|thumb|right|Ben Gurion (holding field glasses) in 1948. Standing behind him is [[Yitzhak Rabin]]; to his left is [[Yigal Allon]].]]\n'''The Generals' Revolt''' was a series of confrontations between [[David Ben-Gurion]] and generals of the newly-formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) in 1948, on the eve of the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. \n\nThe backdrop to the dispute was Ben Gurion's insistence on having commanders from his own [[Mapai]] party appointed to senior posts in the IDF. It mostly centered upon [[Israel Galili]], the [[Mapam]] Head of National Command, who was finally unseated by Ben-Gurion in June in the midst of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war]].\n\n==History==\nBen-Gurion had three objectives: Replacing the existing Yishuv structures of control over the Haganah and replacing them with a centralised chain of command; dissolving units connected with political movements and creating a unified national army; and building an army based on the [[British Army]] model, breaking with the [[Palmach]] \"revolutionary army\" tradition.\n\nIn 1946 Ben-Gurion tried to appoint loyal supporters into the upper echelons of the Haganah but was unsuccessful. The following year, there was a debate within the defence establishment about what form of armed forces the [[Yishuv]] should have in the anticipated conflict.

This post was held by [[Israel Galili]], one of the leaders of [[Mapam]], the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rivals to Ben-Gurion's [[Mapai]] party. On 26 April Ben-Gurion notified Galili of the decision.

The staff of the security forces will henceforth receive its instructions exclusively from the director of security [Ben-Gurion himself] or his representative.\"</blockquote>\n\nA majority of senior IDF officers at that time were from Mapam, and the response from several of them was to threaten to resign.

Standing behind him is [[Yitzhak Rabin]]; to his left is [[Yigal Allon]].]]\n'''The Generals' Revolt''' was a series of confrontations between [[David Ben-Gurion]] and generals of the newly-formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) in 1948, on the eve of the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. \n\nThe backdrop to the dispute was Ben Gurion's insistence on having commanders from his own [[Mapai]] party appointed to senior posts in the IDF. It mostly centered upon [[Israel Galili]], the [[Mapam]] Head of National Command, who was finally unseated by Ben-Gurion in June in the midst of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]].\n\n==History==\nBen-Gurion had three objectives: Replacing the existing Yishuv structures of control over the Haganah and replacing them with a centralised chain of command; dissolving units connected with political movements and creating a unified national army; and building an army based on the [[British Army]] model, breaking with the [[Palmach]] \"revolutionary army\" tradition.\n\nIn 1946 Ben-Gurion tried to appoint loyal supporters into the upper echelons of the Haganah but was unsuccessful. The following year, there was a debate within the defence establishment about what form of armed forces the [[Yishuv]] should have in the anticipated conflict. Ben-Gurion proposed an entirely new organisation to replace the Haganah, modelled on the [[British Army]]. These new ideas shocked the Haganah leadership. The Haganah had not been active since withdrawing from direct action against the British authorities in July 1946, and the crisis threatened morale within Haganah units.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">{{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}}</ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen. \n\nFor reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see [[Blood gas tension]]).<ref name=\"Yacov2017\">  {{Cite book | authors= Yacov R, Derek K and Namasivayam A| title= Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (sixth edition)| year=2017 | chapter=Chapter 10 \u2013 Blood gases: technical aspects and interpretation | publisher=Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-323-39006-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Oxygen exchange in the womb==\nDuring pregnancy, the mother\u2019s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

Each value of the internal state is then mapped to one pseudorandom sample. Normally the [[Transition system|state transition function]] is complicated and the function mapping state to a sample is simple. In the case of counter-based generators the internal state is just an integer counter. The state transition function is an increment by one. The complexity comes in the map from the state to the random sample.\n\nBecause the state is just a counter it is trivial to split [[random number generation]] between parallel processors without overlap. Skip-a-head and rewind in the stream of generated random numbers also become trivial ''O''(1) operations. It is easy to organize different numbers of parallel processors to generate the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers.\n\nThe technique was proposed by a group at [[D. E.

Each value of the internal state is then mapped to one pseudorandom sample. Normally the [[Transition system|state transition function]] is complicated and the function mapping state to a sample is simple. In the case of counter-based generators the internal state is just an integer counter. The state transition function is an increment by one. The complexity comes in the map from the state to the random sample.\n\nBecause the state is just a counter it is trivial to split [[random number generation]] between parallel processors without overlap. Skip-a-head and rewind in the stream of generated random numbers also become trivial ''O''(1) operations. It is easy to organize different numbers of parallel processors to generate the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers.\n\nThe technique was proposed by a group at [[D. E.
