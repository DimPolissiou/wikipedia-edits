In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side.

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III-24}} On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]].

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight. Astronauts entered the Spacelab module through a {{convert|8.72|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} or {{convert|18.88|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tunnel that connected to the airlock.

The Spacelab module was tested STS-2 and STS-3, and the first full mission was on [[STS-9]].<ref name=NASA28>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/msad15mar99_1/ |title=Spacelab joined diverse scientists and disciplines on 28 Shuttle missions|last=Dooling|first=Dave |publisher=NASA |date=March 15, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====RS-25 engines====\n{{main|RS-25}}\n[[File:STS-133 Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver 3.jpg|thumb|[[RS-25]] engines with the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods]]\n\nThree RS-25 engines, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013177\u2013183}}\n\nThe RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013112\u2013113}} The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection for temperatures below {{convert|1200|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below {{convert|700|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|395}}\n\n===External tank===\n{{main|Space Shuttle external tank}}\n[[File:STS-29 External Tanker Separation.jpg|thumb|The external tank after separation on [[STS-29]]]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle external tank carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The external tank was {{convert|153.8|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|27.6|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogren (LH<sub>2</sub>). The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]]. The Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.<ref name=\"ShuttleByNumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon |publisher=Space.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author=Malik, Tarik}}</ref>\n\nShuttle components include the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne [[RS-25]] main engines, a pair of recoverable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs), and the expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{efn|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III-24}} On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]].

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].

The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013108, 123}} While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]],<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013148}} Spacelab,<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|434\u2013435}} and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013140}}  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013224}}   In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013264}} Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet.

The orbiter vehicle maneuvered to an upside down, tail first orientation and began a 2-4 minute OMS burn approximately 20 minutes before it reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40\u00b0 angle-of-attack, and the forward RCS jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was defined as starting at an altitude {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, when it was traveling approximately Mach 25.  The orbiter vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS. The GPCs also controlled the multiple [[aerobraking]] S-turns, using only the roll axis, to dissipate excess speed without changing the angle-of-attack.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u201312}}<ref name=\"atmos\">{{cite web |url= http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html |title=Earth's Atmosphere |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=1995 |author=NASA |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013232332/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/atmosphere.html |archivedate= October 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe orbiter vehicle's aft RCS jets were disabled as it descended and its ailerons, elevators, and rudder became effective in the lower atmosphere.

At 8 minutes 44 seconds prior to landing, the crew deployed the air data probes, and began lowering the angle-of-attack to 36\u00b0.  The orbiter's maximum [[glide ratio]]/[[lift-to-drag ratio]] varied considerably with speed, ranging from 1:1 at [[hypersonic]] speeds, 2:1 at supersonic speeds and reaching 4.5:1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or color, will change to reflect changes in the value of a datum.\n\nTo communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses [[statistical graphics]], [[plot (graphics)|plots]], [[Infographic|information graphics]] and other tools.

The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in [[data analysis]] or [[data science]]. According to Vitaly Friedman (2008) the \"main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose \u2014 to communicate information\".<ref>Vitaly Friedman (2008) [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ \"Data Visualization and Infographics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722172600/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ |date=2008-07-22 }} in: ''Graphics'', Monday Inspiration, January 14th, 2008.</ref>\n\nIndeed, [[Fernanda Viegas]] and [[Martin M.

The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task. As William Cleveland and Robert McGill show, different graphical elements accomplish this more or less effectively. For example, dot plots and bar charts outperform pie charts.\n\nIn his 1983 book ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'', Edward Tufte defines 'graphical displays' and principles for effective graphical display in the following passage:\n\"Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Graphical displays should:\n\n*show the data\n*induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else\n* avoid distorting what the data has to say\n*present many numbers in a small space\n*make large data sets coherent\n*encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n*reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure \n*serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration \n*be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.\nGraphics ''reveal'' data.  Indeed graphics can be more precise and revealing than conventional statistical computations.\"\n\nFor example, the Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812\u20131813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. The line width illustrates a comparison (size of the army at points in time) while the temperature axis suggests a cause of the change in army size. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"\n\nNot applying these principles may result in misleading graphs, which distort the message or support an erroneous conclusion. According to , chartjunk refers to extraneous interior decoration of the graphic that does not enhance the message, or gratuitous three dimensional or perspective effects. Needlessly separating the explanatory key from the image itself, requiring the eye to travel back and forth from the image to the key, is a form of \"administrative debris.\" The ratio of \"data to ink\" should be maximized, erasing non-data ink where feasible.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office summarized several best practices for graphical displays in a June 2014 presentation.  These included: a) Knowing your audience; b) Designing graphics that can stand alone outside the context of the report; and c) Designing graphics that communicate the key messages in the report.\n\n==Quantitative messages==\n[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|upright=1.75|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]\n[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A scatterplot illustrating negative correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]\nAuthor Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message:\n#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.\n#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.\n#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.\n#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.\n#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0-10%, 11-20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. A [[boxplot]] helps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.\n#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.\n#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.\n#[[Geography|Geographic]] or [[geospatial]]: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|title=Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080945/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts reviewing a set of data may consider whether some or all of the messages and graphic types above are applicable to their task and audience. The process of trial and error to identify meaningful relationships and messages in the data is part of [[exploratory data analysis]].\n\n==Visual perception and data visualization==\nA human can distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) readily without significant processing effort; these are referred to as \"[[Pre-attentive processing|pre-attentive attributes]]\".  For example, it may require significant time and effort (\"attentive processing\") to identify the number of times the digit \"5\" appears in a series of numbers; but if that digit is different in size, orientation, or color, instances of the digit can be noted quickly through pre-attentive processing.<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|title=Steven Few-Tapping the Power of Visual Perception-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080935/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEffective graphics take advantage of pre-attentive processing and attributes and the relative strength of these attributes. For example, since humans can more easily process differences in line length than surface area, it may be more effective to use a bar chart (which takes advantage of line length to show comparison) rather than pie charts (which use surface area to show comparison).<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\"/>\n\n=== Human perception/cognition and data visualization ===\nAlmost all data visualizations are created for human consumption.

Earliest documented forms of data visualization were various thematic maps from different cultures and ideograms and hieroglyphs that provided and allowed interpretation of information illustrated. For example, [[Linear B]] tablets of [[Mycenae]] provided a visualization of information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in the Mediterranean. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude at least by 200 BC, and the map projection of a spherical earth into latitude and longitude by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] [c.85\u2013c. 165] in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until the 14th century.<ref name=\"Friendly 2001\"/>\n\nInvention of paper and parchment allowed further development of visualizations throughout history.

The accompanying text refers only to the amplitudes. The curves are apparently not related in time. \n[[File:Mouvement des plan\u00e8tes au cours du temps.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Planetary Movements]]\n\nBy the 16th century, techniques and instruments for precise observation and measurement of physical quantities, and geographic and celestial position were well-developed (for example, a \u201cwall quadrant\u201d constructed by [[Tycho Brahe]] [1546\u20131601], covering an entire wall in his observatory). Particularly important were the development of triangulation and other methods to determine mapping locations accurately.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/>\n\nFrench philosopher and mathematician [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] developed analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat and [[Blaise Pascal]]'s work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/> According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped William [[William Playfair|Playfair]], who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Playfair TimeSeries.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Playfair TimeSeries]] In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jacques Bertin]] used quantitative graphs to represent information \"intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJohn Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians.

The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields?  By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, leveraging design thinking and the latest methods from computing, User-Centered Design, interaction design and 3D graphics.\n\n==Terminology==\nData visualization involves specific terminology, some of which is derived from statistics. For example, author Stephen Few defines two types of data, which are used in combination to support a meaningful analysis or visualization:\n*Categorical: Text labels describing the nature of the data, such as \"Name\" or \"Age\".  This term also covers qualitative (non-numerical) data.\n*Quantitative: Numerical measures, such as \"25\" to represent the age in years.\n\nTwo primary types of [[Information graphics|information displays]] are tables and graphs.\n*A ''table'' contains quantitative data organized into rows and columns with categorical labels. It is primarily used to look up specific values. In the example above, the table might have categorical column labels representing the name (a ''qualitative variable'')  and age (a ''quantitative variable''), with each row of data representing one person (the sampled ''experimental unit'' or ''category subdivision'').\n*A ''graph'' is primarily used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded as ''visual objects'' (e.g., lines, bars, or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one or more ''axes''.  These axes provide ''scales'' (quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to as ''charts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|title=Steven Few-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080924/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEppler and Lengler have developed the \"[http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html Periodic Table of Visualization Methods],\" an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods.

The term was further used and recorded in public usage on December 16, 2009 in a Microsoft Canada presentation on the value of merging Business Intelligence with corporate collaboration processes.}} \"Data Presentation Architecture (DPA) is a rarely applied skill set critical for the success and value of [[Business intelligence|Business Intelligence]]. Data presentation architecture weds the science of numbers, data and statistics in [[information discovery|discovering valuable information]] from data and making it usable, relevant and actionable with the arts of data visualization, communications, [[organizational psychology]] and [[change management]] in order to provide business intelligence solutions with the data scope, delivery timing, format and visualizations that will most effectively support and drive operational, tactical and strategic behaviour toward understood business (or organizational) goals. DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, data presentation architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen. Data visualization skills are one element of DPA.\"\n\n=== Objectives ===\nDPA has two main objectives:\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most efficient manner possible (minimize noise, complexity, and unnecessary data or detail given each audience's needs and roles)\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most effective manner possible  (provide relevant, timely and complete data to each audience member in a clear and understandable manner that conveys important meaning, is actionable and can affect understanding, behavior and decisions)\n\n=== Scope ===\nWith the above objectives in mind, the actual work of data presentation architecture consists of:\n* Creating effective delivery mechanisms for each audience member depending on their role, tasks, locations and access to technology\n* Defining important meaning (relevant knowledge) that is needed by each audience member in each context\n* Determining the required periodicity of data updates (the currency of the data)\n* Determining the right timing for data presentation (when and how often the user needs to see the data)\n* Finding the right data (subject area, historical reach, breadth, level of detail, etc.)\n* Utilizing appropriate analysis, grouping, visualization, and other presentation formats\n\n=== Related fields ===\nDPA work shares commonalities with several other fields, including:\n* [[Business analysis]] in determining business goals, collecting requirements, mapping processes.\n* Business process improvement in that its goal is to improve and streamline actions and decisions in furtherance of business goals\n* Data visualization in that it uses well-established theories of visualization to add or highlight meaning or importance in data presentation.\n* [[Information architecture]], but information architecture's focus is on [[unstructured data]] and therefore excludes both analysis (in the statistical/data sense) and direct transformation of the actual content (data, for DPA) into new entities and combinations.\n* [[Human\u2013computer interaction|HCI]] and [[interaction design]], since the many of the principles in how to design interactive data visualisation have been developed cross-disciplinary with HCI.\n* [[Visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]] or [[data journalism]]: Visual journalism is concerned with all types of graphic facilitation of the telling of news stories, and data-driven and data journalism are not necessarily told with data visualisation. Nevertheless, the field of journalism are at the forefront in developing new data visualisations to communicate data.\n* [[Graphic design]], conveying information through styling, typography, position, and other aesthetic concerns.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Analytics]]\n* [[Balanced scorecard]]\n* [[Big Data]]\n* [[Business analysis]]\n* [[Business intelligence]]\n* [[Climate change art]]\n* [[Data analysis]]\n* [[Data art]]\n* [[Data profiling]]\n* [[Data science]]\n* [[Data warehouse]]\n* [[Exploratory data analysis]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[Information architecture]]\n* [[Information design]]\n* [[Information visualization]]\n* [[Interaction design]]\n* [[Interaction techniques]]\n* [[Scientific visualization]]\n* [[Software visualization]]\n* [[Statistical analysis]]\n* [[Statistical graphics]]\n* [[Visual analytics]]\n* [[Visual journalism]]\n* [[Warming stripes]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!--\nPublications listed here should relate specifically only to data visualization, and not: Computational visualistics, Information graphics, information visualization, Knowledge visualization, Information visualization, and Visual analytics.\n\nThere are some links added here to check the content of every publication.

It involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images. This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or color, will change to reflect changes in the value of a datum.\n\nTo communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses [[statistical graphics]], [[plot (graphics)|plots]], [[Infographic|information graphics]] and other tools.

The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in [[data analysis]] or [[data science]]. According to Vitaly Friedman (2008) the \"main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose \u2014 to communicate information\".<ref>Vitaly Friedman (2008) [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ \"Data Visualization and Infographics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722172600/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ |date=2008-07-22 }} in: ''Graphics'', Monday Inspiration, January 14th, 2008.</ref>\n\nIndeed, [[Fernanda Viegas]] and [[Martin M.

Graphical displays should:\n*show the data\n*induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else\n* avoid distorting what the data has to say\n*present many numbers in a small space\n*make large data sets coherent\n*encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n*reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure \n*serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration \n*be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.\nGraphics ''reveal'' data.

Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. The line width illustrates a comparison (size of the army at points in time) while the temperature axis suggests a cause of the change in army size. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nNot applying these principles may result in [[misleading graphs]], which distort the message or support an erroneous conclusion. According to Tufte, [[chartjunk]] refers to extraneous interior decoration of the graphic that does not enhance the message, or gratuitous three dimensional or perspective effects. Needlessly separating the explanatory key from the image itself, requiring the eye to travel back and forth from the image to the key, is a form of \"administrative debris.\" The ratio of \"data to ink\" should be maximized, erasing non-data ink where feasible.<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] summarized several best practices for graphical displays in a June 2014 presentation.  These included: a) Knowing your audience; b) Designing graphics that can stand alone outside the context of the report; and c) Designing graphics that communicate the key messages in the report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|title=Telling Visual Stories About Data - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204135630/https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|archive-date=2014-12-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Quantitative messages==\n[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|upright=1.75|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]\n[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A scatterplot illustrating negative correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]\nAuthor Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message:\n#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.\n#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.\n#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.\n#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.\n#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0-10%, 11-20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. A [[boxplot]] helps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.\n#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.\n#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.\n#[[Geography|Geographic]] or [[geospatial]]: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|title=Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080945/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts reviewing a set of data may consider whether some or all of the messages and graphic types above are applicable to their task and audience. The process of trial and error to identify meaningful relationships and messages in the data is part of [[exploratory data analysis]].\n\n==Visual perception and data visualization==\nA human can distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) readily without significant processing effort; these are referred to as \"[[Pre-attentive processing|pre-attentive attributes]]\".  For example, it may require significant time and effort (\"attentive processing\") to identify the number of times the digit \"5\" appears in a series of numbers; but if that digit is different in size, orientation, or color, instances of the digit can be noted quickly through pre-attentive processing.<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|title=Steven Few-Tapping the Power of Visual Perception-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080935/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEffective graphics take advantage of pre-attentive processing and attributes and the relative strength of these attributes.

For example, [[Linear B]] tablets of [[Mycenae]] provided a visualization of information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in the Mediterranean. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude at least by 200 BC, and the map projection of a spherical earth into latitude and longitude by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] [c.85\u2013c. 165] in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until the 14th century.<ref name=\"Friendly 2001\"/>\n\nInvention of paper and parchment allowed further development of visualizations throughout history.

Particularly important were the development of triangulation and other methods to determine mapping locations accurately.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/>\n\nFrench philosopher and mathematician [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] developed analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat and [[Blaise Pascal]]'s work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/> According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped William [[William Playfair|Playfair]], who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Playfair TimeSeries.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Playfair TimeSeries]] In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jacques Bertin]] used quantitative graphs to represent information \"intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJohn Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians. With the progression of technology came the progression of data visualization; starting with hand drawn visualizations and evolving into more technical applications \u2013 including interactive designs leading to software visualization.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|title = A Brief History of Data Visualization|date = 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-22|website = York University|publisher = Springer-Verlag|last = Friendly|first = Michael|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160508232649/http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|archive-date = 2016-05-08|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nPrograms like [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SOFA Statistics|SOFA]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Minitab]], Cornerstone and more allow for data visualization in the field of statistics.

The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields?  By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, leveraging design thinking and the latest methods from computing, User-Centered Design, interaction design and 3D graphics.\n\n==Terminology==\nData visualization involves specific terminology, some of which is derived from statistics. For example, author Stephen Few defines two types of data, which are used in combination to support a meaningful analysis or visualization:\n*Categorical: Text labels describing the nature of the data, such as \"Name\" or \"Age\".  This term also covers qualitative (non-numerical) data.\n*Quantitative: Numerical measures, such as \"25\" to represent the age in years.\n\nTwo primary types of [[Information graphics|information displays]] are tables and graphs.\n*A ''table'' contains quantitative data organized into rows and columns with categorical labels. It is primarily used to look up specific values. In the example above, the table might have categorical column labels representing the name (a ''qualitative variable'')  and age (a ''quantitative variable''), with each row of data representing one person (the sampled ''experimental unit'' or ''category subdivision'').\n*A ''graph'' is primarily used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded as ''visual objects'' (e.g., lines, bars, or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one or more ''axes''.  These axes provide ''scales'' (quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to as ''charts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|title=Steven Few-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080924/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEppler and Lengler have developed the \"[http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html Periodic Table of Visualization Methods],\" an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods.

The term was further used and recorded in public usage on December 16, 2009 in a Microsoft Canada presentation on the value of merging Business Intelligence with corporate collaboration processes.}} \"Data Presentation Architecture (DPA) is a rarely applied skill set critical for the success and value of [[Business intelligence|Business Intelligence]]. Data presentation architecture weds the science of numbers, data and statistics in [[information discovery|discovering valuable information]] from data and making it usable, relevant and actionable with the arts of data visualization, communications, [[organizational psychology]] and [[change management]] in order to provide business intelligence solutions with the data scope, delivery timing, format and visualizations that will most effectively support and drive operational, tactical and strategic behaviour toward understood business (or organizational) goals. DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, data presentation architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen. Data visualization skills are one element of DPA.\"\n\n=== Objectives ===\nDPA has two main objectives:\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most efficient manner possible (minimize noise, complexity, and unnecessary data or detail given each audience's needs and roles)\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most effective manner possible  (provide relevant, timely and complete data to each audience member in a clear and understandable manner that conveys important meaning, is actionable and can affect understanding, behavior and decisions)\n\n=== Scope ===\nWith the above objectives in mind, the actual work of data presentation architecture consists of:\n* Creating effective delivery mechanisms for each audience member depending on their role, tasks, locations and access to technology\n* Defining important meaning (relevant knowledge) that is needed by each audience member in each context\n* Determining the required periodicity of data updates (the currency of the data)\n* Determining the right timing for data presentation (when and how often the user needs to see the data)\n* Finding the right data (subject area, historical reach, breadth, level of detail, etc.)\n* Utilizing appropriate analysis, grouping, visualization, and other presentation formats\n\n=== Related fields ===\nDPA work shares commonalities with several other fields, including:\n* [[Business analysis]] in determining business goals, collecting requirements, mapping processes.\n* Business process improvement in that its goal is to improve and streamline actions and decisions in furtherance of business goals\n* Data visualization in that it uses well-established theories of visualization to add or highlight meaning or importance in data presentation.\n* [[Information architecture]], but information architecture's focus is on [[unstructured data]] and therefore excludes both analysis (in the statistical/data sense) and direct transformation of the actual content (data, for DPA) into new entities and combinations.\n* [[Human\u2013computer interaction|HCI]] and [[interaction design]], since the many of the principles in how to design interactive data visualisation have been developed cross-disciplinary with HCI.\n* [[Visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]] or [[data journalism]]: Visual journalism is concerned with all types of graphic facilitation of the telling of news stories, and data-driven and data journalism are not necessarily told with data visualisation.

A galvanometer works as an [[actuator]], by producing a rotary deflection (of a \"pointer\"), in response to electric current flowing through a [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] in a constant [[magnetic field]]. Early galvanometers were not calibrated, but their later developments were used as measuring instruments, called [[ammeter]]s, to measure the current flowing through an electric circuit.\n\nGalvanometers developed from the observation that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] is deflected near a wire that has electric current flowing through it, first described by [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] in 1820. They were the first instruments used to detect and measure small amounts of electric currents.

For example, in the 1800s they enabled long range communication through submarine cables, such as the earliest [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s, and were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|heart]] and [[Brain#Electrical activity|brain]], by their fine measurements of current.\n\nGalvanometers also had widespread use as the visualising part in other kinds of analog meters, for example in [[light meter]]s, [[VU meter]]s, etc., where they were used to measure and display the output of other [[sensor]]s. Today the main type of galvanometer mechanism, still in use, is the moving coil, [[D'Arsonval galvanometer|D'Arsonval/Weston]] type.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Galvanometer scheme.svg|thumb|right|320px|alt=Diagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type galvanometer.| Diagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type galvanometer. As the current flows from '''+''' through the coil (the orange part) to '''\u2212''', a magnetic field is generated in the coil. This field is counteracted by the permanent magnet and forces the coil to twist, moving the pointer, in relation to the field's strength caused by the flow of current.]]\nModern galvanometers, of the D'Arsonval/Weston type, are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire, called a spindle, in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\n\nWhen a [[direct current]] (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angular deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without [[oscillation]].\n\nThe basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100 [[Ampere|microamperes]] full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called [[shunt (electrical)|shunts]], allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a [[resistor]] in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.\n\nThese capabilities to translate different kinds of electric quantities, in to pointer movements, make the galvanometer ideal for turning output of other sensors that outputs electricity (in some form or another), into something that can be read by a human.\n\nBecause the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter, [[parallax]] error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that \"lines up\" with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by positioning one's head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any [[parallax]] error has been minimized.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:DynAXIS L.jpg|thumb|Closed-loop galvanometer-driven laser scanning mirror]]\nProbably the largest use of galvanometers was of the D'Arsonval/Weston type used in analog meters in electronic equipment. Since the 1980s, galvanometer-type analog meter movements have been displaced by [[analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs) for many uses. A digital panel meter (DPM) contains an analog to digital converter and numeric display. The advantages of a digital instrument are higher precision and accuracy, but factors such as power consumption or cost may still favour application of analog meter movements.\n\n===Modern uses===\nMost modern uses for the galvanometer mechanism are in positioning and control systems. \nGalvanometer mechanisms are divided into moving magnet and moving coil galvanometers; in addition, they are divided into ''closed-loop'' and ''open-loop'' - or ''resonant'' - types.\n\n''Mirror'' galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning or beam steering elements in [[laser scanning|laser scanning systems]]. For example, for material processing with high-power lasers, closed loop mirror galvanometer mechanisms are used with [[Servomechanism|servo]] control systems. These are typically high power galvanometers and the newest galvanometers designed for beam steering applications can have frequency responses over 10&nbsp;kHz with appropriate servo technology. Closed-loop mirror galvanometers are also used in similar ways in [[stereolithography]], [[Direct metal laser sintering|laser sintering]], [[laser engraving]], [[laser beam welding]], [[laser TV]]s, [[laser display]]s and in imaging applications such as retinal scanning with [[Optical coherence tomography|Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT). Almost all of these galvanometers are of the moving magnet type. The closed loop is obtained measuring the position of the rotating axis with an infrared emitter and 2 photodiodes. This feedback is an analog signal.\n\nOpen loop, or resonant mirror galvanometers, are mainly used in some types of laser-based bar-code scanners, printing machines, imaging applications, military applications and space systems. Their non-lubricated bearings are especially of interest in applications that require functioning in a high [[vacuum]].\n[[File:Autoexpmeter.JPG|thumb|320px|right|A galvanometer mechanism (center part), used in an automatic exposure unit of an [[8 mm film]] [[movie camera|camera]], together with a [[photoresistor]] (seen in the hole on top of the leftpart).]]\nMoving coil type galvanometer mechanisms (called 'voice coils' by hard disk manufacturers) are used for controlling the ''head positioning'' servos in [[hard disk drive]]s and CD/DVD players, in order to keep mass (and thus access times), as low as possible.\n\n===Past uses===\nA major early use for galvanometers was for finding faults in telecommunications cables. They were superseded in this application late in the 20th century by [[time-domain reflectometer]]s.\n\nGalvanometer mechanisms were also used to get readings from [[photoresistors]] in the metering mechanisms of film cameras (as seen in the adjacent image).\n\nIn analog strip [[chart recorder]]s such as used in [[electrocardiograph]]s, [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]]s and [[polygraph]]s, galvanometer mechanisms were used to position the ''pen''. Strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens may have a full scale frequency response of 100&nbsp;Hz and several centimeters of deflection.\n\n==History==\n===Hans Oersted===\nThe deflection of a [[magnetic compass]] needle by current in a wire was first described by [[Hans Oersted]] in 1820. The phenomenon was studied both for its own sake and as a means of measuring electric current.\n\n===Schweigger and Amp\u00e8re===\nThe earliest galvanometer was reported by [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger|Johann Schweigger]] at the [[University of Halle]] on 16 September 1820. [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] also contributed to its development. Early designs increased the effect of the magnetic field generated by the current by using multiple turns of wire. The instruments were at first called \"multipliers\" due to this common design feature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|website=Maglab|publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> The term \"galvanometer,\" in common use by 1836, was derived from the surname of Italian electricity researcher [[Luigi Galvani]], who in 1791 discovered that electric current would make a [[frog galvanoscope|dead frog's leg jerk]].\n\n===Poggendorff and Thomson===\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|320px|Thomson mirror galvanometer, patented in 1858.]]\n\nOriginally, the instruments relied on the Earth's magnetic field to provide the restoring force for the compass needle. These were called [[#Tangent galvanometer|\"tangent\" galvanometer]]s and had to be oriented before use. Later instruments of the \"[[#Astatic galvanometer|astatic]]\" type used opposing magnets to become independent of the Earth's field and would operate in any orientation.\n\n====Mirror galvanometer====\n{{main|Mirror galvanometer}}\nAn early mirror galvanometer was invented in 1826 by [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} The most sensitive form of astatic galvanometer, the Thomson galvanometer, for which Thomson coined the term ''mirror galvanometer'', was patented in 1858 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin).  Thomson's mirror galvanometer was an improvement of a design invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1849.<ref>Lindley, David, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', pp. 132\u2013133, Joseph Henry Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0309167825}}</ref> Thomson's design was able to detect very rapid current changes by using small magnets attached to a lightweight mirror, suspended by a thread, instead of a compass needle. The deflection of a light beam on the mirror greatly magnified the deflection induced by small currents. Alternatively, the deflection of the suspended magnets could be observed directly through a microscope.\n\n===Georg Ohm===\nThe ability to measure quantitatively voltage and current allowed [[Georg Ohm]], in 1827, to formulate [[Ohm's Law]] \u2013 that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current through it.\n\n===D'Arsonval and Deprez===\nThe early moving-magnet form of galvanometer had the disadvantage that it was affected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not linearly proportional to the current. In 1882 [[Jacques-Ars\u00e8ne d'Arsonval]] and [[Marcel Deprez]] developed [[D'Arsonval galvanometer|a form]] with a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by fine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the restoring torque to return to the zero position. An iron tube between the magnet's pole pieces defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated. This gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving a linear response throughout the instrument's range. A mirror attached to the coil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position. The concentrated magnetic field and delicate suspension made these instruments sensitive; d'Arsonval's initial instrument could detect ten [[Ampere|microamperes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keithley |first=Joseph F. |year=1999 |title=The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-7803-1193-0 |pages=196\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Edward Weston===\n[[File:D'Arsonval ammeter movement.jpg|thumb|320px|D'Arsonval/Weston galvanometer (ca. 1900). Part of the magnet's left [[pole piece]] is broken out to show the coil.]]\n[[File:Weston galvanometer 6h440s49d 4j03cz922 dl full size.jpg|thumb|right|Weston galvanometer in portable case]]\n[[Edward Weston (chemist)|Edward Weston]] extensively improved the design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a pivot, and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather like those of a wristwatch [[balance wheel]] hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated [[parallax]] observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a \"portable\" instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today.\n\nInitially laboratory instruments relying on the Earth's own magnetic field to provide restoring force for the pointer, galvanometers were developed into compact, rugged, sensitive portable instruments essential to the development of electro-technology.\n\n===Taut-band movement===\nThe taut-band movement is a modern development of the D'Arsonval-Weston movement.  The jewel pivots and hairsprings are replaced by tiny strips of metal under tension. Such a meter is more rugged for field use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weschler.com/blog/the-taut-band-analog-meter/|title=The taut-band analog meter|date=20 February 2020|last=Weschler Instruments|accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref><ref>http://www.dictionarycentral.com/definition/taut-band-meter.html</ref>\n\n==Types==\nSome galvanometers use a solid pointer on a scale to show measurements; other very sensitive types use a miniature mirror and a beam of light to provide mechanical amplification of low-level signals.\n\n===Tangent galvanometer===\nA tangent galvanometer is an early [[measuring instrument]] used for the measurement of [[electric current]]. It works by using a [[compass]] needle to compare a [[magnetic field]] generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the [[tangent]] of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by [[Johan Jacob Nervander]] in 1834 (see  J.J. Nervander, \u201cM\u00e9moire sur un Galvanom\u00e8tre \u00e0 ch\u00e2ssis \ncylindrique par lequel on obtient imm\u00e9diatement et sans calcul la mesure de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 du courant \u00e9lectrique qui produit la d\u00e9viation de l\u2019aiguille aimant\u00e9e,\u201d Annales de Chimie et de Physique (Paris), Tome 55, 156\u2013184, 1834. and J.

The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax, a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.\n\nIn operation, the instrument is first rotated until the magnetic field of the Earth, indicated by the compass needle, is parallel with the plane of the coil. Then the unknown current is applied to the coil. This creates a second magnetic field on the axis of the coil, perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle responds to the [[vector sum]] of the two fields, and deflects to an angle equal to the tangent of the ratio of the two fields. From the angle read from the compass's scale, the current could be found from a table.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tangent Galvanometer |last=Greenslade, Jr. |first=Thomas B. |publisher=Kenyon College |url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electrical_Measurements/Tangent_Galvanometer/Tangent_Galvanometer.html |accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref> The current supply wires have to be wound in a small helix, like a pig's tail, otherwise the field due to the wire will affect the compass needle and an incorrect reading will be obtained.\n<gallery caption=\"Tangent Galvanometer\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%;\">\nFile:Sine and Tangent Galvanometer-MHS 98-IMG 3874-gradient.jpg|An 1850 [[Claude Pouillet|Pouillet]] Tangent Galvanometer on display at [[Mus\u00e9e d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve]]\nFile:Western Union standard galvanometer.jpg|alt=Drawing.

The indicator needle of the compass is perpendicular to the shorter, black magnetic needle.\n</gallery>\n\n====Theory====\nThe galvanometer is oriented so that the plane of the coil is vertical and aligned along parallel to the horizontal component {{math|''B<sub>H</sub>''}} of the Earth's magnetic field (i.e. parallel to the local \"magnetic meridian\"). When an electric current flows through the galvanometer coil, a second magnetic field {{math|''B''}} is created. At the center of the coil, where the compass needle is located, the coil's field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The magnitude of the coil's field is:\n:<math>B={\\mu_0 nI\\over 2r}\\,</math>\nwhere {{math|''I''}} is the current in [[ampere (unit)|ampere]]s, {{math|''n''}} is the number of turns of the coil and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the coil. These two perpendicular magnetic fields add [[Parallelogram of force|vectorially]], and the compass needle points along the direction of their resultant {{math|''B<sub>H</sub>+B''}}. The current in the coil causes the compass needle to rotate by an angle {{math|''\u03b8''}}:\n:<math>\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\frac{B}{B_H}\\,</math>\nFrom tangent law, {{math|''B {{=}} B<sub>H </sub>''tan'' \u03b8''}}, i.e.\n:<math>{\\mu_0 nI\\over 2r} = B_H \\tan\\theta\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>I=\\left(\\frac{2rB_H}{\\mu_0 n}\\right)\\tan\\theta\\,</math>\nor {{math|''I {{=}} K ''tan'' \u03b8''}}, where {{math|''K''}} is called the Reduction Factor of the tangent galvanometer.\n\nOne problem with the tangent galvanometer is that its resolution degrades at both high currents and low currents.  The maximum resolution is obtained when the value of {{math|''\u03b8''}} is 45\u00b0. When the value of {{math|''\u03b8''}} is close to 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0, a large percentage change in the current will only move the needle a few degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prugalvanometer.weebly.com/theory.html|title=Theory|website=GALVANOMETER|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n====Geomagnetic field measurement====\nA tangent galvanometer can also be used to measure the magnitude of the horizontal component of the [[geomagnetic field]]. When used in this way, a low-voltage power source, such as a battery, is connected in series with a [[rheostat]], the galvanometer, and an [[ammeter]]. The galvanometer is first aligned so that the coil is parallel to the geomagnetic field, whose direction is indicated by the compass when there is no current through the coils. The battery is then connected and the rheostat is adjusted until the compass needle deflects 45 degrees from the geomagnetic field, indicating that the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is the same as that of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. This field strength can be calculated from the current as measured by the ammeter, the number of turns of the coil, and the radius of the coils.\n\n===Astatic galvanometer===\nUnlike the tangent galvanometer, the ''astatic galvanometer'' does not use the Earth's magnetic field for measurement, so it does not need to be oriented with respect to the Earth's field, making it easier to use. Developed by [[Leopoldo Nobili]] in 1825,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nobili|first1=Leopoldo|title=Sur un nouveau galvanom\u00e8tre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences|journal=Biblioth\u00e8que universelle|date=1825|volume=29|pages=119\u2013125|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052859663;view=1up;seq=125|trans-title=On a new galvanometer presented at the Academy of Sciences|language=French}}</ref> it consists of two magnetized needles parallel to each other but with the magnetic poles reversed.

The purpose of the second needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the suspended armature has no net [[magnetic dipole moment]], and thus is not affected by the earth's magnetic field.  The needle's rotation is opposed by the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to the angle.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Nobili's astatic galvanometer\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%;\">\nFile:Galvanometer-MHS 229-IMG 3875-gradient.jpg|Galvanometer on display at [[Mus\u00e9e d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve]]\nFile:Astatic Galvanometer brass and ivory.jpg|Detail of an astatic galvanometer.\n</gallery>\n\n===Mirror galvanometer===\n{{main article|mirror galvanometer}}\nTo achieve higher sensitivity to detect extremely small currents, the [[mirror galvanometer]] substitutes a lightweight mirror for the pointer.  It consists of horizontal magnets suspended from a fine fiber, inside a vertical coil of wire, with a mirror attached to the magnets.  A beam of light reflected from the mirror falls on a graduated scale across the room, acting as a long mass-less pointer. The mirror galvanometer was used as the receiver in the first trans-Atlantic [[submarine communications cable|submarine telegraph cables]] in the 1850s, to detect the extremely faint pulses of current after their thousand-mile journey under the Atlantic. In a device called an [[oscillograph]], the moving beam of light is used, to produce graphs of current versus time, by recording measurements on photographic film. The [[string galvanometer]] is a type of mirror galvanometer so sensitive that it was used to make the first [[electrocardiogram]] of the electrical activity of the human heart.\n\n===Ballistic galvanometer===\n{{main article|Ballistic galvanometer}}\nA ballistic galvanometer is a type of sensitive galvanometer for measuring the quantity of [[Electric charge|charge]] discharged through it. In reality it is an [[integrator]], unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large [[moment of inertia]] that gives it a long [[oscillation]] period. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type; commonly it is a [[mirror galvanometer]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vibration galvanometer]]\n* [[Thermo galvanometer]]\n* [[String galvanometer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Galvanometers}}\n* [https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/galvanometer Galvanometer - Interactive Java Tutorial] National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n* [http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/technology/search?-max=10&-title=1&-op_varioid=numerical&varioid=7 Selection of historic galvanometer] in the [[Virtual Laboratory]] of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]\n\n{{Electrical and electronic measuring equipment}}\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Galvanometers]]\n[[Category:Electrical instruments]]\n[[Category:Historical scientific instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Instrument to measure electric current}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n[[File:A moving coil galvanometer. Wellcome M0016397.jpg|thumb|320px|An early D'Arsonval galvanometer showing magnet and rotating coil]]\nA '''galvanometer''' is an [[electromechanical]] instrument used for detecting and indicating an [[electric current]]. A galvanometer works as an [[actuator]], by producing a rotary deflection (of a \"pointer\"), in response to electric current flowing through a [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] in a constant [[magnetic field]]. Early galvanometers were not calibrated, but their later developments were used as measuring instruments, called [[ammeter]]s, to measure the current flowing through an electric circuit.\n\nGalvanometers developed from the observation that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] is deflected near a wire that has electric current flowing through it, first described by [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] in 1820. They were the first instruments used to detect and measure small amounts of electric currents. [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]], who gave mathematical expression to \u00d8rsted's discovery and named the instrument after<ref>Schiffer, Michael Brian. (2008)\"Electromagnetism Revealed,\" Power Struggles: Scientific Authority and the Creation of Practical Electricity Before Edison. Page 24.</ref> the Italian electricity researcher [[Luigi Galvani]], who in 1791 discovered the principle of the [[frog galvanoscope]] \u2013 that electric current would make the legs of a dead frog jerk.\n\nSensitive galvanometers have been essential for the development of science and technology in many fields. For example, in the 1800s they enabled long range communication through submarine cables, such as the earliest [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s, and were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|heart]] and [[Brain#Electrical activity|brain]], by their fine measurements of current.\n\nGalvanometers also had widespread use as the visualising part in other kinds of analog meters, for example in [[light meter]]s, [[VU meter]]s, etc., where they were used to measure and display the output of other [[sensor]]s. Today the main type of galvanometer mechanism, still in use, is the moving coil, [[D'Arsonval galvanometer|D'Arsonval/Weston]] type.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Galvanometer scheme.svg|thumb|right|320px|alt=Diagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type galvanometer.| Diagram of D'Arsonval/Weston type galvanometer. As the current flows from '''+''' through the coil (the orange part) to '''\u2212''', a magnetic field is generated in the coil. This field is counteracted by the permanent magnet and forces the coil to twist, moving the pointer, in relation to the field's strength caused by the flow of current.]]\nModern galvanometers, of the D'Arsonval/Weston type, are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire, called a spindle, in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\n\nWhen a [[direct current]] (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angular deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without [[oscillation]].\n\nThe basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100 [[Ampere|microamperes]] full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called [[shunt (electrical)|shunts]], allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a [[resistor]] in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.\n\nThese capabilities to translate different kinds of electric quantities, in to pointer movements, make the galvanometer ideal for turning output of other sensors that outputs electricity (in some form or another), into something that can be read by a human.\n\nBecause the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter, [[parallax]] error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that \"lines up\" with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by positioning one's head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any [[parallax]] error has been minimized.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:DynAXIS L.jpg|thumb|Closed-loop galvanometer-driven laser scanning mirror]]\nProbably the largest use of galvanometers was of the D'Arsonval/Weston type used in analog meters in electronic equipment. Since the 1980s, galvanometer-type analog meter movements have been displaced by [[analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs) for many uses. A digital panel meter (DPM) contains an analog to digital converter and numeric display. The advantages of a digital instrument are higher precision and accuracy, but factors such as power consumption or cost may still favour application of analog meter movements.\n\n===Modern uses===\nMost modern uses for the galvanometer mechanism are in positioning and control systems. \nGalvanometer mechanisms are divided into moving magnet and moving coil galvanometers; in addition, they are divided into ''closed-loop'' and ''open-loop'' - or ''resonant'' - types.\n\n''Mirror'' galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning or beam steering elements in [[laser scanning|laser scanning systems]]. For example, for material processing with high-power lasers, closed loop mirror galvanometer mechanisms are used with [[Servomechanism|servo]] control systems. These are typically high power galvanometers and the newest galvanometers designed for beam steering applications can have frequency responses over 10&nbsp;kHz with appropriate servo technology. Closed-loop mirror galvanometers are also used in similar ways in [[stereolithography]], [[Direct metal laser sintering|laser sintering]], [[laser engraving]], [[laser beam welding]], [[laser TV]]s, [[laser display]]s and in imaging applications such as retinal scanning with [[Optical coherence tomography|Optical Coherence Tomography]] (OCT). Almost all of these galvanometers are of the moving magnet type. The closed loop is obtained measuring the position of the rotating axis with an infrared emitter and 2 photodiodes. This feedback is an analog signal.\n\nOpen loop, or resonant mirror galvanometers, are mainly used in some types of laser-based bar-code scanners, printing machines, imaging applications, military applications and space systems. Their non-lubricated bearings are especially of interest in applications that require functioning in a high [[vacuum]].\n[[File:Autoexpmeter.JPG|thumb|320px|right|A galvanometer mechanism (center part), used in an automatic exposure unit of an [[8 mm film]] [[movie camera|camera]], together with a [[photoresistor]] (seen in the hole on top of the leftpart).]]\nMoving coil type galvanometer mechanisms (called 'voice coils' by hard disk manufacturers) are used for controlling the ''head positioning'' servos in [[hard disk drive]]s and CD/DVD players, in order to keep mass (and thus access times), as low as possible.\n\n===Past uses===\nA major early use for galvanometers was for finding faults in telecommunications cables. They were superseded in this application late in the 20th century by [[time-domain reflectometer]]s.\n\nGalvanometer mechanisms were also used to get readings from [[photoresistors]] in the metering mechanisms of film cameras (as seen in the adjacent image).\n\nIn analog strip [[chart recorder]]s such as used in [[electrocardiograph]]s, [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]]s and [[polygraph]]s, galvanometer mechanisms were used to position the ''pen''. Strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens may have a full scale frequency response of 100&nbsp;Hz and several centimeters of deflection.\n\n==History==\n===Hans Oersted===\nThe deflection of a [[magnetic compass]] needle by current in a wire was first described by [[Hans Oersted]] in 1820. The phenomenon was studied both for its own sake and as a means of measuring electric current.\n\n===Schweigger and Amp\u00e8re===\nThe earliest galvanometer was reported by [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger|Johann Schweigger]] at the [[University of Halle]] on 16 September 1820. [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] also contributed to its development. Early designs increased the effect of the magnetic field generated by the current by using multiple turns of wire. The instruments were at first called \"multipliers\" due to this common design feature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|website=Maglab|publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> The term \"galvanometer,\" in common use by 1836, was derived from the surname of Italian electricity researcher [[Luigi Galvani]], who in 1791 discovered that electric current would make a [[frog galvanoscope|dead frog's leg jerk]].\n\n===Poggendorff and Thomson===\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|320px|Thomson mirror galvanometer, patented in 1858.]]\n\nOriginally, the instruments relied on the Earth's magnetic field to provide the restoring force for the compass needle. These were called [[#Tangent galvanometer|\"tangent\" galvanometer]]s and had to be oriented before use. Later instruments of the \"[[#Astatic galvanometer|astatic]]\" type used opposing magnets to become independent of the Earth's field and would operate in any orientation.\n\n====Mirror galvanometer====\n{{main|Mirror galvanometer}}\nAn early mirror galvanometer was invented in 1826 by [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} The most sensitive form of astatic galvanometer, the Thomson galvanometer, for which Thomson coined the term ''mirror galvanometer'', was patented in 1858 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin).  Thomson's mirror galvanometer was an improvement of a design invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1849.<ref>Lindley, David, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', pp. 132\u2013133, Joseph Henry Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0309167825}}</ref> Thomson's design was able to detect very rapid current changes by using small magnets attached to a lightweight mirror, suspended by a thread, instead of a compass needle. The deflection of a light beam on the mirror greatly magnified the deflection induced by small currents. Alternatively, the deflection of the suspended magnets could be observed directly through a microscope.\n\n===Georg Ohm===\nThe ability to measure quantitatively voltage and current allowed [[Georg Ohm]], in 1827, to formulate [[Ohm's Law]] \u2013 that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current through it.\n\n===D'Arsonval and Deprez===\nThe early moving-magnet form of galvanometer had the disadvantage that it was affected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not linearly proportional to the current. In 1882 [[Jacques-Ars\u00e8ne d'Arsonval]] and [[Marcel Deprez]] developed [[D'Arsonval galvanometer|a form]] with a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by fine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the restoring torque to return to the zero position. An iron tube between the magnet's pole pieces defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated. This gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving a linear response throughout the instrument's range. A mirror attached to the coil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position. The concentrated magnetic field and delicate suspension made these instruments sensitive; d'Arsonval's initial instrument could detect ten [[Ampere|microamperes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keithley |first=Joseph F. |year=1999 |title=The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-7803-1193-0 |pages=196\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Edward Weston===\n[[File:D'Arsonval ammeter movement.jpg|thumb|320px|D'Arsonval/Weston galvanometer (ca. 1900). Part of the magnet's left [[pole piece]] is broken out to show the coil.]]\n[[File:Weston galvanometer 6h440s49d 4j03cz922 dl full size.jpg|thumb|right|Weston galvanometer in portable case]]\n[[Edward Weston (chemist)|Edward Weston]] extensively improved the design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a pivot, and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather like those of a wristwatch [[balance wheel]] hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated [[parallax]] observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a \"portable\" instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today.\n\nInitially laboratory instruments relying on the Earth's own magnetic field to provide restoring force for the pointer, galvanometers were developed into compact, rugged, sensitive portable instruments essential to the development of electro-technology.\n\n===Taut-band movement===\nThe taut-band movement is a modern development of the D'Arsonval-Weston movement.  The jewel pivots and hairsprings are replaced by tiny strips of metal under tension. Such a meter is more rugged for field use.<ref>http://www.dictionarycentral.com/definition/taut-band-meter.html</ref>\n\n==Types==\nSome galvanometers use a solid pointer on a scale to show measurements; other very sensitive types use a miniature mirror and a beam of light to provide mechanical amplification of low-level signals.\n\n===Tangent galvanometer===\nA tangent galvanometer is an early [[measuring instrument]] used for the measurement of [[electric current]]. It works by using a [[compass]] needle to compare a [[magnetic field]] generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the [[tangent]] of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by [[Johan Jacob Nervander]] in 1834 (see  J.J. Nervander, \u201cM\u00e9moire sur un Galvanom\u00e8tre \u00e0 ch\u00e2ssis \ncylindrique par lequel on obtient imm\u00e9diatement et sans calcul la mesure de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 du courant \u00e9lectrique qui produit la d\u00e9viation de l\u2019aiguille aimant\u00e9e,\u201d Annales de Chimie et de Physique (Paris), Tome 55, 156\u2013184, 1834. and J. Venermo and A. Sihvola, \"The tangent galvanometer of Johan Jacob Nervander,\" IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement\nMagazine, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 16-23, June 2008.) and in 1837 by [[Claude Pouillet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pouillet|title=M\u00e9moire sur la pile de Volta et sur la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'intensit\u00e9 que prennent les courrants, soit qu'ils proviennent d'un seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment, soit qu'ils proviennent d'une pile \u00e0 grande ou \u00e0 petite tension|journal=Comptes rendus|date=1837|volume=4|pages=267\u2013279|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/112006#page/273/mode/1up|trans-title=Memoir on the Voltaic pile [i.e., battery] and on the general law of the intensity that currents assume, whether they come from a single element or they come from a pile of high or low voltage|language=French}}</ref>\n\nA tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax, a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.\n\nIn operation, the instrument is first rotated until the magnetic field of the Earth, indicated by the compass needle, is parallel with the plane of the coil. Then the unknown current is applied to the coil. This creates a second magnetic field on the axis of the coil, perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle responds to the [[vector sum]] of the two fields, and deflects to an angle equal to the tangent of the ratio of the two fields. From the angle read from the compass's scale, the current could be found from a table.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tangent Galvanometer |last=Greenslade, Jr. |first=Thomas B. |publisher=Kenyon College |url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electrical_Measurements/Tangent_Galvanometer/Tangent_Galvanometer.html |accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref> The current supply wires have to be wound in a small helix, like a pig's tail, otherwise the field due to the wire will affect the compass needle and an incorrect reading will be obtained.\n<gallery caption=\"Tangent Galvanometer\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%;\">\nFile:Sine and Tangent Galvanometer-MHS 98-IMG 3874-gradient.jpg|An 1850 [[Claude Pouillet|Pouillet]] Tangent Galvanometer on display at [[Mus\u00e9e d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve]]\nFile:Western Union standard galvanometer.jpg|alt=Drawing.

The compass and ring are supported on a brass tripod that has leveling screws as its feet.|Top view of a tangent galvanometer made about 1950. The indicator needle of the compass is perpendicular to the shorter, black magnetic needle.\n</gallery>\n\n====Theory====\nThe galvanometer is oriented so that the plane of the coil is vertical and aligned along parallel to the horizontal component {{math|''B<sub>H</sub>''}} of the Earth's magnetic field (i.e. parallel to the local \"magnetic meridian\"). When an electric current flows through the galvanometer coil, a second magnetic field {{math|''B''}} is created. At the center of the coil, where the compass needle is located, the coil's field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The magnitude of the coil's field is:\n:<math>B={\\mu_0 nI\\over 2r}\\,</math>\nwhere {{math|''I''}} is the current in [[ampere (unit)|ampere]]s, {{math|''n''}} is the number of turns of the coil and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the coil. These two perpendicular magnetic fields add [[Parallelogram of force|vectorially]], and the compass needle points along the direction of their resultant {{math|''B<sub>H</sub>+B''}}. The current in the coil causes the compass needle to rotate by an angle {{math|''\u03b8''}}:\n:<math>\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\frac{B}{B_H}\\,</math>\nFrom tangent law, {{math|''B {{=}} B<sub>H </sub>''tan'' \u03b8''}}, i.e.\n:<math>{\\mu_0 nI\\over 2r} = B_H \\tan\\theta\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>I=\\left(\\frac{2rB_H}{\\mu_0 n}\\right)\\tan\\theta\\,</math>\nor {{math|''I {{=}} K ''tan'' \u03b8''}}, where {{math|''K''}} is called the Reduction Factor of the tangent galvanometer.\n\nOne problem with the tangent galvanometer is that its resolution degrades at both high currents and low currents.  The maximum resolution is obtained when the value of {{math|''\u03b8''}} is 45\u00b0. When the value of {{math|''\u03b8''}} is close to 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0, a large percentage change in the current will only move the needle a few degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prugalvanometer.weebly.com/theory.html|title=Theory|website=GALVANOMETER|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n====Geomagnetic field measurement====\nA tangent galvanometer can also be used to measure the magnitude of the horizontal component of the [[geomagnetic field]]. When used in this way, a low-voltage power source, such as a battery, is connected in series with a [[rheostat]], the galvanometer, and an [[ammeter]]. The galvanometer is first aligned so that the coil is parallel to the geomagnetic field, whose direction is indicated by the compass when there is no current through the coils. The battery is then connected and the rheostat is adjusted until the compass needle deflects 45 degrees from the geomagnetic field, indicating that the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is the same as that of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. This field strength can be calculated from the current as measured by the ammeter, the number of turns of the coil, and the radius of the coils.\n\n===Astatic galvanometer===\nUnlike the tangent galvanometer, the ''astatic galvanometer'' does not use the Earth's magnetic field for measurement, so it does not need to be oriented with respect to the Earth's field, making it easier to use. Developed by [[Leopoldo Nobili]] in 1825,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nobili|first1=Leopoldo|title=Sur un nouveau galvanom\u00e8tre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences|journal=Biblioth\u00e8que universelle|date=1825|volume=29|pages=119\u2013125|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052859663;view=1up;seq=125|trans-title=On a new galvanometer presented at the Academy of Sciences|language=French}}</ref> it consists of two magnetized needles parallel to each other but with the magnetic poles reversed.

The purpose of the second needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the suspended armature has no net [[magnetic dipole moment]], and thus is not affected by the earth's magnetic field.  The needle's rotation is opposed by the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to the angle.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Nobili's astatic galvanometer\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%;\">\nFile:Galvanometer-MHS 229-IMG 3875-gradient.jpg|Galvanometer on display at [[Mus\u00e9e d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve]]\nFile:Astatic Galvanometer brass and ivory.jpg|Detail of an astatic galvanometer.\n</gallery>\n\n===Mirror galvanometer===\n{{main article|mirror galvanometer}}\nTo achieve higher sensitivity to detect extremely small currents, the [[mirror galvanometer]] substitutes a lightweight mirror for the pointer.  It consists of horizontal magnets suspended from a fine fiber, inside a vertical coil of wire, with a mirror attached to the magnets.  A beam of light reflected from the mirror falls on a graduated scale across the room, acting as a long mass-less pointer. The mirror galvanometer was used as the receiver in the first trans-Atlantic [[submarine communications cable|submarine telegraph cables]] in the 1850s, to detect the extremely faint pulses of current after their thousand-mile journey under the Atlantic. In a device called an [[oscillograph]], the moving beam of light is used, to produce graphs of current versus time, by recording measurements on photographic film. The [[string galvanometer]] is a type of mirror galvanometer so sensitive that it was used to make the first [[electrocardiogram]] of the electrical activity of the human heart.\n\n===Ballistic galvanometer===\n{{main article|Ballistic galvanometer}}\nA ballistic galvanometer is a type of sensitive galvanometer for measuring the quantity of [[Electric charge|charge]] discharged through it. In reality it is an [[integrator]], unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large [[moment of inertia]] that gives it a long [[oscillation]] period. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type; commonly it is a [[mirror galvanometer]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vibration galvanometer]]\n* [[Thermo galvanometer]]\n* [[String galvanometer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Galvanometers}}\n* [https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/galvanometer Galvanometer - Interactive Java Tutorial] National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n* [http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/technology/search?-max=10&-title=1&-op_varioid=numerical&varioid=7 Selection of historic galvanometer] in the [[Virtual Laboratory]] of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]\n\n{{Electrical and electronic measuring equipment}}\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Galvanometers]]\n[[Category:Electrical instruments]]\n[[Category:Historical scientific instruments]]\n", "name_user": "Mstrogoff", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added external reference.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer"}

The club, founded in 1927, hails from [[Coleraine]], County Londonderry and plays its home matches at [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|The Showgrounds]]. Club colours are blue and white. The club won the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]] title once (in [[1973\u201374 Irish League|1973\u201374]]) and the [[Irish Cup]] on six occasions, most recently in 2017\u201318. They are also the only Irish League club to have won two successive all-Ireland competitions, lifting the [[Blaxnit Cup]] in 1969 and 1970. The club is bitter rivals with [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] with their matches being known as the \"North West Derby\".\n\n==History==\nThe original Coleraine Football Club was founded in June 1927 originally called '''Coleraine FC'''  at a meeting in the local Orange hall. The club was formed out of a merger between two local sides: '''Coleraine Olympic''' and '''Coleraine Alexandra'''. The original club colours were all white, hence the club's original nickname \u2013 the Snowmen. Theyclub secured its first trophy in the 1931\u201332 season, defeating [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] 3\u20130 at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] to win the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]].\n\nIn 1948, Coleraine reached its first [[Irish Cup]] final, going down 3\u20130 to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. 1953 brought another appearance in the final and another defeat, again to Linfield, this time by five goals to nil. The 1950s saw the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]] won for the first time (1953\u201354) and a second triumph in the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] (1958).\n\nIn 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded [[Bertie Peacock]] to sign for Coleraine after he left [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club's history. In 1965, Coleraine won the [[Irish Cup]] for the first time, defeating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 at [[Windsor Park]], with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] outfit [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kiev]]. Coleraine also won the first two [[Blaxnit Cup|Blaxnit all-Ireland cup]]s in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the 1970 [[Fairs Cup]], and after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3\u20132 victory thanks to a [[Des Dickson (footballer, born 1948)|Des Dickson]] hat-trick.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Irish Cup]] was won again, this time by beating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] 2\u20131, with goals from Des Dickson and [[Ivan Murray]]. The [[Holy Grail]] of the [[IFA Premiership|Gibson Cup]] was finally captured in 1974. Under the management of Bertie Peacock, the squad consisting of the likes of Des Dickson, Johnny McCurdy, Ivan Murray, Michael Guy and Vince Magee clinched the title ahead of [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]]. Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the [[Irish Cup]] was won twice more \u2013 both times against [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. In 1975, it took three games before a goal from Jim \"Chang\" Smith in the second replay proved decisive. The 1977 victory was more emphatic with [[Liam Beckett]], Des Dickson, Frankie Moffatt and Michael Guy scoring to give Coleraine a 4\u20131 victory. It was to be the club's last major trophy for 26 years.\n\nIn the 1980s there were two more cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, ending in defeats to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] and [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] respectively. For three seasons in a row in the mid-1980s the club finished second in the league behind Linfield, but in the first part of the 1990s Coleraine struggled. In 1995 they dropped into the First Division. Under [[Kenny Shiels]], Coleraine won the inaugural First Division title and in its first season back in the top flight, won the [[Ulster Cup]] and came agonisingly close to the title, being pipped late on by [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]].\n\nAfter a poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from [[Gareth McAuley]] was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through [[Jody Tolan]]. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant.\n\nThe club's well-publicised financial problems had already overshadowed much of the 2003\u201304 season (despite a substantial donation from ''Cold Feet'' actor and Coleraine fan [[James Nesbitt]]) and at its end the club was forced to operate on a reduced budget, with several top players leaving. Despite this a top six finish was still achieved. The summer of 2005 saw more budget cuts and several big names leaving the Showgrounds, but this time the main concern for fans was the very future of the club. In August, the [[Inland Revenue]] filed for a winding-up order against Coleraine due to debts of \u00a31.3 million. The Friends of Coleraine, worked tirelessly to persuade the High Court to postpone the hearing to allow them to put together a business plan to show that the club could be viably run. The club were liquidated on 9 August 2006 after they were allowed to enter administration, and a steering committee was set up to run the new club Coleraine FC Ltd.\n\nThe club went on to defeat [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] to win the [[North West Senior Cup]] for the 1st time. The club were incredibly allowed to stay in the Premier League and survival was ensured on the pitch, the Friends of Coleraine formally took control of the club and appointed a new board. In 2008 the club reached the Irish Cup final, but lost 2\u20131 to Linfield. Manager Marty Quinn resigned after that game and his successor, former assistant David Platt, led Coleraine to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge.\n\nOn 27 March 2010, Coleraine narrowly lost on penalties against Glentoran in the final of the [[Northern Irish League Cup|Co-Operative Insurance Cup]]. They also lost out to Linfield in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup. Despite possessing the two top goalscorers in the league, including 41 goal [[Rory Patterson]], Coleraine could only finish the season in seventh. Despite the arrival of much-travelled English striker [[Leon Knight]], inconsistent form throughout the first half of the 2010\u201311 season resulted in manager David Platt being sacked at the start of February. His replacement, Oran Kearney revitalised a struggling team and they climbed the table rapidly, again ending up seventh.\n\nAn overhaul of the squad over the summer saw Kearney put his mark on the club and the improvement shown in his first four months in charge then continued, with Coleraine performing well in the league and reaching the final of the IRN-BRU League Cup.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 Coleraine finished the season in 6th place after making the split five games previously.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, after many average seasons, the Bannsiders hit title winning form, going on a winning run with it being halted after a while by [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. They started to fall away after that result, being knocked out of the [[Irish Cup]] by 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] and finished in 5th place and lost the Europa League Play-off by 2\u20131 to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].\n\nThe 2016\u20132017 was a fairly good one for the Bannsiders with them currently sitting an impressive 3rd in the table and they also booked their place in the 2017 Irish Cup Final by beating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 to reach their first final in nine years, where they lost 3\u20130 to the double winners [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. \n\nAt the start of the 2017/18 season 'The Bannsiders' made a few new signings. [[Josh Carson]], who came from Linfield originally playing for York City and Ipswich Town, signed for Coleraine as well as Aaron Traynor and Stephen O'Donnell from Warrenpoint Town and Institute respectively. They started their pre-season off well by beating Bangor City 3\u20131. They were then defeated in the Europa League first round qualifier by Haugesund from Norway. During the 2017/18 season, the Bannsiders went on an amazing run, losing once only to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[NIFL Premiership]], finally finishing in second place, two points behind Crusaders. Although Coleraine did not attain the title, a sixth Irish Cup triumph was secured when they defeated Cliftonville in the final of that competition in May, thanks to the heroics of starlet Aaron Burns. \n\nOran Kearney left the club to take over at [[SPFL Premiership]] side [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in September 2018, and was replaced by [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]] manager Rodney McAree, who guided Coleraine to a sixth-place finish and an Irish Cup semi-final. Following a failure to win the Europa League playoffs, McAree was sacked on 10 May 2019, having only been in charge for eight months. Kearney departed St. Mirren via mutual agreement to rejoin Coleraine as manager on 3 July 2019, citing family reasons and a lack of ambition on his part due to full time football being outside his appetite. Kearney settled back into his role as manager of Coleraine for a second spell. The summer transfer window of 19/20 caused some controversy with Kearney allowing star striker Jamie McGonigle to leave for a paltry sum, of \u00a32,000, while Aaron Burns was also allowed to leave for free, despite Kearney spending \u00a320,000 on the winger 18 months previously. \n\nDespite losing their two best players in McGonigle and Burns, Coleraine started the season well, recording notable victories over reigning Champions and runners ups, Linfield and Ballymena respectively. With the club involved in a five way title race, the club opted to bolster their squad in the January window with the club record signing of Nixon from Carrick for \u00a330,000. \n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The club, founded in 1927, hails from [[Coleraine]], County Londonderry and plays its home matches at [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|The Showgrounds]]. Club colours are blue and white. The club won the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]] title once (in [[1973\u201374 Irish League|1973\u201374]]) and the [[Irish Cup]] on six occasions, most recently in 2017\u201318. They are also the only Irish League club to have won two successive all-Ireland competitions, lifting the [[Blaxnit Cup]] in 1969 and 1970. The club is bitter rivals with [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] with their matches being known as the \"North West Derby\".\n\n==History==\nThe original Coleraine Football Club was founded in June 1927 originally called '''Coleraine FC'''  at a meeting in the local Orange hall. The club was formed out of a merger between two local sides: '''Coleraine Olympic''' and '''Coleraine Alexandra'''. The original club colours were all white, hence the club's original nickname \u2013 the Snowmen. Theyclub secured its first trophy in the 1931\u201332 season, defeating [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] 3\u20130 at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] to win the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]].\n\nIn 1948, Coleraine reached its first [[Irish Cup]] final, going down 3\u20130 to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. 1953 brought another appearance in the final and another defeat, again to Linfield, this time by five goals to nil. The 1950s saw the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]] won for the first time (1953\u201354) and a second triumph in the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] (1958).\n\nIn 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded [[Bertie Peacock]] to sign for Coleraine after he left [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club's history. In 1965, Coleraine won the [[Irish Cup]] for the first time, defeating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 at [[Windsor Park]], with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] outfit [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kiev]]. Coleraine also won the first two [[Blaxnit Cup|Blaxnit all-Ireland cup]]s in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the 1970 [[Fairs Cup]], and after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3\u20132 victory thanks to a [[Des Dickson (footballer, born 1948)|Des Dickson]] hat-trick.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Irish Cup]] was won again, this time by beating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] 2\u20131, with goals from Des Dickson and [[Ivan Murray]]. The [[Holy Grail]] of the [[IFA Premiership|Gibson Cup]] was finally captured in 1974. Under the management of Bertie Peacock, the squad consisting of the likes of Des Dickson, Johnny McCurdy, Ivan Murray, Michael Guy and Vince Magee clinched the title ahead of [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]]. Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the [[Irish Cup]] was won twice more \u2013 both times against [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. In 1975, it took three games before a goal from Jim \"Chang\" Smith in the second replay proved decisive. The 1977 victory was more emphatic with [[Liam Beckett]], Des Dickson, Frankie Moffatt and Michael Guy scoring to give Coleraine a 4\u20131 victory. It was to be the club's last major trophy for 26 years.\n\nIn the 1980s there were two more cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, ending in defeats to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] and [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] respectively. For three seasons in a row in the mid-1980s the club finished second in the league behind Linfield, but in the first part of the 1990s Coleraine struggled. In 1995 they dropped into the First Division. Under [[Kenny Shiels]], Coleraine won the inaugural First Division title and in its first season back in the top flight, won the [[Ulster Cup]] and came agonisingly close to the title, being pipped late on by [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]].\n\nAfter a poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from [[Gareth McAuley]] was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through [[Jody Tolan]]. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant.\n\nThe club's well-publicised financial problems had already overshadowed much of the 2003\u201304 season (despite a substantial donation from ''Cold Feet'' actor and Coleraine fan [[James Nesbitt]]) and at its end the club was forced to operate on a reduced budget, with several top players leaving. Despite this a top six finish was still achieved. The summer of 2005 saw more budget cuts and several big names leaving the Showgrounds, but this time the main concern for fans was the very future of the club. In August, the [[Inland Revenue]] filed for a winding-up order against Coleraine due to debts of \u00a31.3 million. The Friends of Coleraine, worked tirelessly to persuade the High Court to postpone the hearing to allow them to put together a business plan to show that the club could be viably run. The club were liquidated on 9 August 2006 after they were allowed to enter administration, and a steering committee was set up to run the new club Coleraine FC Ltd.\n\nThe club went on to defeat [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] to win the [[North West Senior Cup]] for the 1st time. The club were incredibly allowed to stay in the Premier League and survival was ensured on the pitch, the Friends of Coleraine formally took control of the club and appointed a new board. In 2008 the club reached the Irish Cup final, but lost 2\u20131 to Linfield. Manager Marty Quinn resigned after that game and his successor, former assistant David Platt, led Coleraine to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge.\n\nOn 27 March 2010, Coleraine narrowly lost on penalties against Glentoran in the final of the [[Northern Irish League Cup|Co-Operative Insurance Cup]]. They also lost out to Linfield in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup. Despite possessing the two top goalscorers in the league, including 41 goal [[Rory Patterson]], Coleraine could only finish the season in seventh. Despite the arrival of much-travelled English striker [[Leon Knight]], inconsistent form throughout the first half of the 2010\u201311 season resulted in manager David Platt being sacked at the start of February. His replacement, Oran Kearney revitalised a struggling team and they climbed the table rapidly, again ending up seventh.\n\nAn overhaul of the squad over the summer saw Kearney put his mark on the club and the improvement shown in his first four months in charge then continued, with Coleraine performing well in the league and reaching the final of the IRN-BRU League Cup.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 Coleraine finished the season in 6th place after making the split five games previously.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, after many average seasons, the Bannsiders hit title winning form, going on a winning run with it being halted after a while by [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. They started to fall away after that result, being knocked out of the [[Irish Cup]] by 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] and finished in 5th place and lost the Europa League Play-off by 2\u20131 to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].\n\nThe 2016\u20132017 was a fairly good one for the Bannsiders with them currently sitting an impressive 3rd in the table and they also booked their place in the 2017 Irish Cup Final by beating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 to reach their first final in nine years, where they lost 3\u20130 to the double winners [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. \n\nAt the start of the 2017/18 season 'The Bannsiders' made a few new signings. [[Josh Carson]], who came from Linfield originally playing for York City and Ipswich Town, signed for Coleraine as well as Aaron Traynor and Stephen O'Donnell from Warrenpoint Town and Institute respectively. They started their pre-season off well by beating Bangor City 3\u20131. They were then defeated in the Europa League first round qualifier by Haugesund from Norway. During the 2017/18 season, the Bannsiders went on an amazing run, losing once only to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[NIFL Premiership]], finally finishing in second place, two points behind Crusaders. Although Coleraine did not attain the title, a sixth Irish Cup triumph was secured when they defeated Cliftonville in the final of that competition in May, thanks to the heroics of starlet Aaron Burns. \n\nOran Kearney left the club to take over at [[SPFL Premiership]] side [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in September 2018, and was replaced by [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]] manager Rodney McAree, who guided Coleraine to a sixth-place finish and an Irish Cup semi-final. Following a failure to win the Europa League playoffs, McAree was sacked on 10 May 2019, having only been in charge for eight months. Kearney departed St. Mirren via mutual agreement to rejoin Coleraine as manager on 3 July 2019, citing family reasons and a lack of ambition on his part due to full time football being outside his appetite. Kearney settled back into his role as manager of Coleraine for a second spell. The summer transfer window of 19/20 caused some controversy with Kearney allowing star striker Jamie McGonigle to leave for a paltry sum, of \u00a32,000, while Aaron Burns was also allowed to leave for free, despite Kearney spending \u00a320,000 on the winger 18 months previously. \n\nDespite losing their two best players in McGonigle and Burns, Coleraine started the season well, recording notable victories over reigning Champions and runners ups, Linfield and Ballymena respectively. With the club involved in a five way title race, the club opted to bolster their squad in the January window with the club record signing of Nixon from Carrick for \u00a330,000. \n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the principal source of the longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate [[Nile#Sources|source of the Nile]], is more often considered to be one of the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]]. The uppermost section of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the [[White Nile]] and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north.\n\nThe lake exhibits [[Eutrophication|eutrophic conditions]]. In 1990\u20131991, oxygen concentrations in the mixed layer were higher than in 1960\u20131961, with nearly continuous oxygen supersaturation in surface waters. Oxygen concentrations in [[Hypolimnion|hypolimnetic waters]] (i.e. the layer of water that lies below the [[thermocline]], is noncirculating, and remains perpetually cold) were lower in 1990\u20131991 for a longer period than in 1960\u20131961, with values of less than 1&nbsp;mg per litre (< 0.4&nbsp;[[Grain (mass)|gr]]/cu&nbsp;ft) occurring in water as shallow as {{convert|40|m|ft}} compared with a shallowest occurrence of greater than {{convert|50|m|ft}} in 1961.

At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia ''O. esculentus'', as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as \"trash fish\" or even [[vermin]] by the British colonial authorities.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the [[Uganda Game and Fisheries Department]] (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962\u201363.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954\u201355 under the directive of senior officials.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970.<ref name=\"Lowe2009\"/> Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Lowe2009\"/>\n\nDue to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted. The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch.\nThe subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.\n\nHundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened. Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries. Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet.\nToday, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehighlight.org/entertainment-and-recreation/nature/nile-perch-and-the-future-of-lake-victoria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111223808/http://www.homehighlight.org/entertainment-and-recreation/nature/nile-perch-and-the-future-of-lake-victoria.html |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Water hyacinth invasion===\n{{Main|Water hyacinth in Lake Victoria}}\n[[File:NdereIsland3.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Water hyacinth|hyacinth]]-choked lakeshore at [[Ndere Island]], Lake Victoria, [[Kenya]].]]\n\nThe [[water hyacinth]] has become a major [[invasive plant species]] in Lake Victoria.\n\nThe release of large amounts of untreated wastewater (sewage) and agricultural and industrial runoff directly into Lake Victoria over the past 30 years has greatly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake \"triggering massive growth of exotic water hyacinth, which colonised the lake in the late 1990s\".<ref name=\"Luilo\">Luilo, G.B.

Public awareness exercises were also conducted.<ref name=\"Albright2004\"/> More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth.<ref name=\"Albright2004\"/><ref>Ochiel, G.S., A.M.

In addition to the [[biogas]] it produces, its by-product can be used as [[fertilizer]].<ref name=\"Sayer2018\"/>\n\nOther factors which may have contributed to the decline of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Ni\u00f1o during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself.<ref name=\"Albright2004\"/> The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.<ref>Crisman, T.L., Chapman, Lauren J., Chapman, Colin A., & Kaufman, Les S.

Its shores in particular are dotted with the key cities and towns, including [[Kisumu]], [[Kisii, Kenya|Kisii]], and [[Homa Bay]] in Kenya; [[Kampala]], [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] and Entebbe in Uganda; and Bukoba, [[Mwanza]], and [[Musoma]] in Tanzania. These cities and towns also are home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its influent rivers. Likewise, set up of small beaches and local authorities around the lake, lack proper sewage treatment facilities therefore allowing pollutants find their way into the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/nationprime/poisons-lake-victoria-kenya/5279428-5458326-xlnisn/index.html|title=Toxic dump: The poisons killing lake Victoria|website=Daily Nation|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>  Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its [[eutrophication]] that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth.<ref name=\"earthobservatory.nasa.gov\">{{cite news |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7426 |title=Water Hyacinth Re-invades Lake Victoria |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=February 21, 2007 |work=Image of the Dat}}</ref> Increased [[logging]] and act of [[deforestation]] has led to environmental degradation around the region reducing the absorption of polluting chemicals and deteriorating the water quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001249889/scientists-raise-concerns-over-pollution-of-lake-victoria|title=Scientists raise concerns over pollution of Lake Victoria|last=Odhiambo|first=Harold|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental data ===\nAs of 2016, an environmental data repository exists for [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/LakeVicFish Lake Victoria].

Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, who had been recovering from illness at the time and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to have been the true source of the Nile River, which Burton regarded as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery.<ref name = \"DNB\">{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Speke, John Hanning}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, the famous British [[explorer]] and [[missionary]] [[David Livingstone]] failed in his attempt to verify Speke's discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the [[River Congo]] system instead.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jambokenya.com/jambo/location/victoria.htm| archive-url=https://archive.is/19970617231906/http://www.jambokenya.com/jambo/location/victoria.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=17 June 1997| title=Kenya, Africa \u2013 Lake Victoria in Kenya| publisher=Jambo Kenya Network| accessdate=14 July 2008}}</ref> Ultimately, the [[Welsh-American]] explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]], on an expedition funded by the ''[[New York Herald]]'' newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke's discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\n==Nalubaale Dam==\n{{Main|Nalubaale Power Station}}\n[[File:From top of Nalubaale Power Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Njeru]], Uganda.]]\n\nThe only outflow for Lake Victoria is at Jinja, Uganda, where it forms the Victoria Nile. The water since at least 12,000 years ago drained across a natural rock weir. In 1952, engineers acting for the government of [[British Uganda]] blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir. A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the \"agreed curve\" was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 [[Cubic metre per second|cubic metres per second]] (392\u20132,224 [[cubic yard|cu&nbsp;yd]]/sec) depending on the lake's water level.\n\nIn 2002, Uganda completed a second [[hydroelectric]] complex in the area, the [[Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station]], with [[World Bank]] assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18925384.100 |title=Uganda pulls plug on Lake Victoria  |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=9 February 2006 |author=Fred Pearce |volume=2538 |page=12}}</ref> and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level.\n\n==Transport==\n<!--[[File:Lake Victoria SPOT 1128.jpg|thumb|right|Baumann Gulf in the Tanzanian portion of Lake Victoria]]-->\n{{main|Lake Victoria ferries}}\n\nSince the 1900s, [[Lake Victoria ferries]] have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya.

In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the principal source of the longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate [[Nile#Sources|source of the Nile]], is more often considered to be one of the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]]. The uppermost section of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the [[White Nile]] and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north.\n\nThe lake exhibits [[Eutrophication|eutrophic conditions]]. In 1990\u20131991, oxygen concentrations in the mixed layer were higher than in 1960\u20131961, with nearly continuous oxygen supersaturation in surface waters. Oxygen concentrations in [[Hypolimnion|hypolimnetic waters]] (i.e. the layer of water that lies below the [[thermocline]], is noncirculating, and remains perpetually cold) were lower in 1990\u20131991 for a longer period than in 1960\u20131961, with values of less than 1&nbsp;mg per litre (< 0.4&nbsp;[[Grain (mass)|gr]]/cu&nbsp;ft) occurring in water as shallow as {{convert|40|m|ft}} compared with a shallowest occurrence of greater than {{convert|50|m|ft}} in 1961. The changes in oxygenation are considered consistent with measurements of higher algal biomass and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240845630  | author1=R.E.

At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia ''O. esculentus'', as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as \"trash fish\" or even [[vermin]] by the British colonial authorities.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the [[Uganda Game and Fisheries Department]] (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962\u201363.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954\u201355 under the directive of senior officials.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists.<ref name=\"Pringle2005\"/> The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970.<ref name=\"Lowe2009\"/> Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Lowe2009\"/>\n\nDue to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted. The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch.\nThe subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.\n\nHundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened. Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries. Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet.\nToday, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehighlight.org/entertainment-and-recreation/nature/nile-perch-and-the-future-of-lake-victoria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111223808/http://www.homehighlight.org/entertainment-and-recreation/nature/nile-perch-and-the-future-of-lake-victoria.html |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Water hyacinth invasion===\n{{Main|Water hyacinth in Lake Victoria}}\n[[File:NdereIsland3.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Water hyacinth|hyacinth]]-choked lakeshore at [[Ndere Island]], Lake Victoria, [[Kenya]].]]\n\nThe [[water hyacinth]] has become a major [[invasive plant species]] in Lake Victoria.\n\nThe release of large amounts of untreated wastewater (sewage) and agricultural and industrial runoff directly into Lake Victoria over the past 30 years has greatly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake \"triggering massive growth of exotic water hyacinth, which colonised the lake in the late 1990s\".<ref name=\"Luilo\">Luilo, G.B.

Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself.<ref name=\"Albright2004\"/> The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.<ref>Crisman, T.L., Chapman, Lauren J., Chapman, Colin A., & Kaufman, Les S.

Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria.

A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery.<ref name = \"DNB\">{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Speke, John Hanning}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, the famous British [[explorer]] and [[missionary]] [[David Livingstone]] failed in his attempt to verify Speke's discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the [[River Congo]] system instead.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jambokenya.com/jambo/location/victoria.htm| archive-url=https://archive.is/19970617231906/http://www.jambokenya.com/jambo/location/victoria.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=17 June 1997| title=Kenya, Africa \u2013 Lake Victoria in Kenya| publisher=Jambo Kenya Network| accessdate=14 July 2008}}</ref> Ultimately, the [[Welsh-American]] explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]], on an expedition funded by the ''[[New York Herald]]'' newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke's discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\n==Nalubaale Dam==\n{{Main|Nalubaale Power Station}}\n[[File:From top of Nalubaale Power Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Njeru]], Uganda.]]\n\nThe only outflow for Lake Victoria is at Jinja, Uganda, where it forms the Victoria Nile. The water since at least 12,000 years ago drained across a natural rock weir. In 1952, engineers acting for the government of [[British Uganda]] blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir. A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the \"agreed curve\" was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 [[Cubic metre per second|cubic metres per second]] (392\u20132,224 [[cubic yard|cu&nbsp;yd]]/sec) depending on the lake's water level.\n\nIn 2002, Uganda completed a second [[hydroelectric]] complex in the area, the [[Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station]], with [[World Bank]] assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18925384.100 |title=Uganda pulls plug on Lake Victoria  |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=9 February 2006 |author=Fred Pearce |volume=2538 |page=12}}</ref> and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level.\n\n==Transport==\n<!--[[File:Lake Victoria SPOT 1128.jpg|thumb|right|Baumann Gulf in the Tanzanian portion of Lake Victoria]]-->\n{{main|Lake Victoria ferries}}\n\nSince the 1900s, [[Lake Victoria ferries]] have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The main ports on the lake are Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, [[Entebbe]], [[Port Bell]], and Jinja. Until 1963, the fastest and newest ferry, [[MV Victoria (1959)|MV ''Victoria'']], was designated a [[Royal Mail Ship]]. In 1966, [[train ferry]] services between Kenya and Tanzania were established with the introduction of {{MV|Uhuru}} and {{MV|Umoja}}. The ferry [[MV Bukoba|MV ''Bukoba'']] sank in the lake on 21 May 1996 with a loss of between 800 and 1,000 lives, making it one of Africa's worst maritime disasters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/panama-city-news-herald-sep-29-2002-p-8/|title=Diver's recover 180 bodies from Africa's worst ferry disaster|date=29 September 2002|work=Panama City News Herald|location=Panama city, Florida|page=8|url-access=subscription |via=Newspaperarchive.com|quote=The tragedy was one of Africa's deadliest maritime disasters.
