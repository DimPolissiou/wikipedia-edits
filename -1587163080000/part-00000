A military version of the three-engined [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] airliner, the KC-10 was developed from the '''Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program'''.{{#tag:ref|The [[Handley Page Jetstream]] had been initially ordered as the C-10A, but was soon canceled.  This allowed the tanker version of the DC-10 to be designated KC-10A.|group=\"N\"}} It incorporates military-specific equipment for its primary roles of transport and [[aerial refueling]]. It was developed to supplement the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] following experiences in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]. The KC-10 was the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be selected by the Air Force following the [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]. A total of 60 KC-10s were produced for the USAF.  The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] operates two similar tankers designated ''KDC-10'' that were converted from DC-10s.\n\nThe KC-10 plays a key role in the mobilization of US military assets, taking part in overseas operations far from home. These aircraft performed airlift and aerial refueling during the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|1986 bombing of Libya]] (Operation Eldorado Canyon), the 1990\u201391 [[Gulf War]] with Iraq (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] (Operation Allied Force), [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]), and [[Iraq War]] (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn). The KC-10 is expected to serve until 2043.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program===\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], doubts began to be raised regarding the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] fleet's ability to meet the needs of the United States' global commitments. The [[aerial refueling]] fleet was deployed to Southeast Asia to support tactical aircraft and strategic bombers, while maintaining the U.S.-based support of the nuclear-bomber fleet. Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10s]] were flown in trials at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.<ref name=Waddington>Waddington 2000, pp. 116\u2013120.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], the Air Force commenced [[Operation Nickel Grass]] to supply Israel with weapons and supplies. The operation demonstrated the necessity for adequate air-refueling capabilities; denied landing rights in Europe, [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]] transports were forced to carry a fraction of their maximum payload on direct flights from the continental United States to [[Israel]].<ref>Endres 1998, p.&nbsp;65.</ref><ref name=Steffan_p103>Steffan 1998, p.&nbsp;103.</ref> To address this shortfall in mobility, in 1975, under the ''Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program'', four aircraft were evaluated\u2014the Lockheed C-5, the [[Boeing 747]], the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the [[Lockheed L-1011]].<ref name=Frawley_mil>Frawley 2002, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> The only serious contenders were Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. On 19 December 1977, McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 was chosen. The primary reason of this choice was the KC-10's ability to operate from shorter runways.<ref name=Steffan_p103 /> Initially, a batch of 12 aircraft was ordered, but this was later increased to 60.<ref name=Steffan_p103 />\n\n===KC-10 Extender===\nThe KC-10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980, but it was not until October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed.<ref name=Steffan_p104>Steffan 1998, p.&nbsp;104.</ref><ref name=GS_KC10_bg>{{cite web|title=KC-10A Extender: Background|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-10-background.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref> The design for the KC-10 involved modifications from the DC-10-30CF design.

The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000&nbsp;lb (161,478&nbsp;kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity.<ref name=Steffan_p104 /> The KC-10 has both a centerline [[Flying boom|refueling boom]]\u2014unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the [[V-tail]] design used on previous tankers\u2014and a [[Probe and drogue|drogue-and-hose]] system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator is located in the rear of the aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling.

Category A required a large cargo aircraft with a range of at least 4,500&nbsp;km and the capability to refuel F-16s. In 1992, two DC-10-30CFs were acquired from [[Martinair]] in a buy/[[leaseback]] contract. When one of the two aircraft was lost in the [[Martinair Flight 495]] crash, a third aircraft was bought from Martinair.<ref name=\"dutch-kdc10-eval\"/>\n\nThe conversion was handled via the United States [[foreign military sales]] program, which in turn contracted [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5&nbsp;million (FY 1994). The aircraft were to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas did not have any experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96&nbsp;million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by [[KLM]]. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the [[AH-64 Apache]]s which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"dutch-kdc10-eval\">{{cite web |url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-26665-1.html |title=Evaluatie project KDC-10 |language=Dutch |work=Ministerie van Defensie |date=1 July 1999 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo modernize the KC-10, the USAF has awarded a contract to Boeing in 2010 to upgrade the fleet of 59 aircraft with new [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]] and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system.

In 1982 a newly renamed [[22nd Air Refueling Wing]] (formerly the 22nd Bombardment Wing) was re-equipped with KC-10A Extenders and became the 2nd Air Force Unit to operate the new tankers.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The 60th and final KC-10 was delivered on 29 November 1988.<ref>Steffen 1998, pp.&nbsp;104, 107.</ref>  The KC-10s served with SAC until 1992, when they were reassigned to the newly established [[Air Mobility Command]]. In the aerial refueling role, the KC-10s have been operated largely in the strategic refueling of large number of tactical aircraft on ferry flights and the refueling of other strategic transport aircraft. Conversely, the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] fleet has operated largely in the in-theater tactical role.

In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.<ref name=USAF_factht/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell-Douglas KC-10 Extender prepares to be refuelled by another KC-10, Exercise Talisman Saber 2017.jpg|thumb|right|A KC-10 Extender of [[Travis AFB]] approaching a second KC-10 for refuelling over the [[Pacific Ocean]], 2017]]\nSince then, the KC-10 had participated in other smaller conflicts. In March 1999, NATO launched [[Operation Allied Force]] against the government of [[Yugoslavia]]. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily dependent on tankers. By early May 1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in [[Kosovo]].<ref name=USAF_factht/> Since 11 September 2001, KC-10s had also flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies as a part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]].

A \"vertical chop\" to divest all KC-10s was suggested because there are fewer KC-10s than KC-135s, having three different tanker models in service (after the introduction of the [[KC-46]]) would be costly, and a \"horizontal cut\" across the refueling fleets would achieve small efficiencies.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2013/09/17/air-force-may-scrap-kc-10-tanker-fleet-general/ Air Force May Scrap KC-10 Tanker Fleet] \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 17 September 2013</ref> Some believed retiring the KC-10 would not benefit the Air Force, given that it is equipped with both boom and hose-and-drogue refueling systems and the fleet's relatively young age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130915/DEFREG02/309150004/ |title=USAF Weighs Scrapping KC-10, A-10 Fleets |last1=WEISGERBER |first1=MARCUS |last2=MEHTA |first2=AARON |date=15 September 2013 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media Corporation  |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> At first, officials claimed that the initial focus on retiring the KC-10 in September 2013 was a \"trial balloon\" to call attention to Air Force operating cost issues; as of early 2013, the KC-10 had a per hour flying cost of $21,170 and a mission capable rate of 87 percent.<ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/air-force-may-dump-all-a-10s/ Air Force May Scrap Entire A-10 Fleet] \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 17 October 2013</ref> A FY 2015 budget plan did not include cuts to the KC-10.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/how-hagel-spending-plan-will-transform-us-military-396320/ How Hagel spending plan will transform US military] \u2013 Flightglobal.com, 26 February 2014</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas KDC-10-30CF der RNLAF.jpg|thumb|The second [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] KDC-10 with landing gear down]]\n\nThe two Dutch KDC-10s are used for both refueling and transport.<ref>Steffen 1997, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107.</ref> They are stationed on [[Eindhoven Airport]] as part of the 334th Transport Squadron.

A military version of the three-engined [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] airliner, the KC-10 was developed from the '''Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program'''.{{#tag:ref|The [[Handley Page Jetstream]] had been initially ordered as the C-10A, but was soon canceled.  This allowed the tanker version of the DC-10 to be designated KC-10A.|group=\"N\"}} It incorporates military-specific equipment for its primary roles of transport and [[aerial refueling]]. It was developed to supplement the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] following experiences in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]. The KC-10 was the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be selected by the Air Force following the [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]. A total of 60 KC-10s were produced for the USAF.  The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] operates two similar tankers designated ''KDC-10'' that were converted from DC-10s.\n\nThe KC-10 plays a key role in the mobilization of US military assets, taking part in overseas operations far from home. These aircraft performed airlift and aerial refueling during the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|1986 bombing of Libya]] (Operation Eldorado Canyon), the 1990\u201391 [[Gulf War]] with Iraq (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] (Operation Allied Force), [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]), and [[Iraq War]] (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn). The KC-10 is expected to serve until 2043.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program===\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], doubts began to be raised regarding the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] fleet's ability to meet the needs of the United States' global commitments. The [[aerial refueling]] fleet was deployed to Southeast Asia to support tactical aircraft and strategic bombers, while maintaining the U.S.-based support of the nuclear-bomber fleet. Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10s]] were flown in trials at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.<ref name=Waddington>Waddington 2000, pp. 116\u2013120.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], the Air Force commenced [[Operation Nickel Grass]] to supply Israel with weapons and supplies. The operation demonstrated the necessity for adequate air-refueling capabilities; denied landing rights in Europe, [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]] transports were forced to carry a fraction of their maximum payload on direct flights from the continental United States to [[Israel]].<ref>Endres 1998, p.&nbsp;65.</ref><ref name=Steffan_p103>Steffan 1998, p.&nbsp;103.</ref> To address this shortfall in mobility, in 1975, under the ''Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program'', four aircraft were evaluated\u2014the Lockheed C-5, the [[Boeing 747]], the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the [[Lockheed L-1011]].<ref name=Frawley_mil>Frawley 2002, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> The only serious contenders were Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. On 19 December 1977, McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 was chosen. The primary reason of this choice was the KC-10's ability to operate from shorter runways.<ref name=Steffan_p103 /> Initially, a batch of 12 aircraft was ordered, but this was later increased to 60.<ref name=Steffan_p103 />\n\n===KC-10 Extender===\nThe KC-10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980, but it was not until October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed.<ref name=Steffan_p104>Steffan 1998, p.&nbsp;104.</ref><ref name=GS_KC10_bg>{{cite web|title=KC-10A Extender: Background|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-10-background.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref> The design for the KC-10 involved modifications from the DC-10-30CF design.

The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000&nbsp;lb (161,478&nbsp;kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity.<ref name=Steffan_p104 /> The KC-10 has both a centerline [[Flying boom|refueling boom]]\u2014unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the [[V-tail]] design used on previous tankers\u2014and a [[Probe and drogue|drogue-and-hose]] system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage.

Category A required a large cargo aircraft with a range of at least 4,500&nbsp;km and the capability to refuel F-16s. In 1992, two DC-10-30CFs were acquired from [[Martinair]] in a buy/[[leaseback]] contract. When one of the two aircraft was lost in the [[Martinair Flight 495]] crash, a third aircraft was bought from Martinair.<ref name=\"dutch-kdc10-eval\"/>\n\nThe conversion was handled via the United States [[foreign military sales]] program, which in turn contracted [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5&nbsp;million (FY 1994). The aircraft were to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas did not have any experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96&nbsp;million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by [[KLM]]. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the [[AH-64 Apache]]s which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"dutch-kdc10-eval\">{{cite web |url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-26665-1.html |title=Evaluatie project KDC-10 |language=Dutch |work=Ministerie van Defensie |date=1 July 1999 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo modernize the KC-10, the USAF has awarded a contract to Boeing in 2010 to upgrade the fleet of 59 aircraft with new [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]] and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system.

In 1982 a newly renamed [[22nd Air Refueling Wing]] (formerly the 22nd Bombardment Wing) was re-equipped with KC-10A Extenders and became the 2nd Air Force Unit to operate the new tankers.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The 60th and final KC-10 was delivered on 29 November 1988.<ref>Steffen 1998, pp.&nbsp;104, 107.</ref>  The KC-10s served with SAC until 1992, when they were reassigned to the newly established [[Air Mobility Command]]. In the aerial refueling role, the KC-10s have been operated largely in the strategic refueling of large number of tactical aircraft on ferry flights and the refueling of other strategic transport aircraft. Conversely, the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] fleet has operated largely in the in-theater tactical role. There are 59 KC-10 Extenders in service with the USAF as of 2010.<ref name=USAF_factht/><ref name=\"fg_kc10\">{{cite web |last=Trimble |first=Stephen |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/06/24/343673/boeing-outlines-c-130h-and-kc-10-cockpit-upgrades.html |title=Boeing outlines C-130H and KC-10 cockpit upgrades |work=[[Flightglobal.com]] |date= 24 June 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref> The USAF's KC-10s are stationed primarily at [[Travis Air Force Base|Travis AFB]], California, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst formerly known as [[McGuire Air Force Base|McGuire AFB]], New Jersey.\n\n[[File:USAF F-14D and F-18C's prepare to refuel.jpg|thumb|left|A USN [[F-14D]] and two [[F/A-18C]]s prepare to refuel from a KC-10 in 2005 over the [[Persian Gulf]].]]\nWhen faced with refusals of basing and overflight rights from continental European countries during [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], the U.S. was forced to use the UK-based [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111s]] in the 1986 air-strikes against [[Libya]].

In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.<ref name=USAF_factht/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell-Douglas KC-10 Extender prepares to be refuelled by another KC-10, Exercise Talisman Saber 2017.jpg|thumb|right|A KC-10 Extender of [[Travis AFB]] approaching a second KC-10 for refuelling over the [[Pacific Ocean]], 2017]]\nSince then, the KC-10 had participated in other smaller conflicts. In March 1999, NATO launched [[Operation Allied Force]] against the government of [[Yugoslavia]]. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily dependent on tankers. By early May 1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in [[Kosovo]].<ref name=USAF_factht/> Since 11 September 2001, KC-10s had also flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies as a part of [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. During [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operations Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraqi Freedom]], KC-10s have flown more than 1,390 missions delivering critical air refueling support to numerous joint and Coalition receiver aircraft.<ref name=USAF_factht/> KC-10s are expected to serve until 2043.<ref>Veronico and Dunn 2004, p.&nbsp;58.</ref>\n\nThe Air Force considered retiring its fleet of KC-10 tankers in response to sequestration budget cuts as part of the service's FY 2015 budget.  A \"vertical chop\" to divest all KC-10s was suggested because there are fewer KC-10s than KC-135s, having three different tanker models in service (after the introduction of the [[KC-46]]) would be costly, and a \"horizontal cut\" across the refueling fleets would achieve small efficiencies.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2013/09/17/air-force-may-scrap-kc-10-tanker-fleet-general/ Air Force May Scrap KC-10 Tanker Fleet] \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 17 September 2013</ref> Some believed retiring the KC-10 would not benefit the Air Force, given that it is equipped with both boom and hose-and-drogue refueling systems and the fleet's relatively young age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130915/DEFREG02/309150004/ |title=USAF Weighs Scrapping KC-10, A-10 Fleets |last1=WEISGERBER |first1=MARCUS |last2=MEHTA |first2=AARON |date=15 September 2013 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media Corporation  |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> At first, officials claimed that the initial focus on retiring the KC-10 in September 2013 was a \"trial balloon\" to call attention to Air Force operating cost issues; as of early 2013, the KC-10 had a per hour flying cost of $21,170 and a mission capable rate of 87 percent.<ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/air-force-may-dump-all-a-10s/ Air Force May Scrap Entire A-10 Fleet] \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 17 October 2013</ref> A FY 2015 budget plan did not include cuts to the KC-10.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/how-hagel-spending-plan-will-transform-us-military-396320/ How Hagel spending plan will transform US military] \u2013 Flightglobal.com, 26 February 2014</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas KDC-10-30CF der RNLAF.jpg|thumb|The second [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] KDC-10 with landing gear down]]\n\nThe two Dutch KDC-10s are used for both refueling and transport.<ref>Steffen 1997, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107.</ref> They are stationed on [[Eindhoven Airport]] as part of the 334th Transport Squadron.
