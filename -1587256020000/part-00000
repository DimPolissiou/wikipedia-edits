Chandler's shoes are slippery, rendering his dance lessons useless. Joey tries to impress a Broadway director. Ross dances with children to impress Monica's attractive, funny friend Mona, which leads to him getting injured quite a bit.\n'''Note''': This episode is dedicated to \"The people of New York City\" in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n|LineColor=01617B\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Friends (season 8)\n|EpisodeNumber=172\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|ProdCode=227402\n|Viewers=30.04<ref name=\"tripodS08\"/>\n|Title=The One with the Red Sweater\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|10|4}}\n|WrittenBy=Dana Klein Borkow\n|DirectedBy=[[David Schwimmer]]\n|ShortSummary=Rachel won't tell anybody who the father of her baby is until she tells him. Joey tells Monica and Phoebe that a guy slept with Rachel a few weeks earlier, and left a red sweater behind. Phoebe thinks it's Tag Jones and arranges a meeting for Rachel with him. Ross and Chandler attempt to recreate the wedding pictures, after Chandler loses the disposable cameras. Monica opens all of her and Chandler's wedding presents.

Phoebe and Joey try to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment by telling Mr. Treeger there is a gas leak. However, not all goes to plan when Treeger, who could not find Monica and Chandler's key, orders firefighters to break down the door.\n'''Note''': There was a subplot of Chandler and Monica's honeymoon that was completely shot and filmed but ultimately never aired. It involved Chandler playfully joking about bombs when preparing to board first-class. The airport security mistake Chandler's joke as a real threat then take him and Monica to interrogation. Towards the end of the episode they're determined not to be a threat to the aircraft, but shortly after their release Joey calls Monica and pretends that there is a gas leak in their apartment in an attempt to cover for the broken door. When Joey asked her whether they'll charge them for the damage of breaking down the door, she sarcastically replied, \"No, I want you to stand there and wait for the entire place to blow up!\", causing the authorities to re-interrogate the couple. Following 9/11, the writers felt the humor of this subplot was [[off color humor|off color]] and quickly replaced it with a story about Chandler and Monica getting jealous over another newly married couple who got free perks by arriving just before they did. The cut scenes from this episode were later shown as a special feature on the 2004 UK version of the DVDs.\n|LineColor=01617B\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Friends (season 8)\n|EpisodeNumber=174\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|ProdCode=227406\n|Viewers=25.58<ref name=\"tripodS08\"/>\n|Title=The One with the Videotape\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|10|18}}\n|WrittenBy=[[Scott Silveri]]\n|DirectedBy=Kevin S.

However, not all goes to plan when Treeger, who could not find Monica and Chandler's key, orders firefighters to break down the door.\n'''Note''': There was a subplot of Chandler and Monica's honeymoon that was completely shot and filmed but ultimately never aired. It involved Chandler playfully joking about bombs when preparing to board first-class. The airport security mistake Chandler's joke as a real threat then take him and Monica to interrogation. Towards the end of the episode they're determined not to be a threat to the aircraft, but shortly after their release Joey calls Monica and pretends that there is a gas leak in their apartment in an attempt to cover for the broken door. When Joey asked her whether they'll charge them for the damage of breaking down the door, she sarcastically replied, \"No, I want you to stand there and wait for the entire place to blow up!\", causing the authorities to re-interrogate the couple. Following 9/11, the writers felt the humor of this subplot was [[off color humor|off color]] and quickly replaced it with a story about Chandler and Monica getting jealous over another newly married couple who got free perks by arriving just before they did.

Fashion models are sometimes featured in films (''[[Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter (film)|Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter]]'' and ''[[Looker]]''); [[Reality television|reality TV]] shows (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''); and music videos (\"[[Freedom! '90]]\", \"[[Wicked Game]]\", \"[[Daughters (John Mayer song)|Daughters]]\" and \"[[Blurred Lines]]\").\n\n[[Celebrities]], including actors, singers, [[sportsperson|sports personalities]] and reality TV stars, frequently participate in modelling contests, assignments as well as contracts in addition to their regular work.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nModelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by [[Charles Frederick Worth]], the \"father of [[haute couture]]\", when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the clothes he designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017020950/http://www.modelworker.com/history.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-17|title=modelworker.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Fabulous faces of fashion: A century of modelling|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|date=4 May 2009|author=Walker, Harriet|journal=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528025946/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/fabulous-faces-of-fashion-a--century-of-modelling-1678417.html|archive-date=2011-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> The term \"[[house model]]\" was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> through the 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], and [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] also dominated fashion.<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Cathy Horyn|date=4 February 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50s |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

This was the precursor to the [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]] competition which was established in 1980. Ford also focused their attentions on Brazil which had a wide array of seemingly \"exotic\" models, which eventually led to establishment of Ford Models Brazil.

As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s.

Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world.

The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map.

This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features.

Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans.

Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot.

As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s.

The primary use of plus-size models is to appear in advertising and runway shows for plus-size labels. Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |title=Q&A: Paul Marciano on 30 Years of Guess Campaigns |author=Tran, Khan T.L. |date=1 May 2012 |work=wwd.com |publisher=Women's Wear Daily |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706050948/http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |archive-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |title=Fashion's new Dahling; All Woman: Sophie Makes A Comeback with Three New Contracts and a Sexy, Slimmer Look. |author=Brown, Annie |date=3 July 2000 |newspaper=The Daily Record |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124720/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |archive-date=2013-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Serpe, Gina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Death Five Years On: Timeline of a Tragedy |author=Serpe, Gina |date=8 February 2012 |work=people.com |publisher=People Magazine |accessdate=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012182511/http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |archive-date=2012-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |title=Levi's Boyfriend Collection F/W 10 |work=models.com |accessdate=20 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513085352/http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Normal-size ====\n[[File:Camille_Kostek_in_New_York,_July_2017_1.png|alt=|left|thumb|196x196px|[[Camille Kostek]] is a normal-size or \"middle model\" at size 4/6]]\nAlso known as the \"in-between\" and \"middle models\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/not-middle-sized-models-fashion/|title=Why aren't there more 'middle' sized models in fashion?|last=Holt|first=Bethan|date=2018-11-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> they are neither considered catalogue size (0\u20132) nor plus-size (10 up).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brit.co/why-middle-models-left-out-of-traditional-fashion-industry/|title=Why the Average American Woman Is Being Left Out of the Traditional Fashion Industry|website=Brit + Co|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15|date=2018-05-30}}</ref> Actress [[Mindy Kaling]] has described this body type in her 2011 book ''Is Everybody Hanging out With Me'' writing, \"Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat...

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too.

Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

It combined the original Acorn ARM2 processor with a memory controller (MEMC), video controller (VIDC), and I/O controller (IOC).  In previous Acorn [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-powered computers, these were four discrete chips.

[[Multi-processor system-on-chip|Multiprocessor SoCs]] have more than one processor core by definition.\n\nWhether single-core, [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]] or [[manycore]], SoC processor cores typically use [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] instruction set architectures.  RISC architectures are advantageous over [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors for systems-on-chip because they require less digital logic, and therefore less power and area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|board]], and in the [[Embedded system|embedded]] and [[Mobile computing|mobile]] computing markets, area and power are often highly constrained.  In particular, SoC processor cores often use the [[ARM architecture]] because it is a [[Soft microprocessor|soft processor]] specified as an [[IP core]] and is more power efficient than [[x86]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />\n\n==== Memories ====\n{{Further|Computer memory}}\nSystems-on-chip must have [[semiconductor memory]] blocks to perform their computation, as do [[microcontroller]]s and other [[embedded system]]s.  Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a [[memory hierarchy]] and [[cache hierarchy]].  In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many [[Low-power electronics|low-power]] embedded microcontrollers, this is not necessary.\nMemory technologies for SoCs include [[read-only memory]] (ROM), [[random-access memory]] (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM ([[EEPROM]]) and [[flash memory]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />  As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper [[Dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  When an SoC has a [[Cache (computing)|cache]] hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement [[processor register]]s and cores' [[L1 cache]]s whereas DRAM will be used for lower levels of the cache hierarchy including [[main memory]].  \"Main memory\" may be specific to a single processor (which can be [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]) when the SoC [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|has multiple processors]], in which case it is [[distributed memory]] and must be sent via {{Section link||Intermodule communication|nopage=y}} on-chip to be accessed by a different processor.<ref name=\":1\" />  For further discussion of multi-processing memory issues, see [[cache coherence]] and [[memory latency]].\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nSoCs include external [[Electrical connector|interfaces]], typically for [[communication protocol]]s. These are often based upon industry standards such as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[Ethernet]], [[Universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter|USART]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]], [[HDMI]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc. These interfaces will differ according to the intended application. [[Wireless network]]ing protocols such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[6LoWPAN]] and [[near-field communication]] may also be supported.\n\nWhen needed, SoCs include [[Analog signal|analog]] interfaces including [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s, often for [[signal processing]].  These may be able to interface with different types of [[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s, including [[smart transducer]]s.  They may interface with application-specific [[Modularity|modules]] or shields.<ref group=\"nb\">In [[embedded system]]s, \"shields\" are analogous to [[expansion card]]s for [[Personal computer|PCs]]. They often fit over a [[microcontroller]] such as an [[Arduino]] or [[single-board computer]] such as the [[Raspberry Pi]] and function as [[peripheral]]s for the device.</ref>  Or they may be internal to the SoC, such as if an analog sensor is built in to the SoC and its readings must be converted to digital signals for mathematical processing.\n\n==== Digital signal processors ====\n[[Digital signal processor]] (DSP) cores are often included on systems-on-chip.  They perform [[signal processing]] operations in systems-on-chip for [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, [[data collection]], [[data analysis]] and multimedia processing. DSP cores typically feature [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) and [[SIMD|single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) [[instruction set architecture]]s, and are therefore highly amenable to exploiting [[instruction-level parallelism]] through [[Parallel processing (DSP implementation)|parallel processing]] and [[superscalar execution]].<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|4}}  DSP cores most often feature application-specific instructions, and as such are typically [[application-specific instruction-set processor]]s (ASIP).  Such application-specific instructions correspond to dedicated hardware [[functional unit]]s that compute those instructions.\n\nTypical DSP instructions include [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|multiply-accumulate]], [[Fast Fourier transform]], [[Fused multiply-accumulate|fused multiply-add]], and [[convolution]]s.\n\n==== Other ====\nAs with other computer systems, SoCs require [[Clock generator|timing sources]] to generate [[clock signal]]s, control execution of SoC functions and provide time context to [[signal processing]] applications of the SoC, if needed.  Popular time sources are [[crystal oscillators]] and [[phase-locked loop]]s.\n\nSystem-on-chip [[peripheral]]s including [[counter (digital)|counter]]-timers, real-time [[timer]]s and [[power-on reset]] generators. SoCs also include [[voltage regulator]]s and [[power management]] circuits.\n\n=== Intermodule communication ===\nSystems-on-chip comprise many [[execution unit]]s.  These units must often send [[data]] and [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] back and forth.  Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require [[Communications system|communications subsystems]].  Originally, as with other [[microcomputer]] technologies, [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as [[Network on a chip|networks-on-chip]] (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}</ref>\n\n==== Bus-based communication ====\nHistorically, a shared global [[bus (computing)|computer bus]] typically connected the different components, also called \"blocks\" of the System-on-Chip.<ref name=\":0\" />  A very common bus for system-on-chip communications is ARM's royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture ([[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]]) standard.\n\n[[Direct memory access]] controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or [[control unit]], thereby increasing the data [[throughput]] of the system-on-chip.  This is similar to some [[device driver]]s of peripherals on component-based [[multi-chip module]] PC architectures.\n\nComputer buses are limited in [[scalability]], supporting only up to tens of cores ([[multicore]]) on a single chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  Wire delay is not scalable due to continued [[miniaturization]], [[Computer performance|system performance]] does not scale with the number of cores attached, the SoC's [[operating frequency]] must decrease with each additional core attached for power to be sustainable, and long wires consume large amounts of electrical power. These challenges are prohibitive to supporting [[manycore]] systems on chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\n==== Network-on-Chip ====\n{{Main|Network on a chip}}\nIn the late [[2010s]], a trend of systems-on-chip implementing [[communications subsystem]]s in terms of a network-like topology instead of [[bus (computing)|bus-based]] protocols has emerged.  A trend towards [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|more processor cores on SoCs]] has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with [[Router (computing)|router]]-based [[packet switching]] known as \"[[network on a chip|networks on chip]]\" (NoCs) to overcome the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]] of bus-based networks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\nNetworks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific [[routing]], greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of [[bus contention]].  Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from [[networking protocol]]s like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and the [[Internet protocol suite]] for on-chip communication,<ref name=\":0\" /> although they typically have fewer [[network layer]]s.  Optimal network-on-chip [[network architecture]]s are an ongoing area of much research interest.  NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing [[Network topology|network topologies]] such as [[Torus interconnect|torus]], [[Hypercube internetwork topology|hypercube]], [[Mesh networking|meshes]] and [[tree network]]s to [[genetic algorithm scheduling]] to [[randomized algorithm]]s such as [[Branching random walk|random walks with branching]] and randomized [[time to live]] (TTL).\n\nMany SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of system-on-chip design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs.  Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional.  2D IC design has limited [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplanning]] choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as [[three-dimensional integrated circuit]]s (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers are looking towards building three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Design flow ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Design flow (EDA)|Physical design (electronics)|Platform-based design|l1=Electronics design flow|l3=}}{{See also|Systems design|Software design|label 2=Software design process}}[[Image:SoCDesignFlow.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|System-on-a-chip design flow]]\n\nA system on chip consists of both the [[electronic hardware|hardware]], described in {{Section link||Structure|nopage=y}}, and the [[software]] controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces.  The [[design flow (EDA)|design flow]] for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design.  The design flow must also take into account optimizations ({{Section link||Optimization goals|nopage=y}}) and constraints.\n\nMost SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP core specifications]] for the hardware elements and [[execution unit]]s, collectively \"blocks\", described above, together with software [[device driver]]s that may control their operation.  Of particular importance are the [[protocol stack]]s that drive industry-standard interfaces like [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  The hardware blocks are put together using [[computer-aided design]] tools, specifically [[electronic design automation]] tools; the [[modular programming|software modules]] are integrated using a software [[integrated development environment]].\n\nSystems-on-chip components are also often designed in [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[MATLAB]] or [[SystemC]] and converted to [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] designs through [[high-level synthesis]] (HLS) tools such as [[C to HDL]] or [[flow to HDL]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110825-mathworks/|title=Best Practices for FPGA Prototyping of MATLAB and Simulink Algorithms|date=2011-08-25|work=EEJournal|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}</ref>  HLS products called \"algorithmic synthesis\" allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to [[computer engineers]] in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1271261|title=The 'why' and 'what' of algorithmic synthesis|last=Bowyer|first=Bryan|date=2005-02-05|website=[[EE Times]]|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>  Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto [[Soft microprocessor|soft-core processors]] included in the SoC as modules in HDL as [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]].\n\nOnce the [[Computer architecture|architecture]] of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract [[hardware description language]] termed [[Register-transfer level|register transfer level]] (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis.  These elements are connected together in a hardware description language to create the full SoC design.  The logic specified to connect these components and convert between possibly different interfaces provided by different vendors is called [[glue logic]].\n\n=== Design verification ===\n{{Further|Functional verification|Signoff (electronic design automation)||label2=}}\nChips are verified for logical correctness before being sent to a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|semiconductor foundry]].  This process is called [[functional verification]] and it accounts for a significant portion of the time and energy expended in the [[Integrated circuit development|chip design life cycle]], often quoted as 70%.<ref name=\"70% verification?\">[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1264922 Is verification really 70 percent?].\" June 14, 2004.

[[Software bug|Bugs]] found in the verification stage are reported to the designer.\n\nTraditionally, engineers have employed simulation acceleration, [[emulator|emulation]] or prototyping on [[Reconfigurable computing|reprogrammable hardware]] to verify and debug hardware and software for SoC designs prior to the finalization of the design, known as [[tape-out]]. [[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping systems-on-chip because [[FPGA prototyping|FPGA prototypes]] are reprogrammable, allow [[debugging]] and are more flexible than [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs).<ref name=\"nm prototyping\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tayden.com/publications/Nanometer%20Prototyping.pdf|title=Nanometer prototyping|last=Rittman|first=Danny|date=2006-01-05|website=Tayden Design|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Reason to debug in FPGA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13550/fpga-prototyping-to-structured-asic-production-to-reduce-cost-risk-ttm.html|title=FPGA Prototyping to Structured ASIC Production to Reduce Cost, Risk & TTM|website=Design And Reuse|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nWith high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems.  Both technologies, however, operate slowly, on the order of MHz, which may be significantly slower \u2013 up to 100 times slower \u2013 than the SoC's operating frequency.  Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nFPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system's full operating frequency with real-world stimuli.  Tools such as Certus<ref>Brian Bailey, EE Times. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1317504 Tektronix hopes to shake up ASIC prototyping].\" October 30, 2012. Retrieved July 28, 2015.</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.  This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n\nIn parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of [[logic synthesis]], during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied.  This generates an output known as a [[netlist]] describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections.  These netlists are combined with the [[glue logic]] connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be [[printed circuit board|printed]] onto a chip.  This process is known as [[place and route]] and precedes [[tape-out]] in the event that the SoCs are produced as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASIC).\n\n== Optimization goals ==\nSystems-on-chip must optimize [[Power consumption|power use]], area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], communication, positioning for [[Locality of reference|locality]] between modular units and other factors.  Optimization is necessarily a design goal of systems-on-chip.  If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a [[multi-chip module]] architecture without accounting for the area utilization, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.\n\nCommon optimization targets for system-on-chip designs follow, with explanations of each.  In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, and can indeed be [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] fairly easily.  Therefore, sophisticated [[optimization algorithm]]s are often required and it may be practical to use [[approximation algorithm]]s or [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] in some cases.  Additionally, most SoC designs contain [[Multivariate optimization|multiple variables to optimize simultaneously]], so [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] solutions are sought after in SoC design.  Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of systems-on-chip and introducing [[Trade-off#Engineering|trade-offs]] in system design.\n\nFor broader coverage of trade-offs and [[requirements analysis]], see [[requirements engineering]].\n\n=== Targets ===\n\n==== Power consumption ====\nSystems-on-chip are optimized to minimize the [[Electric power#Definition|electrical power]] used to perform the SoC's functions.  Most SoCs must use low power.  SoC systems often require long [[battery life]] (such as [[smartphone]]s), can potentially spending months or years without a power source needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of [[Embedded system|embedded]] SoCs being [[Distributed computing|networked together]] in an area.  Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the [[total cost of ownership]] of the SoC.  Finally, [[waste heat]] from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy.  The amount of [[energy]] used in a circuit is the [[integral]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] consumed with respect to time, and the [[Mean value theorem|average rate]] of power consumption is the product of [[Electric current|current]] by [[voltage]].  Equivalently, by [[Ohm's law]], power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by [[Resistance (physics)|resistance]]:\n\n<math display=\"block\">P = IV = \\frac{V^2}{R} = {I^2}{R}</math>Systems-on-chip are frequently embedded in [[Mobile device|portable devices]] such as [[smartphones]], [[GPS navigation device]]s, digital [[Digital watch|watches]] (including [[smartwatch]]es) and [[netbook]]s.  Customers want long battery lives for [[mobile computing]] devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in systems-on-chip. [[Multimedia application]]s are often executed on these devices, including [[video game]]s, [[video streaming]], [[image processing]]; all of which have grown in [[computational complexity]] in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-[[Video quality|quality]] multimedia.  Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards [[3D video]] at [[high resolution]] with [[List of video compression formats|multiple standards]], so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n==== Performance per watt ====\n{{See also|Green computing}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize [[power efficiency]] in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage.  Many applications such as [[edge computing]], [[distributed processing]] and [[ambient intelligence]] require a certain level of [[Computer performance|computational performance]], but power is limited in most SoC environments.  The [[ARM architecture]] has greater performance per watt than [[x86]] in embedded systems, so it is preferred over x86 for most SoC applications requiring an [[Soft microprocessor|embedded processor]].\n\n==== Waste heat ====\n{{Main|Heat generation in integrated circuits}}{{See also|Thermal management (electronics)|Thermal design power|label 1=Thermal management in electronics}}\nSoC designs are optimized to minimize [[waste heat]] [[dissipation|output]] on the chip.  As with other [[integrated circuit]]s, heat generated due to high [[power density]] are the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] to further [[miniaturization]] of components.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Heat Management in Integrated circuits: On-chip and system-level monitoring and cooling|last=Ogrenci-Memik|first=Seda|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2015|isbn=9781849199353|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=|oclc=934678500}}</ref>{{Rp|1}}  The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven.  Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] of the circuit over time.  High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact reliability, [[stress migration]], decreased [[mean time between failures]], [[electromigration]], [[wire bonding]], [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]] and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2\u20139}}\n\nIn particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system.  Because of high [[transistor count]]s on modern devices due to [[Moore's law]], oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high [[Transistors density|transistor density]] is physically realizable from [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]] but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit's volume.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\nThese thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative [[design margin]]s, creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of [[catastrophic failure]].  Due to increased [[Transistors density|transistor densities]] as length scales get smaller, each [[Semiconductor node|process generation]] produces more heat output than the last.  Compounding this problem, system-on-chip architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous [[heat flux]]es, which cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform [[passive cooling]].<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\n==== Throughput ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications [[throughput]].\n\n==== Latency ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to minimize [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for some or all of their functions.  This can be accomplished by [[Integrated circuit layout|laying out]] elements with proper proximity and [[Locality of reference|locality]] to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, [[Execution unit|functional units]] and memories.  In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] problem equivalent to the [[boolean satisfiability problem]].\n\nFor [[Task (computing)|tasks]] running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with [[Scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]].  Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.\n\n=== Methodologies ===\n{{Further|Multi-objective optimization|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Architecture tradeoff analysis method|label3=Architecture tradeoff analysis}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}\nSystems on chip are modeled with standard hardware [[verification and validation]] techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] on the above optimization targets.\n\n==== Task scheduling ====\n[[Scheduling (computing)|Task scheduling]] is an important activity in any computer system with multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] sharing a single processor core.  It is important to reduce {{Section link||Latency|nopage=y}} and increase {{Section link||Throughput|nopage=y}} for [[embedded software]] running on an SoC's {{Section link||Processor cores|nopage=y}}.  Not every important computing activity in a system-on-chip is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving [[shared resource]]s.\n\nSoCs often schedule tasks according to [[network scheduling]] and [[Stochastic scheduling|randomized scheduling]] algorithms.\n\n==== Pipelining ====\n{{Broader|Pipeline (computing)}}\nHardware and software tasks are often pipelined in [[processor design]].  Pipelining is an important principle for [[speedup]] in [[computer architecture]].  They are frequently used in [[GPU]]s ([[graphics pipeline]]) and RISC processors (evolutions of the [[classic RISC pipeline]]), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia manipulations in the context of systems-on-chip.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Probabilistic modeling ====\nSystems-on-chip are often analyzed though [[probabilistic model]]s, {{Section link|Queueing theory|Queueing networks}} and [[Markov chain]]s.  For instance, [[Little's law]] allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through [[Poisson random variable]]s and [[Poisson process]]es.\n\n==== Markov chains ====\nSoCs are often modeled with [[Markov chain]]s, both [[Markov chain#Discrete-time Markov chain|discrete time]] and [[Markov chain#Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time]] variants.  Markov chain modeling allows [[asymptotic analysis]] of the system-on-chip's [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|steady state distribution]] of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.\n\n== Fabrication ==\n{{Ref improve section|date=March 2017}}{{See|Semiconductor device fabrication}}\n\nSoC chips are typically [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] using [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin |first1=Youn-Long Steve |title=Essential Issues in SOC Design: Designing Complex Systems-on-Chip |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781402053528 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OV9lEn9LiQC&pg=PA176}}</ref> The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design ([[place and route]]) flow to convert the designers' intent into the design of the SoC.  Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.\n\nWhen all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched.  These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.\n\nSoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:\n\n* [[Full custom]] ASIC\n* [[Standard cell]] ASIC\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\nASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://numato.com/blog/differences-between-fpga-and-asics/|title=FPGA vs ASIC: Differences between them and which one to use? \u2013 Numato Lab Help Center|website=numato.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n\nSoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.\n\nHowever, like most [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) designs, the total cost{{Clarify|reason=what kind of cost?|date=May 2018}} is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|lower yields]]{{Clarify|reason=confusing to non-experts|date=May 2018}} and higher [[non-recurring engineering]] costs.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a [[system in package]] (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single [[chip carrier|package]].  When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler.<ref>[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1153043 The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP].\" March 21, 2005.

Systems-on-Chip can be viewed as part of a larger trend towards [[embedded system|embedded computing]] and [[hardware acceleration]].\n\nAn SoC integrates a [[microcontroller]] or [[microprocessor]] with advanced peripherals like [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), [[Wi-Fi]] module, or one or more [[coprocessor]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mittal|first=Sparsh|title=A Survey on Optimized Implementation of Deep Learning Models on the NVIDIA Jetson Platform|url=https://www.academia.edu/38201537|journal=Journal of Systems Architecture|language=en|issn=1383-7621}}</ref>  Similar to how a microcontroller integrates a microprocessor with peripheral circuits and memory, an SoC can be seen as integrating a microcontroller with even more advanced [[peripheral]]s.  {{Selfref inline|For an overview of integrating system components, see [[system integration]].}}\n\n== Types ==\n[[Image:ARMSoCBlockDiagram.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|[[Microcontroller]]-based system on a chip]]In general, there are four distinguishable types of SoCs:\n\n* SoCs built around a [[microcontroller]] (\u03bcC),\n* SoCs built around a [[microprocessor]] (\u03bcP), often found in mobile phones;\n* Specialized SoCs [[Application-specific integrated circuit|designed for specific applications]] that do not fit into the above two categories, and\n* [[Programmable system-on-chip|Programmable systems-on-chip]] (PSoC), where most functionality is fixed but some functionality is [[reconfigurable computing|reprogrammable]] in a manner analogous to a [[field-programmable gate array]].\n\n[[File:KL AMD Am286LX ZX.jpg|thumb|[[AMD]] Am286ZX/LX, SoC based on [[Intel 80286]] ]]\n\n== Applications ==\nSystems-on-chip can be applied to any computing task.

It combined the original Acorn ARM2 processor with a memory controller (MEMC), video controller (VIDC), and I/O controller (IOC).  In previous Acorn [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-powered computers, these were four discrete chips.

RISC architectures are advantageous over [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors for systems-on-chip because they require less digital logic, and therefore less power and area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|board]], and in the [[Embedded system|embedded]] and [[Mobile computing|mobile]] computing markets, area and power are often highly constrained.  In particular, SoC processor cores often use the [[ARM architecture]] because it is a [[Soft microprocessor|soft processor]] specified as an [[IP core]] and is more power efficient than [[x86]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />\n\n==== Memories ====\n{{Further|Computer memory}}\nSystems-on-chip must have [[semiconductor memory]] blocks to perform their computation, as do [[microcontroller]]s and other [[embedded system]]s.  Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a [[memory hierarchy]] and [[cache hierarchy]].  In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many [[Low-power electronics|low-power]] embedded microcontrollers, this is not necessary.\nMemory technologies for SoCs include [[read-only memory]] (ROM), [[random-access memory]] (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM ([[EEPROM]]) and [[flash memory]].<ref name=\"Furber ARM\" />  As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper [[Dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  When an SoC has a [[Cache (computing)|cache]] hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement [[processor register]]s and cores' [[L1 cache]]s whereas DRAM will be used for lower levels of the cache hierarchy including [[main memory]].  \"Main memory\" may be specific to a single processor (which can be [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]) when the SoC [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|has multiple processors]], in which case it is [[distributed memory]] and must be sent via {{Section link||Intermodule communication|nopage=y}} on-chip to be accessed by a different processor.<ref name=\":1\" />  For further discussion of multi-processing memory issues, see [[cache coherence]] and [[memory latency]].\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nSoCs include external [[Electrical connector|interfaces]], typically for [[communication protocol]]s. These are often based upon industry standards such as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[Ethernet]], [[Universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter|USART]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]], [[HDMI]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc. These interfaces will differ according to the intended application. [[Wireless network]]ing protocols such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[6LoWPAN]] and [[near-field communication]] may also be supported.\n\nWhen needed, SoCs include [[Analog signal|analog]] interfaces including [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s, often for [[signal processing]].  These may be able to interface with different types of [[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s, including [[smart transducer]]s.  They may interface with application-specific [[Modularity|modules]] or shields.<ref group=\"nb\">In [[embedded system]]s, \"shields\" are analogous to [[expansion card]]s for [[Personal computer|PCs]]. They often fit over a [[microcontroller]] such as an [[Arduino]] or [[single-board computer]] such as the [[Raspberry Pi]] and function as [[peripheral]]s for the device.</ref>  Or they may be internal to the SoC, such as if an analog sensor is built in to the SoC and its readings must be converted to digital signals for mathematical processing.\n\n==== Digital signal processors ====\n[[Digital signal processor]] (DSP) cores are often included on systems-on-chip.  They perform [[signal processing]] operations in systems-on-chip for [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, [[data collection]], [[data analysis]] and multimedia processing. DSP cores typically feature [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) and [[SIMD|single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) [[instruction set architecture]]s, and are therefore highly amenable to exploiting [[instruction-level parallelism]] through [[Parallel processing (DSP implementation)|parallel processing]] and [[superscalar execution]].<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|4}}  DSP cores most often feature application-specific instructions, and as such are typically [[application-specific instruction-set processor]]s (ASIP).  Such application-specific instructions correspond to dedicated hardware [[functional unit]]s that compute those instructions.\n\nTypical DSP instructions include [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|multiply-accumulate]], [[Fast Fourier transform]], [[Fused multiply-accumulate|fused multiply-add]], and [[convolution]]s.\n\n==== Other ====\nAs with other computer systems, SoCs require [[Clock generator|timing sources]] to generate [[clock signal]]s, control execution of SoC functions and provide time context to [[signal processing]] applications of the SoC, if needed.  Popular time sources are [[crystal oscillators]] and [[phase-locked loop]]s.\n\nSystem-on-chip [[peripheral]]s including [[counter (digital)|counter]]-timers, real-time [[timer]]s and [[power-on reset]] generators. SoCs also include [[voltage regulator]]s and [[power management]] circuits.\n\n=== Intermodule communication ===\nSystems-on-chip comprise many [[execution unit]]s.  These units must often send [[data]] and [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] back and forth.  Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require [[Communications system|communications subsystems]].  Originally, as with other [[microcomputer]] technologies, [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as [[Network on a chip|networks-on-chip]] (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}</ref>\n\n==== Bus-based communication ====\nHistorically, a shared global [[bus (computing)|computer bus]] typically connected the different components, also called \"blocks\" of the System-on-Chip.<ref name=\":0\" />  A very common bus for system-on-chip communications is ARM's royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture ([[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]]) standard.\n\n[[Direct memory access]] controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or [[control unit]], thereby increasing the data [[throughput]] of the system-on-chip.

These challenges are prohibitive to supporting [[manycore]] systems on chip.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\n==== Network-on-Chip ====\n{{Main|Network on a chip}}\nIn the late [[2010s]], a trend of systems-on-chip implementing [[communications subsystem]]s in terms of a network-like topology instead of [[bus (computing)|bus-based]] protocols has emerged.  A trend towards [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|more processor cores on SoCs]] has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}  This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with [[Router (computing)|router]]-based [[packet switching]] known as \"[[network on a chip|networks on chip]]\" (NoCs) to overcome the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]] of bus-based networks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|xiii}}\n\nNetworks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific [[routing]], greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of [[bus contention]].  Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from [[networking protocol]]s like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and the [[Internet protocol suite]] for on-chip communication,<ref name=\":0\" /> although they typically have fewer [[network layer]]s.  Optimal network-on-chip [[network architecture]]s are an ongoing area of much research interest.  NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing [[Network topology|network topologies]] such as [[Torus interconnect|torus]], [[Hypercube internetwork topology|hypercube]], [[Mesh networking|meshes]] and [[tree network]]s to [[genetic algorithm scheduling]] to [[randomized algorithm]]s such as [[Branching random walk|random walks with branching]] and randomized [[time to live]] (TTL).\n\nMany SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of system-on-chip design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs.  Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional.  2D IC design has limited [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplanning]] choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as [[three-dimensional integrated circuit]]s (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers are looking towards building three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Design flow ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Design flow (EDA)|Physical design (electronics)|Platform-based design|l1=Electronics design flow|l3=}}{{See also|Systems design|Software design|label 2=Software design process}}[[Image:SoCDesignFlow.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|System-on-a-chip design flow]]\n\nA system on chip consists of both the [[electronic hardware|hardware]], described in {{Section link||Structure|nopage=y}}, and the [[software]] controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces.  The [[design flow (EDA)|design flow]] for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design.  The design flow must also take into account optimizations ({{Section link||Optimization goals|nopage=y}}) and constraints.\n\nMost SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP core specifications]] for the hardware elements and [[execution unit]]s, collectively \"blocks\", described above, together with software [[device driver]]s that may control their operation.  Of particular importance are the [[protocol stack]]s that drive industry-standard interfaces like [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  The hardware blocks are put together using [[computer-aided design]] tools, specifically [[electronic design automation]] tools; the [[modular programming|software modules]] are integrated using a software [[integrated development environment]].\n\nSystems-on-chip components are also often designed in [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[MATLAB]] or [[SystemC]] and converted to [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] designs through [[high-level synthesis]] (HLS) tools such as [[C to HDL]] or [[flow to HDL]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110825-mathworks/|title=Best Practices for FPGA Prototyping of MATLAB and Simulink Algorithms|date=2011-08-25|work=EEJournal|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}</ref>  HLS products called \"algorithmic synthesis\" allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to [[computer engineers]] in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1271261|title=The 'why' and 'what' of algorithmic synthesis|last=Bowyer|first=Bryan|date=2005-02-05|website=[[EE Times]]|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>  Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto [[Soft microprocessor|soft-core processors]] included in the SoC as modules in HDL as [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]].\n\nOnce the [[Computer architecture|architecture]] of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract [[hardware description language]] termed [[Register-transfer level|register transfer level]] (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis.  These elements are connected together in a hardware description language to create the full SoC design.

[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping systems-on-chip because [[FPGA prototyping|FPGA prototypes]] are reprogrammable, allow [[debugging]] and are more flexible than [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs).<ref name=\"nm prototyping\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tayden.com/publications/Nanometer%20Prototyping.pdf|title=Nanometer prototyping|last=Rittman|first=Danny|date=2006-01-05|website=Tayden Design|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Reason to debug in FPGA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13550/fpga-prototyping-to-structured-asic-production-to-reduce-cost-risk-ttm.html|title=FPGA Prototyping to Structured ASIC Production to Reduce Cost, Risk & TTM|website=Design And Reuse|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nWith high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems.

Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nFPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system's full operating frequency with real-world stimuli.  Tools such as Certus<ref>Brian Bailey, EE Times. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1317504 Tektronix hopes to shake up ASIC prototyping].\" October 30, 2012. Retrieved July 28, 2015.</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.  This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n\nIn parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of [[logic synthesis]], during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied.  This generates an output known as a [[netlist]] describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections.  These netlists are combined with the [[glue logic]] connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be [[printed circuit board|printed]] onto a chip.  This process is known as [[place and route]] and precedes [[tape-out]] in the event that the SoCs are produced as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASIC).\n\n== Optimization goals ==\nSystems-on-chip must optimize [[Power consumption|power use]], area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], communication, positioning for [[Locality of reference|locality]] between modular units and other factors.  Optimization is necessarily a design goal of systems-on-chip.  If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a [[multi-chip module]] architecture without accounting for the area utilization, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.\n\nCommon optimization targets for system-on-chip designs follow, with explanations of each.  In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, and can indeed be [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] fairly easily.  Therefore, sophisticated [[optimization algorithm]]s are often required and it may be practical to use [[approximation algorithm]]s or [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] in some cases.  Additionally, most SoC designs contain [[Multivariate optimization|multiple variables to optimize simultaneously]], so [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] solutions are sought after in SoC design.  Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of systems-on-chip and introducing [[Trade-off#Engineering|trade-offs]] in system design.\n\nFor broader coverage of trade-offs and [[requirements analysis]], see [[requirements engineering]].\n\n=== Targets ===\n\n==== Power consumption ====\nSystems-on-chip are optimized to minimize the [[Electric power#Definition|electrical power]] used to perform the SoC's functions.  Most SoCs must use low power.  SoC systems often require long [[battery life]] (such as [[smartphone]]s), can potentially spending months or years without a power source needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of [[Embedded system|embedded]] SoCs being [[Distributed computing|networked together]] in an area.  Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the [[total cost of ownership]] of the SoC.  Finally, [[waste heat]] from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy.  The amount of [[energy]] used in a circuit is the [[integral]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] consumed with respect to time, and the [[Mean value theorem|average rate]] of power consumption is the product of [[Electric current|current]] by [[voltage]].  Equivalently, by [[Ohm's law]], power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by [[Resistance (physics)|resistance]]:\n\n<math display=\"block\">P = IV = \\frac{V^2}{R} = {I^2}{R}</math>Systems-on-chip are frequently embedded in [[Mobile device|portable devices]] such as [[smartphones]], [[GPS navigation device]]s, digital [[Digital watch|watches]] (including [[smartwatch]]es) and [[netbook]]s.  Customers want long battery lives for [[mobile computing]] devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in systems-on-chip. [[Multimedia application]]s are often executed on these devices, including [[video game]]s, [[video streaming]], [[image processing]]; all of which have grown in [[computational complexity]] in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-[[Video quality|quality]] multimedia.  Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards [[3D video]] at [[high resolution]] with [[List of video compression formats|multiple standards]], so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n==== Performance per watt ====\n{{See also|Green computing}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize [[power efficiency]] in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage.  Many applications such as [[edge computing]], [[distributed processing]] and [[ambient intelligence]] require a certain level of [[Computer performance|computational performance]], but power is limited in most SoC environments.  The [[ARM architecture]] has greater performance per watt than [[x86]] in embedded systems, so it is preferred over x86 for most SoC applications requiring an [[Soft microprocessor|embedded processor]].\n\n==== Waste heat ====\n{{Main|Heat generation in integrated circuits}}{{See also|Thermal management (electronics)|Thermal design power|label 1=Thermal management in electronics}}\nSoC designs are optimized to minimize [[waste heat]] [[dissipation|output]] on the chip.  As with other [[integrated circuit]]s, heat generated due to high [[power density]] are the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] to further [[miniaturization]] of components.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Heat Management in Integrated circuits: On-chip and system-level monitoring and cooling|last=Ogrenci-Memik|first=Seda|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2015|isbn=9781849199353|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=|oclc=934678500}}</ref>{{Rp|1}}  The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven.  Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] of the circuit over time.  High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact reliability, [[stress migration]], decreased [[mean time between failures]], [[electromigration]], [[wire bonding]], [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]] and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2\u20139}}\n\nIn particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system.  Because of high [[transistor count]]s on modern devices due to [[Moore's law]], oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high [[Transistors density|transistor density]] is physically realizable from [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]] but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit's volume.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\nThese thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative [[design margin]]s, creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of [[catastrophic failure]].  Due to increased [[Transistors density|transistor densities]] as length scales get smaller, each [[Semiconductor node|process generation]] produces more heat output than the last.  Compounding this problem, system-on-chip architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous [[heat flux]]es, which cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform [[passive cooling]].<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|1}}\n\n==== Throughput ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications [[throughput]].\n\n==== Latency ====\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoCs are optimized to minimize [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for some or all of their functions.  This can be accomplished by [[Integrated circuit layout|laying out]] elements with proper proximity and [[Locality of reference|locality]] to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, [[Execution unit|functional units]] and memories.  In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] problem equivalent to the [[boolean satisfiability problem]].\n\nFor [[Task (computing)|tasks]] running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with [[Scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]].  Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.\n\n=== Methodologies ===\n{{Further|Multi-objective optimization|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Architecture tradeoff analysis method|label3=Architecture tradeoff analysis}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}\nSystems on chip are modeled with standard hardware [[verification and validation]] techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] on the above optimization targets.\n\n==== Task scheduling ====\n[[Scheduling (computing)|Task scheduling]] is an important activity in any computer system with multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] sharing a single processor core.  It is important to reduce {{Section link||Latency|nopage=y}} and increase {{Section link||Throughput|nopage=y}} for [[embedded software]] running on an SoC's {{Section link||Processor cores|nopage=y}}.  Not every important computing activity in a system-on-chip is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving [[shared resource]]s.\n\nSoCs often schedule tasks according to [[network scheduling]] and [[Stochastic scheduling|randomized scheduling]] algorithms.\n\n==== Pipelining ====\n{{Broader|Pipeline (computing)}}\nHardware and software tasks are often pipelined in [[processor design]].  Pipelining is an important principle for [[speedup]] in [[computer architecture]].  They are frequently used in [[GPU]]s ([[graphics pipeline]]) and RISC processors (evolutions of the [[classic RISC pipeline]]), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia manipulations in the context of systems-on-chip.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Probabilistic modeling ====\nSystems-on-chip are often analyzed though [[probabilistic model]]s, {{Section link|Queueing theory|Queueing networks}} and [[Markov chain]]s.  For instance, [[Little's law]] allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through [[Poisson random variable]]s and [[Poisson process]]es.\n\n==== Markov chains ====\nSoCs are often modeled with [[Markov chain]]s, both [[Markov chain#Discrete-time Markov chain|discrete time]] and [[Markov chain#Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time]] variants.  Markov chain modeling allows [[asymptotic analysis]] of the system-on-chip's [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|steady state distribution]] of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.\n\n== Fabrication ==\n{{Ref improve section|date=March 2017}}{{See|Semiconductor device fabrication}}\n\nSoC chips are typically [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] using [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lin |first1=Youn-Long Steve |title=Essential Issues in SOC Design: Designing Complex Systems-on-Chip |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781402053528 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OV9lEn9LiQC&pg=PA176}}</ref> The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design ([[place and route]]) flow to convert the designers' intent into the design of the SoC.  Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.\n\nWhen all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched.  These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.\n\nSoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:\n\n* [[Full custom]] ASIC\n* [[Standard cell]] ASIC\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\nASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://numato.com/blog/differences-between-fpga-and-asics/|title=FPGA vs ASIC: Differences between them and which one to use? \u2013 Numato Lab Help Center|website=numato.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n\nSoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.\n\nHowever, like most [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) designs, the total cost{{Clarify|reason=what kind of cost?|date=May 2018}} is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|lower yields]]{{Clarify|reason=confusing to non-experts|date=May 2018}} and higher [[non-recurring engineering]] costs.\n\nWhen it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a [[system in package]] (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single [[chip carrier|package]].  When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler.<ref>[[EE Times]]. \"[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1153043 The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP].\" March 21, 2005. Retrieved July 28, 2015.</ref> Another reason SiP may be preferred is [[waste heat]] may be too high in a system-on-chip for a given purpose because functional components are too close together, and in an SiP heat will dissipate better from different functional modules since they are physically further apart.\n\n== Benchmarks ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\nSoC [[research and development]] often compares many options.  Benchmarks, such as COSMIC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ece.ust.hk/~eexu/COSMIC.html|title=COSMIC|website=www.ece.ust.hk|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> are developed to help such evaluations.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of system-on-a-chip suppliers]]\n* [[Post-silicon validation]]\n* [[ARM architecture]]\n* [[Single-board computer]]\n* [[System in package]]\n* [[Network on a chip]]\n* [[Programmable system-on-chip]]\n* [[Application-specific instruction set processor]] (ASIP)\n* [[Platform-based design]]\n* [[Lab on a chip]]\n* [[Organ on a chip]] in biomedical technology\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |editor1-first=Wael |editor1-last=Badawy |authorlink1=Wael Badawy |editor2-first=Graham A. |editor2-last=Jullien |authorlink2=Graham Jullien |year=2003 |title=System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications |series=Kluwer international series in engineering and computer science, SECS 711 |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |location=Boston |isbn=9781402072543 |oclc=50478525 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ha76NqrqPVIC}} 465 pages.\n* {{cite book |author=Furber, Stephen B. |title=ARM system-on-chip architecture |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2000 |isbn=0-201-67519-6 |title-link=ARM system-on-chip architecture }}\n*{{Cite book|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Follow [[WP:EL]] guidelines before adding anything to this section -->\n* [http://www.ieee-socc.org/ SOCC] Annual [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] International SOC Conference\n* [http://www.edautils.com/Baya.html Baya] free SoC platform assembly and IP integration tool\n*[http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~nelson/courses/elec5260_6260/Systems%20on%20Chip%20(SoC).pdf Systems on Chip for Embedded Applications], [[Auburn University]] seminar in [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]]\n* [http://www.fpga-cores.com/instant-soc/ Instant SoC] SoC for FPGAs defined by C++\n{{Systems on chip}}{{CPU technologies}}\n{{Single-board computer}}\n{{Programmable Logic}}\n{{Computer science}}\n{{Hardware acceleration}}\n\n[[Category:Computer engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Microtechnology]]\n[[Category:System on a chip| ]]\n[[Category:Hardware acceleration]]\n[[Category:Computer systems]]\n[[Category:Application-specific integrated circuits]]\n", "name_user": "SUM1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Capitalisation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}
