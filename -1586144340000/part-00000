Date: 1874]]\nExamination of remains of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' from [[Kenya]], that are about 1.6 million years old, has revealed signs typical of yaws. The genetic analysis of the yaws' causative bacteria\u2014''Treponema pallidum pertenue''\u2014has led to the conclusion that yaws is the most ancient of the four known ''Treponema'' diseases. All other ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies probably evolved from ''Treponema pallidum pertenue''. Yaws is believed to have originated in tropical areas of Africa, and spread to other tropical areas of the world via immigration and the [[slave trade]]. The latter is likely the way it was introduced to [[Europe]] from [[Africa]] in the 15th century. The first unambiguous description of yaws was made by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physician [[Willem Piso]]. Yaws was clearly described in 1679 among [[African slaves]] by [[Thomas Sydenham]] in his [[epistle]] on [[venereal diseases]], although he thought that it was the same disease as [[syphilis]]. The causative agent of yaws was discovered in 1905 by [[Aldo Castellani]] in ulcers of patients from [[Ceylon]].<ref name=Mit2013/>\n\nThe current English name is believed to be of [[Island Caribs|Carib]] origin, from \"yaya\", meaning sore.<ref name=MedicineNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/yaws/page4.htm|title=Yaws|accessdate=5 August 2012|vauthors=Davis CP, Stoppler MC|publisher=MedicineNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008223230/http://www.medicinenet.com/yaws/page4.htm|archivedate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Eradication===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Europeaan vaccineert Indonesische pati\u00ebnten met neosalvarsaan tegen de ziekte framboesia TMnr 10006691.jpg|250px|thumb|European doctor treats an Indonesian woman for yaws, mid-20th-century.<!--no date on photo, but film processing method pretty much eliminates the late 20th and 21st century.

It was one of the first diseases targeted by the WHO after the organization was formed in 1948. The first effort was from 1952 to 1964, by the WHO and the [[United Nations Children\u2019s Fund|UNICEF]]. It reduced the number of cases to 5% of the former burden, from 50 million cases to 2.5 million. Attempts to integrate yaws eradication into the primary healthcare system in the late 1960s failed, and by the 1970s, yaws was making a comeback in many countries. Weak control efforts were made in the late 70s and mid-80s. In 1995, the WHO estimated 460 000 worldwide cases. With few cases, mainly affecting poor, remote communities with little access to treatment, yaws became poorly-known, yaws knowledge and skills died out even among health professionals, and yaws eradication was not seen as a high priority. Many eradication campaigns ended in complacency and neglect; even in areas where transmission was successfully interrupted, re-introduction from infected areas occurred.

All other ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies probably evolved from ''Treponema pallidum pertenue''. Yaws is believed to have originated in tropical areas of Africa, and spread to other tropical areas of the world via immigration and the [[slave trade]].

It was one of the first diseases targeted by the WHO after the organization was formed in 1948. The first effort was from 1952 to 1964, by the WHO and the [[United Nations Children\u2019s Fund|UNICEF]]. It reduced the number of cases to 5% of the former burden, from 50 million cases to 2.5 million. Attempts to integrate yaws eradication into the primary healthcare system in the late 1960s failed, and by the 1970s, yaws was making a comeback in many countries. Weak control efforts were made in the late 70s and mid-80s. In 1995, the WHO estimated 460 000 worldwide cases. With few cases, mainly affecting poor, remote communities with little access to treatment, yaws became poorly-known, yaws knowledge and skills died out even among health professionals, and yaws eradication was not seen as a high priority. Many eradication campaigns ended in complacency and neglect; even in areas where transmission was successfully interrupted, re-introduction from infected areas occurred.

In English translation, he is usually referred to as '''Quintilian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u026a|l|i|\u0259n}}), although the alternate spellings of '''Quintillian''' and '''Quinctilian''' are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.\n\n==Life==\nQuintilian was born c. 35 in ''Calagurris'' ([[Calahorra]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) in [[Hispania]]. His father, a well-educated man, sent him to Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of [[Nero]]. While there, he cultivated a relationship with [[Domitius Afer]], who died in 59. \"It had always been the custom \u2026 for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition \u2026 and regard him as a mentor\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=16}}. Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and listened to him speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of [[Seneca the Younger]], and he may have inspired Quintilian's love of [[Cicero]].\n\nSometime after Afer's death, Quintilian returned to Hispania, possibly to practice law in the courts of his own province. However, in 68, he returned to Rome as part of the retinue of Emperor [[Galba]], Nero's short-lived successor. Quintilian does not appear to have been a close advisor of the Emperor, which probably ensured his survival after the assassination of Galba in 69.\n\nAfter Galba's death, and during the chaotic [[Year of the Four Emperors]] which followed, Quintilian opened a public school of [[rhetoric]]. Among his students were [[Pliny the Younger]], and perhaps [[Tacitus]]. The Emperor [[Vespasian]] made him a ''[[Roman consul|consul]].'' The emperor \"in general was not especially interested in the arts, but \u2026 was interested in education as a means of creating an intelligent and responsible ruling class\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=19}}. This subsidy enabled Quintilian to devote more time to the school, since it freed him of pressing monetary concerns. In addition, he appeared in the courts of law, arguing on behalf of clients.\n\nOf his personal life, little is known. In the ''Institutio Oratoria'', he mentions a wife who died young, as well as two sons who predeceased him.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nQuintilian retired from teaching and pleading in 88 {{harv|Reid|1911}}, during the reign of [[Domitian]]. His retirement may have been prompted by his achievement of financial security and his desire to become a gentleman of leisure. Quintilian survived several emperors; the reigns of Vespasian and [[Titus]] were relatively peaceful, but that of Domitian was reputed to be difficult. Domitian's cruelty and paranoia may have prompted the rhetorician to distance himself quietly. The emperor does not appear to have taken offence as he made Quintilian tutor of his two grand-nephews in 90 AD.  He is believed to have died sometime around 100, not having long survived Domitian, who was assassinated in 96 {{harv|Quintilianus|2016|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}.\n\n==Works==\nThe only extant work of Quintilian is a twelve-volume textbook on rhetoric entitled ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (generally referred to in English as the ''Institutes of Oratory''), published around AD 95. This work deals not only with the theory and practice of rhetoric, but also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself, providing advice that ran from the cradle to the grave. An earlier text, ''De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae'' (\"On the Causes of Corrupted Eloquence\") has been lost, but is believed to have been \"a preliminary exposition of some of the views later set forth in [''Institutio Oratoria'']\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=24}}.\n\nIn addition, there are two sets of declamations, ''Declamationes Maiores'' and ''Declamationes Minores'', which have been attributed to Quintilian. However, there is some dispute over the real writer of these texts: \"Some modern scholars believe that the declamations circulated in his name represent the lecture notes of a scholar either using Quintilian's system or actually trained by him\" {{harv|Murphy|loc=XVII\u2013XVIII}}.\n\n==''Institutio Oratoria''==\n{{main|Institutio Oratoria}}\n[[File:Quintilian, Institutio oratoria ed. Burman (Leiden 1720), frontispiece.jpg|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of a 1720 edition of the ''Institutio Oratoria'', showing Quintilan teaching rhetoric]]\n\n''Institutio Oratoria'' (English: ''Institutes of Oratory'') is a twelve-volume textbook on the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] by Roman rhetorician Quintilian. It was published around year 95 AD. The work deals also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself. In this work, Quintilian establishes that the perfect orator is first a good man, and after that he is a good speaker {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He also believed that a speech should stay genuine to a message that is \"just and honorable\" {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. Coherently, this came to be known as his good man theory, embracing the message that if one cannot be genuinely good, then one cannot be a good speaker for the people. This theory also revolves around being of service to the people. A good man is one who works for the good of the people and the prosperity of society.\n\nQuintilian published ''Institutio Oratoria'' in the last years of [[Domitian]]\u2019s rule of the empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He had worked alongside Domitian, but as he began to write more and ease away from Emperor Domitian\u2019s complete power, the emperor did not seem to mind as he was so impressed with Quintilian, he hired him to be a tutor for his family because of Quintilian\u2019s devotion to education. Domitian was in the harshest period of his rule, and almost no one had the courage to speak any idea that was unlike his, but Quintilian did {{harv|Gideon}}. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of [[Augustus]] {{harv|Gideon}}. Rather than pleading cases, as an orator of his era might have been expected to do, he concentrated on speaking in more general terms about how sound rhetoric influences the education of the people.\n\n== Placement of Quintilian's rhetoric ==\n\nQuintilian cites many authors in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' before providing his own definition of [[rhetoric]] {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.3}}. His rhetoric is chiefly defined by [[Cato the Elder]]\u2019s ''vir bonus, dicendi peritus'', or \u201cthe good man skilled at speaking\u201d {{harv|Quintilian|loc=12.1.1}}. Later he states: \u201cI should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=12.2.7}}. Quintilian also \u201cinsists that his ideal orator is no philosopher because the philosopher does not take as a duty participation in civic life; this is constitutive of Quintilian's (and [[Isocrates]]' and [[Cicero]]'s) ideal orator\" {{harv|Walzer|loc=26}}. Though he calls for [[Dionysian imitatio|imitation]], he also urges the orator to use this knowledge to inspire his own original invention {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.2.4}}.\n\nNo author receives greater praise in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' than Cicero: \"For who can instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a gift of charm?\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.110}}. Quintilian's definition of rhetoric shares many similarities with that of Cicero, one being the importance of the speaker's moral character {{harv|Logie|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2017}}}}. Like Cicero, Quintilian also believes that \u201chistory and philosophy can increase an orator\u2019s command of ''copia'' and style;\" they differ in that Quintilian \u201cfeatures the character of the orator, as well as the art\u201d {{harv|Walzer|loc=36\u201337}}.\n\nIn Book II, Quintilian sides with [[Plato]]\u2019s assertion in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' that the rhetorician must be just: \u201cIn the ''Phaedrus'', Plato makes it even clearer that the complete attainment of this art is even impossible without the knowledge of justice, an opinion in which I heartily concur\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc= 2.15.29}}. Their views are further similar in their treatment of \u201c(1) the inseparability, in more respects than one, of wisdom, goodness, and eloquence; and (2) the morally ideological nature of rhetoric. [...] For both, there are conceptual connections between rhetoric and justice which rule out the possibility of [an] amorally neutral conception of rhetoric. For both, rhetoric is \u2018speaking well,\u2019 and for both \u2018speaking well\u2019 means speaking justly\" {{harv|Logie|loc=371}}.\n\n==Influence of Quintilian==\nThe influence of Quintilian's masterwork, ''Institutio Oratoria'', can be felt in several areas. First of all, there is his criticism of the orator [[Seneca the Younger]]. Quintilian was attempting to modify the prevailing imperial style of oratory with his book, and Seneca was the principal figure in that style's tradition. He was more recent than many of the authors mentioned by Quintilian, but his reputation within the post-classical style necessitated both his mention and the criticism or back-handed praise that is given to him. Quintilian believed that \u201chis style is for the most part corrupt and extremely dangerous because it abounds in attractive faults\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.129}}. Seneca was regarded as doubly dangerous because his style was sometimes attractive. This reading of Seneca \u201chas heavily coloured subsequent judgments of Seneca and his style\" {{harv|Dominik|loc=51}}.\n\nQuintilian also made an impression on [[Martial]], the Latin poet. A short poem, published in 86, was addressed to him, and opened, \"Quintilian, greatest director of straying youth, / you are an honour, Quintilian, to the Roman toga\". However, one should not take Martial's praise at face value, since he was known for his sly and witty insults. The opening lines are all that are usually quoted, but the rest of the poem contains lines such as \"A man who longs to surpass his father\u2019s census rating\" (6).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} This speaks of Quintilian's ambitious side and his drive for wealth and position.\n\nAfter his death, Quintilian's influence fluctuated. He was mentioned by his pupil, Pliny, and by [[Juvenal]], who may have been another student, \u201cas an example of sobriety and of worldly success unusual in the teaching profession\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=139}}. During the 3rd to 5th centuries, his influence was felt among such authors as [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], whose discussion of signs and figurative language certainly owed something to Quintilian, and to [[St. Jerome]], editor of the [[Vulgate Bible]], whose theories on education are clearly influenced by Quintilian's. The [[Middle Ages]] saw a decline in knowledge of his work, since existing manuscripts of ''Institutio Oratoria'' were fragmented, but the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] revived interest in the work after the discovery by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] in 1416 of a forgotten, complete manuscript in the monastery of [[St. Gall]], which he found \"buried in rubbish and dust\" in a filthy dungeon. The influential scholar [[Leonardo Bruni]], considered the first modern historian, greeted the news by writing to his friend Poggio: <blockquote>\nIt will be your glory to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero's dissertation ''De Republica.'' {{harv|Shepherd|loc=chapter 3, pp. 95\u201397}}</blockquote>The Italian poet [[Petrarch]] addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he \u201cprovided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Martin Luther]], the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, \"claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, 'in that he educates and at the same time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and in deed most happily'\" {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. The influence of Quintilian's works is also seen in Luther's contemporary [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.\n\nIt has been argued by a musicologist, Ursula {{harvtxt|Kirkendale|loc=Page needed}} that the composition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Das Musikalische Opfer'' ([[The Musical Offering]], BWV 1079), was closely connected with the ''Institutio Oratoria''. Among Bach's duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723\u20131750) was teaching Latin; his early training included rhetoric. (Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, [[Johann Matthias Gesner]], for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach's honor.)\n\nAfter this high point, Quintilian's influence seems to have lessened somewhat, although he is mentioned by the English poet [[Alexander Pope]] in his versified ''An Essay on Criticism'':\n\n<blockquote><poem>In grave Quintilian\u2019s copious works we find\nThe justest rules and clearest method join\u2019d (lines 669\u201370).</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, \u201che is often mentioned by writers like [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]... but he made no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140\u201341}}. However, in his celebrated ''Autobiography,'' [[John Stuart Mill]] (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to \"his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up,\" was \"seldom sufficiently appreciated.\" \"His book,\" Mill continued, \"is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him...\" {{harv|Mill|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He was also highly praised by [[Thomas De Quincey]]: \"[F]or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson on the possibility of imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian\" {{harv|De Quincey|loc=40}}. In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and is an integral part of the history of education. He is believed to be the \"earliest spokesman for a child-centered education\" (141),{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} which is discussed above under his [[early childhood education]] theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system.

In English translation, he is usually referred to as '''Quintilian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u026a|l|i|\u0259n}}), although the alternate spellings of '''Quintillian''' and '''Quinctilian''' are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.\n\n==Life==\nQuintilian was born c. 35 in ''Calagurris'' ([[Calahorra]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) in [[Hispania]]. His father, a well-educated man, sent him to Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of [[Nero]]. While there, he cultivated a relationship with [[Domitius Afer]], who died in 59. \"It had always been the custom \u2026 for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition \u2026 and regard him as a mentor\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=16}}. Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and listened to him speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of [[Seneca the Younger]], and he may have inspired Quintilian's love of [[Cicero]].\n\nSometime after Afer's death, Quintilian returned to Hispania, possibly to practice law in the courts of his own province. However, in 68, he returned to Rome as part of the retinue of Emperor [[Galba]], Nero's short-lived successor. Quintilian does not appear to have been a close advisor of the Emperor, which probably ensured his survival after the assassination of Galba in 69.\n\nAfter Galba's death, and during the chaotic [[Year of the Four Emperors]] which followed, Quintilian opened a public school of [[rhetoric]]. Among his students were [[Pliny the Younger]], and perhaps [[Tacitus]]. The Emperor [[Vespasian]] made him a ''[[Roman consul|consul]].'' The emperor \"in general was not especially interested in the arts, but \u2026 was interested in education as a means of creating an intelligent and responsible ruling class\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=19}}. This subsidy enabled Quintilian to devote more time to the school, since it freed him of pressing monetary concerns. In addition, he appeared in the courts of law, arguing on behalf of clients.\n\nOf his personal life, little is known. In the ''Institutio Oratoria'', he mentions a wife who died young, as well as two sons who predeceased him.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nQuintilian retired from teaching and pleading in 88 {{harv|Reid|1911}}, during the reign of [[Domitian]]. His retirement may have been prompted by his achievement of financial security and his desire to become a gentleman of leisure. Quintilian survived several emperors; the reigns of Vespasian and [[Titus]] were relatively peaceful, but that of Domitian was reputed to be difficult. Domitian's cruelty and paranoia may have prompted the rhetorician to distance himself quietly. The emperor does not appear to have taken offence as he made Quintilian tutor of his two grand-nephews in 90 AD.  He is believed to have died sometime around 100, not having long survived Domitian, who was assassinated in 96 {{harv|Quintilianus|2016|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}.\n\n==Works==\nThe only extant work of Quintilian is a twelve-volume textbook on rhetoric entitled ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (generally referred to in English as the ''Institutes of Oratory''), published around AD 95. This work deals not only with the theory and practice of rhetoric, but also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself, providing advice that ran from the cradle to the grave. An earlier text, ''De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae'' (\"On the Causes of Corrupted Eloquence\") has been lost, but is believed to have been \"a preliminary exposition of some of the views later set forth in [''Institutio Oratoria'']\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=24}}.\n\nIn addition, there are two sets of declamations, ''Declamationes Maiores'' and ''Declamationes Minores'', which have been attributed to Quintilian. However, there is some dispute over the real writer of these texts: \"Some modern scholars believe that the declamations circulated in his name represent the lecture notes of a scholar either using Quintilian's system or actually trained by him\" {{harv|Murphy|loc=XVII\u2013XVIII}}.\n\n==''Institutio Oratoria''==\n{{main|Institutio Oratoria}}\n[[File:Quintilian, Institutio oratoria ed. Burman (Leiden 1720), frontispiece.jpg|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of a 1720 edition of the ''Institutio Oratoria'', showing Quintilan teaching rhetoric]]\n\n''Institutio Oratoria'' (English: ''Institutes of Oratory'') is a twelve-volume textbook on the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] by Roman rhetorician Quintilian. It was published around year 95 AD. The work deals also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself. In this work, Quintilian establishes that the perfect orator is first a good man, and after that he is a good speaker {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He also believed that a speech should stay genuine to a message that is \"just and honorable\" {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. Coherently, this came to be known as his good man theory, embracing the message that if one cannot be genuinely good, then one cannot be a good speaker for the people. This theory also revolves around being of service to the people. A good man is one who works for the good of the people and the prosperity of society.\n\nQuintilian published ''Institutio Oratoria'' in the last years of [[Domitian]]\u2019s rule of the empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He had worked alongside Domitian, but as he began to write more and ease away from Emperor Domitian\u2019s complete power, the emperor did not seem to mind as he was so impressed with Quintilian, he hired him to be a tutor for his family because of Quintilian\u2019s devotion to education. Domitian was in the harshest period of his rule, and almost no one had the courage to speak any idea that was unlike his, but Quintilian did {{harv|Gideon}}. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of [[Augustus]] {{harv|Gideon}}. Rather than pleading cases, as an orator of his era might have been expected to do, he concentrated on speaking in more general terms about how sound rhetoric influences the education of the people.\n\n== Placement of Quintilian's rhetoric ==\n\nQuintilian cites many authors in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' before providing his own definition of [[rhetoric]] {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.3}}. His rhetoric is chiefly defined by [[Cato the Elder]]\u2019s ''vir bonus, dicendi peritus'', or \u201cthe good man skilled at speaking\u201d {{harv|Quintilian|loc=12.1.1}}. Later he states: \u201cI should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=12.2.7}}. Quintilian also \u201cinsists that his ideal orator is no philosopher because the philosopher does not take as a duty participation in civic life; this is constitutive of Quintilian's (and [[Isocrates]]' and [[Cicero]]'s) ideal orator\" {{harv|Walzer|loc=26}}. Though he calls for [[Dionysian imitatio|imitation]], he also urges the orator to use this knowledge to inspire his own original invention {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.2.4}}.\n\nNo author receives greater praise in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' than Cicero: \"For who can instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a gift of charm?\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.110}}. Quintilian's definition of rhetoric shares many similarities with that of Cicero, one being the importance of the speaker's moral character {{harv|Logie|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2017}}}}. Like Cicero, Quintilian also believes that \u201chistory and philosophy can increase an orator\u2019s command of ''copia'' and style;\" they differ in that Quintilian \u201cfeatures the character of the orator, as well as the art\u201d {{harv|Walzer|loc=36\u201337}}.\n\nIn Book II, Quintilian sides with [[Plato]]\u2019s assertion in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' that the rhetorician must be just: \u201cIn the ''Phaedrus'', Plato makes it even clearer that the complete attainment of this art is even impossible without the knowledge of justice, an opinion in which I heartily concur\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc= 2.15.29}}. Their views are further similar in their treatment of \u201c(1) the inseparability, in more respects than one, of wisdom, goodness, and eloquence; and (2) the morally ideological nature of rhetoric. [...] For both, there are conceptual connections between rhetoric and justice which rule out the possibility of [an] amorally neutral conception of rhetoric. For both, rhetoric is \u2018speaking well,\u2019 and for both \u2018speaking well\u2019 means speaking justly\" {{harv|Logie|loc=371}}.\n\n==Influence of Quintilian==\nThe influence of Quintilian's masterwork, ''Institutio Oratoria'', can be felt in several areas. First of all, there is his criticism of the orator [[Seneca the Younger]]. Quintilian was attempting to modify the prevailing imperial style of oratory with his book, and Seneca was the principal figure in that style's tradition. He was more recent than many of the authors mentioned by Quintilian, but his reputation within the post-classical style necessitated both his mention and the criticism or back-handed praise that is given to him. Quintilian believed that \u201chis style is for the most part corrupt and extremely dangerous because it abounds in attractive faults\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.129}}. Seneca was regarded as doubly dangerous because his style was sometimes attractive. This reading of Seneca \u201chas heavily coloured subsequent judgments of Seneca and his style\" {{harv|Dominik|loc=51}}.\n\nQuintilian also made an impression on [[Martial]], the Latin poet. A short poem, published in 86, was addressed to him, and opened, \"Quintilian, greatest director of straying youth, / you are an honour, Quintilian, to the Roman toga\". However, one should not take Martial's praise at face value, since he was known for his sly and witty insults. The opening lines are all that are usually quoted, but the rest of the poem contains lines such as \"A man who longs to surpass his father\u2019s census rating\" (6).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} This speaks of Quintilian's ambitious side and his drive for wealth and position.\n\nAfter his death, Quintilian's influence fluctuated. He was mentioned by his pupil, Pliny, and by [[Juvenal]], who may have been another student, \u201cas an example of sobriety and of worldly success unusual in the teaching profession\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=139}}. During the 3rd to 5th centuries, his influence was felt among such authors as [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], whose discussion of signs and figurative language certainly owed something to Quintilian, and to [[St. Jerome]], editor of the [[Vulgate Bible]], whose theories on education are clearly influenced by Quintilian's. The [[Middle Ages]] saw a decline in knowledge of his work, since existing manuscripts of ''Institutio Oratoria'' were fragmented, but the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] revived interest in the work after the discovery by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] in 1416 of a forgotten, complete manuscript in the monastery of [[St. Gall]], which he found \"buried in rubbish and dust\" in a filthy dungeon. The influential scholar [[Leonardo Bruni]], considered the first modern historian, greeted the news by writing to his friend Poggio: <blockquote>\nIt will be your glory to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero's dissertation ''De Republica.'' {{harv|Shepherd|loc=chapter 3, pp. 95\u201397}}</blockquote>The Italian poet [[Petrarch]] addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he \u201cprovided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Martin Luther]], the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, \"claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, 'in that he educates and at the same time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and in deed most happily'\" {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. The influence of Quintilian's works is also seen in Luther's contemporary [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.\n\nIt has been argued by a musicologist, Ursula {{harvtxt|Kirkendale|loc=Page needed}} that the composition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Das Musikalische Opfer'' ([[The Musical Offering]], BWV 1079), was closely connected with the ''Institutio Oratoria''. Among Bach's duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723\u20131750) was teaching Latin; his early training included rhetoric. (Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, [[Johann Matthias Gesner]], for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach's honor.)\n\nAfter this high point, Quintilian's influence seems to have lessened somewhat, although he is mentioned by the English poet [[Alexander Pope]] in his versified ''An Essay on Criticism'':\n\n<blockquote><poem>In grave Quintilian\u2019s copious works we find\nThe justest rules and clearest method join\u2019d (lines 669\u201370).</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, \u201che is often mentioned by writers like [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]... but he made no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140\u201341}}. However, in his celebrated ''Autobiography,'' [[John Stuart Mill]] (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to \"his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up,\" was \"seldom sufficiently appreciated.\" \"His book,\" Mill continued, \"is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him...\" {{harv|Mill|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He was also highly praised by [[Thomas De Quincey]]: \"[F]or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson on the possibility of imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian\" {{harv|De Quincey|loc=40}}. In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and is an integral part of the history of education. He is believed to be the \"earliest spokesman for a child-centered education\" (141),{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} which is discussed above under his [[early childhood education]] theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of [[trope (literature)|tropes]] and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[formalism (literature)|formalist]] theories. For example, the works of [[Jacques Derrida]] on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian's assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes {{harv|Gunderson|loc=38}}.{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=Source does not say that Derrida's works would not be possible without Quintilian, but merely that \"Quintilian reads in a manner that evokes the ideas of Derrida on the problems of reading and writing in Western philosophy.\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quadripartita ratio]]\n* [[Dionysian imitatio]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|De Quincey}}|reference=De Quincey, Thomas.

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin. Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show featured a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"></ref>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\nThe main event of the entire two-night WrestleMania was [[Brock Lesnar]] (with [[Paul Heyman]]) vs. [[Drew McIntyre]] for the [[WWE Championship]]. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"></ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Raw===\n===SmackDown===\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show featured a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

A $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOF {{!}} Singapore Budget 2020 {{!}} Supplementary Budget Statement |url=https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |website=www.singaporebudget.gov.sg |accessdate=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327004758/https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|title=Singapore's 'bazooka' stimulus to cushion COVID-19 pain, but recession still on the cards: Economists|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327072500/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|archive-date=27 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Third stimulus package - \"Solidarity Budget\" ====\nIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a \"Solidarity Budget\" when Parliament returned on 6 April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-heng-swee-keat-solidarity-budget-12611084|title=COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat to announce third round of support measures in new 'Solidarity Budget'|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of [[Chan Chun Sing]] with business people from the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same

A $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOF {{!}} Singapore Budget 2020 {{!}} Supplementary Budget Statement |url=https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |website=www.singaporebudget.gov.sg |accessdate=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327004758/https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|title=Singapore's 'bazooka' stimulus to cushion COVID-19 pain, but recession still on the cards: Economists|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327072500/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|archive-date=27 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Third stimulus package - \"Solidarity Budget\" ====\nIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a \"Solidarity Budget\" when Parliament returned on 6 April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-heng-swee-keat-solidarity-budget-12611084|title=COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat to announce third round of support measures in new 'Solidarity Budget'|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of [[Chan Chun Sing]] with business people from the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304163310/https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|archive-date=4 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227192432/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |archive-date=27 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324094050/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n{{Portal bar|COVID-19|Singapore|Medicine|Viruses}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCancelled", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}
