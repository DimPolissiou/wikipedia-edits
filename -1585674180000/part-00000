The series, which was created as a [[television spin-off|spin-off]] of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' by creator and producer [[Susan Harris (producer)|Susan Harris]], starred [[Richard Mulligan]] as recently widowed [[pediatrician]] Dr. Harry Weston, whose two adult daughters return home to live with him.\n\nFor its first three seasons, ''Empty Nest'' was one of the year's top 10 most-watched programs. It was produced by [[Witt/Thomas Productions|Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions]] in association with [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]].<ref name=Rosenberg>{{cite news|title= 'Empty Nest' Looks Like Good Place to Nestle Down |publisher= LA Times|date=October 8, 1988|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-08/entertainment/ca-3135_1_empty-nest|accessdate=2010-08-23 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= 'Empty Nest': TV's Unknown Hit |publisher= LA Times|date=November 24, 1990|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-24/entertainment/ca-4578_1_empty-nest|accessdate=2010-08-23 | first=Diane | last=Haithman}}</ref>\n\n''Empty Nest'' was part of NBC's Saturday night block of programming, and during its first four seasons it aired at 9:30pm ET, directly following ''The Golden Girls''.\n\n==History==\nAn early version of the series initially appeared in the 1987 ''Golden Girls'' episode \"Empty Nests\" and was intended to act as a [[backdoor pilot]] for the spin-off, which was to begin during the fall 1987 TV season.\n\nIn the episode, George and Renee Corliss (played by [[Paul Dooley]] and [[Rita Moreno]]), were introduced as the Girls' neighbors, a middle-aged couple suffering from [[empty nest syndrome]]. Their teenage daughter Jenny (Jane Harnick), who had left for college, and Renee's brother Chuck ([[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]), also appeared. The Corlisses also had an annoying neighbor played by [[David Leisure]] (although in this version his character was named Oliver). \n\nUltimately, the series did not go ahead as planned and the premise was later extensively revamped with a new cast before ''Empty Nest'' debuted in 1988. The set of the Corlisses' house, however, was exactly the same as the one that later became the Weston residence.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe show revolved around [[pediatrician]] Dr. Harry Weston ([[Richard Mulligan]]), whose life was turned upside down when his wife, Libby ([[Judith-Marie Bergan]]), died and two of his adult daughters moved back into the family home in Miami. Early episodes established that the ''Golden Girls'' characters were neighbors of the Westons. [[Bea Arthur]], [[Rue McClanahan]], [[Betty White]] and [[Estelle Getty]] all guest-starred as their ''Golden Girls'' characters, and Mulligan appeared occasionally on ''The Golden Girls''.\n\nEldest daughter Carol ([[Dinah Manoff]]) was a neurotic, high-strung recent divorc\u00e9e, while middle daughter Barbara ([[Kristy McNichol]]) was a tough undercover police officer. The two sisters frequently bickered and vied for the attention of their father, whom they called \"Daddy.\" (Harry occasionally expressed regret at never having had a son.) The Westons' large dog Dreyfuss was also prominently featured.\n\nIn 1992, McNichol left the show and the youngest Weston daughter, Emily ([[Lisa Rieffel]]), joined the cast. Her character had not been seen before, but had been mentioned as being away at college. Rieffel left after one season, and for the show's final two seasons only Carol remained of the Weston children. McNichol returned for the series finale in 1995.\n\nAnother main character was the Westons' neighbor, Charley Dietz ([[David Leisure]]), a womanizing cruise ship employee who frequently barged into the house unannounced to borrow food or make sexist comments. Charley had a father-son relationship with Harry and a love-hate relationship with Carol.\n\nHarry's job was another major focus for the show. For the first five seasons he worked at a hospital, where he was assisted by wisecracking Southern nurse Laverne ([[Park Overall]]). In season six Harry retired, eventually going to work for a struggling inner-city medical clinic run by the tough-talking Dr. Maxine Douglas ([[Marsha Warfield]]). Laverne, having been fired by Dr. Weston's replacement, came to work there as well.\n\nOther characters who later joined the cast were Carol's boyfriend, Patrick ([[Paul Provenza]]), an artist who was almost as eccentric as she. Patrick convinced the Westons to let him use their empty garage as his new painting studio and, when his relationship with Carol became serious, he eventually moved in altogether. Their romantic bliss was short-lived, as they broke up at the beginning of season six. However, this was not before Carol became pregnant with Patrick's child; their son, Scotty, was born in November 1993, and Carol chose to raise the baby on her own. [[Estelle Getty]] reprised her ''Golden Girls'' character [[Sophia Petrillo]] during ''Empty Nest''{{'}}s final two seasons (after the cancellation of ''[[The Golden Palace]])''. It was explained that Sophia had moved back into the nearby Shady Pines retirement home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Dr. Harry Weston\n* [[Judith-Marie Bergan]] as Libby Weston (1989, 1995)\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Carol Weston\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Barbara Weston (1988\u20131992, 1995)\n* [[David Leisure]] as Charley Dietz\n* [[Park Overall]] as Laverne Todd\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as [[Sophia Petrillo]] (1993\u20131995)\n* [[Paul Provenza]] as Patrick Arcola (1992\u20131993)\n* [[Lisa Rieffel]] as Emily Weston (1993)\n* [[Marsha Warfield]] as Dr. Maxine Douglas (1993\u20131995)\n* Bear the Dog as Dreyfuss the St. Bernard Golden Retriever mix\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n{{col begin|width=40%}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Don Adams]]\n* [[Bea Arthur]]\n* [[Diana Muldaur]]\n* [[Loni Anderson]]\n* [[Mayim Bialik]]\n* [[Eddie Bracken]]\n* [[Garth Brooks]]\n* [[Patricia Crowley]]\n* [[Angie Dickinson]]\n* [[Stephen Dorff]]\n* [[Morgan Fairchild]]\n* [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]\n* [[Marla Gibbs]]\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]]\n* [[Lee Grant]]\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.|Pat Harrington]]\n* [[Phil Hartman]]\n* [[Earl Holliman]]\n* [[Shirley Jones]]\n* [[Gordon Jump]]\n* [[Carol Kane]]\n* [[Joey Lawrence]]\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Jane Lynch]]\n* [[Barbara Mandrell]]\n* [[Rue McClanahan]]\n* [[Audrey Meadows]]\n* [[Edie McClurg]]\n* [[Jerry Orbach]]\n* [[Luke Perry]]\n* [[Matthew Perry]]\n* [[Donnelly Rhodes]]\n* [[Geraldo Rivera]]\n* [[Doris Roberts]]\n* [[Debra Jo Rupp]]\n* [[Jennifer Salt]]\n* [[Peter Scolari]]\n* [[Liz Sheridan]]\n* [[Yeardley Smith]]\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]]\n* [[Adrian Zmed]]\n* [[Harold Gould]]\n* [[Betty White]]\n{{col end}}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n{{Main|List of Empty Nest episodes}}\n{{:List of Empty Nest episodes}}\n\n==Production notes==\nIn 1991, ''Empty Nest'' spawned its own spinoff, ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', a sitcom about a group of nurses working in the same hospital as Dr. Weston. The three series (''Empty Nest'', ''The Golden Girls'' and ''Nurses'') represented one of the few times in American television history that three shows from the same producer, all taking place in the same city and explicitly set up with the characters knowing each other from the very beginning, aired on the same network in one night. On at least two occasions, Harris wrote storylines which carried through all three series as [[fictional crossover]]s.\n\nMulligan and Manoff had previously appeared as father-in-law and daughter-in-law respectively, in the show ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', created by the same production team as ''Empty Nest''.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's theme song was \"Life Goes On\", written by [[John Bettis]] and [[George Tipton]] and performed by [[Billy Vera]]. For the first three seasons, the song was presented in a slower, more melancholy yet comical arrangement.

aired on [[NBC]] from October 8, 1988, to April 29, 1995. The series, which was created as a [[television spin-off|spin-off]] of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' by creator and producer [[Susan Harris (producer)|Susan Harris]], starred [[Richard Mulligan]] as recently widowed [[pediatrician]] Dr. Harry Weston, whose two adult daughters return home to live with him.\n\nFor its first three seasons, ''Empty Nest'' was one of the year's top 10 most-watched programs. It was produced by [[Witt/Thomas Productions|Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions]] in association with [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]].<ref name=Rosenberg>{{cite news|title= 'Empty Nest' Looks Like Good Place to Nestle Down |publisher= LA Times|date=October 8, 1988|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-08/entertainment/ca-3135_1_empty-nest|accessdate=2010-08-23 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= 'Empty Nest': TV's Unknown Hit |publisher= LA Times|date=November 24, 1990|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-24/entertainment/ca-4578_1_empty-nest|accessdate=2010-08-23 | first=Diane | last=Haithman}}</ref>\n\n''Empty Nest'' was part of NBC's Saturday night block of programming, and during its first four seasons it aired at 9:30pm ET, directly following ''The Golden Girls''.\n\n==History==\nAn early version of the series initially appeared in the 1987 ''Golden Girls'' episode \"Empty Nests\" and was intended to act as a [[backdoor pilot]] for the spin-off, which was to begin during the fall 1987 TV season.\n\nIn the episode, George and Renee Corliss (played by [[Paul Dooley]] and [[Rita Moreno]]), were introduced as the Girls' neighbors, a middle-aged couple suffering from [[empty nest syndrome]]. Their teenage daughter Jenny (Jane Harnick), who had left for college, and Renee's brother Chuck ([[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]), also appeared. The Corlisses also had an annoying neighbor played by [[David Leisure]] (although in this version his character was named Oliver). \n\nUltimately, the series did not go ahead as planned and the premise was later extensively revamped with a new cast before ''Empty Nest'' debuted in 1988. The set of the Corlisses' house, however, was exactly the same as the one that later became the Weston residence.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe show revolved around [[pediatrician]] Dr. Harry Weston ([[Richard Mulligan]]), whose life was turned upside down when his wife, Libby ([[Judith-Marie Bergan]]), died and two of his adult daughters moved back into the family home in Miami. Early episodes established that the Golden Girls were neighbors of the Westons. [[Bea Arthur]], [[Rue McClanahan]], [[Betty White]] and [[Estelle Getty]] all guest-starred as their ''Golden Girls'' characters, and Mulligan appeared occasionally on ''The Golden Girls''.\n\nEldest daughter Carol ([[Dinah Manoff]]) was a neurotic, high-strung recent divorc\u00e9e, while middle daughter Barbara ([[Kristy McNichol]]) was a tough undercover police officer. The two sisters frequently bickered and vied for the attention of their father, whom they called \"Daddy.\" (Harry occasionally expressed regret at never having had a son.) The Westons' large dog Dreyfuss was also prominently featured.\n\nIn 1992, McNichol left the show and the youngest Weston daughter, Emily ([[Lisa Rieffel]]), joined the cast. Her character had not been seen before, but had been mentioned as being away at college. Rieffel left after one season, and for the show's final two seasons only Carol remained of the Weston children. McNichol returned for the series finale in 1995.\n\nAnother main character was the Westons' neighbor, Charley Dietz ([[David Leisure]]), a womanizing cruise ship employee who frequently barged into the house unannounced to borrow food or make sexist comments. Charley had a father-son relationship with Harry and a love-hate relationship with Carol.\n\nHarry's job was another major focus for the show. For the first five seasons he worked at a hospital, where he was assisted by wisecracking Southern nurse Laverne ([[Park Overall]]). In season six Harry retired, eventually going to work for a struggling inner-city medical clinic run by the tough-talking Dr. Maxine Douglas ([[Marsha Warfield]]). Laverne, having been fired by Dr. Weston's replacement, came to work there as well.\n\nOther characters who later joined the cast were Carol's boyfriend, Patrick ([[Paul Provenza]]), an artist who was almost as eccentric as she. Patrick convinced the Westons to let him use their empty garage as his new painting studio and, when his relationship with Carol became serious, he eventually moved in altogether. Their romantic bliss was short-lived, as they broke up at the beginning of season six. However, this was not before Carol became pregnant with Patrick's child; their son, Scotty, was born in November 1993, and Carol chose to raise the baby on her own. [[Estelle Getty]] reprised her ''Golden Girls'' character [[Sophia Petrillo]] during ''Empty Nest''{{'}}s final two seasons (after the cancellation of ''[[The Golden Palace]])''. It was explained that Sophia had moved back into the nearby Shady Pines retirement home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Dr. Harry Weston\n* [[Judith-Marie Bergan]] as Libby Weston (1989, 1995)\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Carol Weston\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Barbara Weston (1988\u20131992, 1995)\n* [[David Leisure]] as Charley Dietz\n* [[Park Overall]] as Laverne Todd\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as [[Sophia Petrillo]] (1993\u20131995)\n* [[Paul Provenza]] as Patrick Arcola (1992\u20131993)\n* [[Lisa Rieffel]] as Emily Weston (1993)\n* [[Marsha Warfield]] as Dr. Maxine Douglas (1993\u20131995)\n* Bear the Dog as Dreyfuss the St. Bernard Golden Retriever mix\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n{{col begin|width=40%}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Don Adams]]\n* [[Bea Arthur]]\n* [[Diana Muldaur]]\n* [[Loni Anderson]]\n* [[Mayim Bialik]]\n* [[Eddie Bracken]]\n* [[Garth Brooks]]\n* [[Patricia Crowley]]\n* [[Angie Dickinson]]\n* [[Stephen Dorff]]\n* [[Morgan Fairchild]]\n* [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]\n* [[Marla Gibbs]]\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]]\n* [[Lee Grant]]\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.|Pat Harrington]]\n* [[Phil Hartman]]\n* [[Earl Holliman]]\n* [[Shirley Jones]]\n* [[Gordon Jump]]\n* [[Carol Kane]]\n* [[Joey Lawrence]]\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Jane Lynch]]\n* [[Barbara Mandrell]]\n* [[Rue McClanahan]]\n* [[Audrey Meadows]]\n* [[Edie McClurg]]\n* [[Jerry Orbach]]\n* [[Luke Perry]]\n* [[Matthew Perry]]\n* [[Donnelly Rhodes]]\n* [[Geraldo Rivera]]\n* [[Doris Roberts]]\n* [[Debra Jo Rupp]]\n* [[Jennifer Salt]]\n* [[Peter Scolari]]\n* [[Liz Sheridan]]\n* [[Yeardley Smith]]\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]]\n* [[Adrian Zmed]]\n* [[Harold Gould]]\n* [[Betty White]]\n{{col end}}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n{{Main|List of Empty Nest episodes}}\n{{:List of Empty Nest episodes}}\n\n==Production notes==\nIn 1991, ''Empty Nest'' spawned its own spinoff, ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', a sitcom about a group of nurses working in the same hospital as Dr. Weston. The three series (''Empty Nest'', ''The Golden Girls'' and ''Nurses'') represented one of the few times in American television history that three shows from the same producer, all taking place in the same city and explicitly set up with the characters knowing each other from the very beginning, aired on the same network in one night. On at least two occasions, Harris wrote storylines which carried through all three series as [[fictional crossover]]s.\n\nMulligan and Manoff had previously appeared as father-in-law and daughter-in-law respectively, in the show ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', created by the same production team as ''Empty Nest''.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's theme song was \"Life Goes On\", written by [[John Bettis]] and [[George Tipton]] and performed by [[Billy Vera]]. For the first three seasons, the song was presented in a slower, more melancholy yet comical arrangement. The original opening titles sequence showed Harry Weston taking Dreyfuss for a walk around town, with still images of the other regular cast members shown as they were credited.\n\nWhen the fourth season began, a new opening sequence debuted, made up of footage from the series' episodes showing each of the regular cast members. For the final four seasons the theme song was presented in a higher, more upbeat arrangement with female backup singers; the titles sequence style introduced in the third season remained.\n\n==Crossovers==\nThe following is a list of ''Empty Nest'' episodes featuring characters from ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' or ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]''.\n;Season One\n* Episode 4: \"Fatal Attraction\" \u2013 [[Blanche Devereaux]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n* Episode 10: \"Libby's Gift\" \u2013 [[Sophia Petrillo]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n* Episode 14: \"Strange Bedfellows\" \u2013 [[Rose Nylund]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n* Episode 17: \"Dumped\" \u2013 [[Dorothy Zbornak]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n;Season Two\n* Episode 6: \"Rambo of Neiman Marcus\" \u2013 [[Rose Nylund]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n;Season Four\n* Episode 8: \"Windy\" \u2013 [[Sophia Petrillo]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n* Episode 20: \"Dr. Weston and Mr. Hyde\" \u2013 [[Rose Nylund]] from ''The Golden Girls''\n;Season Five\n* Episode 20: \"Love and Marriage\" \u2013 Jack Trenton from ''Nurses''\n;Season Six\n* Episode 2: \"Bye-Bye, Baby...

{"title_page": "Mathematical coincidence", "text_new": "{{short description|A coincidence in mathematics}}\n{{About|numerical curiosities|the technical mathematical concept of coincidence|Coincidence point}}\n\nA '''mathematical coincidence''' is said to occur when two expressions with no direct relationship  show a near-equality which has no apparent theoretical explanation.\n\nFor example, there is a near-equality close to the [[round number]] 1000 between powers of 2 and powers of 10:\n\n{{Quotation|<math>2^{10} = 1024 \\approx 1000 = 10^3</math>}}\n\nSome mathematical coincidences are used in [[engineering]] when one expression is taken as an approximation of another.\n\n==Introduction==\nA mathematical coincidence often involves an [[integer]], and the surprising feature is the fact that a [[real number]] arising in some context is considered by some standard as a \"close\" approximation to a small integer or to a multiple or power of ten, or more generally, to a [[rational number]] with a small [[denominator]].  Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered.  In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come 'out of the blue'.\n\nGiven the [[countably infinite]] number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the [[strong law of small numbers]] is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Beyond this, some sense of [[Mathematical beauty|mathematical aesthetics]] could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see [[Ramanujan's constant]] below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke<ref name=\"gardner\">Reprinted as {{Cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|authorlink1=Martin Gardner|title=The Colossal Book of Mathematics|year=2001|publisher=W.

All in all, though, they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value or, perhaps, to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level.\n\n==Some examples==\n\n===Rational approximants===\nSometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally close to interesting irrational values.  These are explainable in terms of large terms in the [[continued fraction]] representation of the irrational value, but further insight into why such improbably large terms occur is often not available.\n\nRational approximants (convergents of continued fractions) to ratios of logs of different numbers are often invoked as well, making coincidences between the powers of those numbers.<ref name=schroeder/>\n\nMany other coincidences are combinations of numbers that put them into the form that such rational approximants provide close relationships.\n\n====Concerning \u03c0====\n* The second [[convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]] of \u03c0, [3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.1428..., was known to [[Archimedes]],<ref name=beckmann/> and is correct to about 0.04%.

Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered.  In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come 'out of the blue'.\n\nGiven the [[countably infinite]] number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the [[strong law of small numbers]] is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Beyond this, some sense of [[Mathematical beauty|mathematical aesthetics]] could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see [[Ramanujan's constant]] below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke<ref name=\"gardner\">Reprinted as {{Cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|authorlink1=Martin Gardner|title=The Colossal Book of Mathematics|year=2001|publisher=W.

This is a pure coincidence, as the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the Earth's pole and equator along the surface at sea level, and the Earth's circumference just happens to be about 2/15 of a light-second.<ref name=\"Miracles\">{{cite web|last=Michon|first=G\u00e9rard P.|title=Numerical Coincidences in Man-Made Numbers|url=http://www.numericana.com/answer/miracles.htm|work=Mathematical Miracles|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> It is also roughly equal to one foot per nanosecond (the actual number is 0.9836&nbsp;ft/ns).\n\n====Earth's diameter====\nThe polar diameter of the Earth is equal to half a billion inches, to within 0.1%.<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid |first1=Charles |last1=Smythe |page=39 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xB0WSOokTg0C&pg=PA39 |year=2004 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1-4179-7429-0}}</ref>\n\n====Angular diameters of the Sun and the Moon====\nAs seen from Earth, the [[angular diameter]] of the [[Sun]] varies between 31\u203227\u2033 and 32\u203232\u2033, while that of the [[Moon]] is between 29\u203220\u2033 and 34\u20326\u2033. The fact that the intervals overlap (the former interval is contained in the latter) is a coincidence, and has implications for the types of [[solar eclipse]]s that can be observed from Earth.\n\n====Gravitational acceleration====\n{{See also|Seconds pendulum}}\nWhile not constant but varying depending on [[latitude]] and [[altitude]], the numerical value of the [[gravitational acceleration|acceleration caused by Earth's gravity]] on the surface lies between 9.74 and 9.87, which is quite close to 10. This means that as a result of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], the weight of a kilogram of mass on Earth's surface corresponds roughly to 10 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] of force exerted on an object.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cracking the AP Physics B & C Exam, 2004\u20132005 Edition |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcX_TvhNjK0C&pg=PA25&dq=approximation |isbn=978-0-375-76387-8 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton Review Publishing}}</ref>\n\nThis is related to the aforementioned coincidence that the square of pi is close to 10. One of the early definitions of the meter was the length of a pendulum whose half swing had a period equal to one second. Since the period of the full swing of a pendulum is approximated by the equation below, algebra shows that if this definition was maintained, gravitational acceleration measured in meters per second per second would be exactly equal to <math>\\pi^2</math>.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/03/what-does-pi-have-to-do-with-gravity/|title=What Does Pi Have To Do With Gravity?|journal=Wired|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref>\n:<math>T \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt\\frac{L}{g}</math>\n\nWhen it was discovered that the circumference of the earth was very close to 40,000,000 times this value, the meter was [[Meter#Timeline of definition|redefined]] to reflect this, as it was a more objective standard (because the gravitational acceleration varies over the surface of the Earth). This had the effect of increasing the length of the meter by less than 1%, which was within the experimental error of the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAnother coincidence related to the gravitational acceleration ''[[gravitational acceleration|g]]'' is that its value of approximately 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> is equal to 1.03&nbsp;[[light-year]]/year<sup>2</sup>, which numerical value is close to 1. This is related to the fact that ''g'' is close to 10 in [[International System of Units|SI units]] (m/s<sup>2</sup>), as mentioned above, combined with the fact that the number of seconds per year happens to be close to the numerical value of ''c''/10, with ''c'' the [[speed of light]] in m/s.  In fact, it has nothing to do with SI as ''c/g'' = 354 days, nearly, and 365/354 = 1.03.\n\n====Rydberg constant====\nThe [[Rydberg constant]], when multiplied by the speed of light and expressed as a frequency, is close to <math>\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}\\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{Hz}</math>:<ref name=\"Miracles\"/>\n\n:<math>\\underline{3.2898}41960364(17) \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{Hz} = R_\\infty c</math><ref>{{cite web|title=Rydberg constant times c in Hz|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydchz|work=Fundamental physical constants|publisher=NIST|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\underline{3.2898}68133696\\ldots = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}</math>\n\n====US customary to metric conversions====\nAs discovered by [[Randall Munroe]], a cubic mile is close to <math>\\frac{4}{3}\\pi</math> cubic kilometers (within 0.5%).

This is the second video game under Grid series not to feature Toyota cars and First in series to not to feature Chevrolet Corvette.\n\n===Tracks===\nIn the case of the tracks, the main emphasis is on real-world permanent circuits which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]], [[Brands Hatch]], [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]], to more modern facilities, like the [[Circuit of the Americas]], [[Sepang International Circuit|Sepang]], the [[Red Bull Ring]] and the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] in Abu Dhabi.

This occurred in the spring of 2013. Evan-Jones had this to say on the short development cycle between the two games and the general intentions with ''Grid Autosport'':<ref name=\"evan-jones interview\">{{cite web |url=http://gamewatcher.com/interviews/grid-autosport-interview/11195 |title=GRID Autosport Interview with Producer Toby Evan-Jones | publisher=GameWatcher |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Historically we've kind of alternated between [the Dirt and the Grid series, but] when we put [''Grid 2''] out we stood back and took stock and there was a lot of stuff the dev team wanted to have in there in terms of optimisation, new features and generally improving things. At the same time there was a fair amount of feedback from the fans with regards to what they wanted, so additional touring car content, the return of cockpit cam and more of a nudge back to simulation rather than arcade. We though{{sic}} (\u2026) we'd keep it rolling. |sign=Codemasters Producer Toby Evan-Jones}}\n\nThe game eliminated the so-called TrueFeel handling of ''Grid 2'', but it did not simply return to the handling of ''Race Driver: Grid''. Codemasters used a new, improved version of its previous model, better simulating how grip falls away, when the player approaches the slip angle of the tyres. Decision to use the new model, which was tested by [[Autosport|''Autosport'' magazine]] experts and racing drivers, was made on 23 January 2014, which was followed by applying it to each car\u2019s grip falloff graph and re-tuning the vehicles' individual handling characteristics. According to the company, the shift caused the most difficulties in modeling the behaviour of open wheelers and American muscle cars. It also necessitated re-doing the AI benchmarking work, which was well-underway by then using the old model. The game was built using Codemasters\u2019 in-house [[EGO (game engine)|EGO 3.0 engine]].<ref name=\"handling\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/05/grid-autosport-handling-chronicles/ |title=The Handling Chronicles |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nGraphically, ''Grid Autosport'' benefitted heavily from optimisation and fine-tuning of said long-standing engine to achieve better performance on low-end machines, while on the other end, support for [[DirectX|DirectX 11]] features enabled the programmers to improve renderings, especially grass and light, from ''Grid 2''.<ref name=\"nicholls interview 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/grid_autosport/news/grid_autosport_interview_when_we_do_make_a_next-gen_game_it_wont_be_a_current-gen_port.html |title=GRID Autosport Interview: 'When we do make a next-gen game, it won't be a current-gen port' |publisher=VideoGamer.com |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref> On 4 March 2015, Feral Interactive announced that it would port the game to OS X and Linux.<ref name=\"feralannouncement\">{{cite web|url=https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/460/ |title=Three new games confirmed for Linux and Mac |publisher=Feral Interactive |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref> The online multiplayer system was also among the areas that Codemasters decided to overhaul compared to ''Grid 2'', based on fan feedback. The framework of earning XP and cash to purchase own vehicles and garage slots was a result of community criticism towards the previous framework in which the player had a ladder, laid out in advance by the game, to unlock cars. Feedback deemed the old approach too easy to complete. As for the extremely tight development schedule, involving less than twelve months, lead designer James Nicholls said:<ref name=\"nicholls interview\"/>\n\n{{quote|text=Many developers will tell you that the toughest bit of making any game is that initial phase \u2013 getting the technology and the tools to the point where a whole team are really moving through the gears and producing at full speed.

The majority of these can be broken down into two main categories: mini expansions and car packs. Codemasters put out three mini expansions for this Grid title.

[[Metacritic]] gave it an aggregate score of 78/100 for PC and 75/100 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.{{r|metacritic pc|metacritic ps3|metacritic x360}} Critics especially praised its more authentic handling model as well as its stripped-down approach to racing and excellent damage system.\n\nThe Career mode gained widespread approval for being \"simply about winning races and mastering various driving styles\" with the ability to switch between disciplines letting the player \"go as focused or as broad as [he or she] likes.\"<ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' felt that having a nominated opponent provided \"a decent sense of rivalry (\u2026) which gives races more meaning (\u2026) and the experience is richer for having clear rivals to beat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called Online mode \"a comprehensive suite\", one which \"a series of [car] mods and upgrades lends persistence\" to.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' said that it \"offers slightly more freedom [than the Career mode]\" and its feature set is \"varied.\"<ref name=\"game informer review\"/> The online playing experience was considered \"smooth, with no drop outs or lag experienced.\"<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/>\n\nIn terms of handling, the reviewers emphasised that the game \"still straddles the line between simulation and arcade,\" but it \"definitely leans a little further on the side of realism [than most Codemasters games]\" and \"it\u2019s a significant improvement on Grid 2\u2019s awkward dynamics.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' noted that it \"offers considerable depth\" and its \"lively feedback makes for an intense, and satisfying, drive.\" Despite that, it is \"still approachable\" and Luke Reilly from [[IGN]] found the model to be \"fairly forgiving.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/><ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nThe game\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) behaviour was said to be a success, at least in part. The computer-controlled opponents\u2019 \"defensive driving lines, late-braking overshoots into hairpins, and fiendishly clever cut-backs\" can make \"a normally disappointing 8th place finish (\u2026) just as rewarding as a win.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> As for their speed, it is heavily dependent on difficulty levels, of which the lowest allows the player to \"thread through 16 positions over the course of three laps with little resistance\", while on the hardest \"you can spend a whole race exchanging 13th and 14th positions with another car.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/>\n\n''[[PC Advisor]]'' praised the \"immense\" variety of cars present in the game as well as the inclusion of \"plenty of classics\".<ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' added that the \"more experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between their fleet.\" The title\u2019s damage model was critically acclaimed as the above review highlighted that \"each car [is] responding accurately to collisions\" with the crashes having \"a massive effect on performance.\"<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/> ''Edge'' deemed the system a \"triumph.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> The introduction of tyre wear (in Endurance events) was also welcomed \u2013 ''GamesRadar+'' wrote that \"it becomes so integral to the driving process, you\u2019ll find yourself looking for the [tyre life] percentage indicators in other modes every time you hear the wheels slip.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> ''Grid Autosport'' has a \"generous selection of tracks\", in which \"real-world circuits are the focus\" at the expense of \"unforgiving (\u2026) and tight\" street circuits.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/>\n\nThe general graphical qualities of the game were lauded as \"magnificent\" and \"lovely\" with \"incidental details [on the race track that] make for an engaging race-day atmosphere\" being particularly impressing.<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> As for the game interface, ''Edge'' hailed its \"pared-down design (\u2026) with simple, clean (and fast loading) menus.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> Similarly to graphics, the most positive aspects of sounds were the details; the \"nice ambient effects\" and the \"small touches such as being able to hear the commentators over the track\" that make the experience \"more immersive.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''GamesRadar+'' found the new system of being able to request information on the pit channel useful, claiming \"you can rely on aural feedback (\u2026) for maximum authenticity.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/>\n\nBy far the most heavily criticised feature of the game was, ironically, the returning cockpit view. It is, while \"incredibly welcome from a gameplay standpoint, (\u2026) visually they're a slapped-on eyesore, blurred-out in an attempt to hide the lack of detail.\"<ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> IGN remarked that they \"lack any working dials or mirrors.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nSeveral reviews mention that they found the AI to be, depending on discipline, too aggressive, so much so that \"having an AI take you out at least once a race is (\u2026) to be expected.\"<ref name=\"pc powerplay review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''Edge'' elaborated that \"they don\u2019t always concede in the same way a human driver might, sticking to their chosen route even though you legitimately out-braked them into a corner.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> Leaving out pit stops also left some of the critics puzzled.

The teams \u2013 including the best-in-the-business Ravenwest, making a return from ''Race Driver: Grid'' \u2013 each have different season objectives and sponsor objectives, the achievement of which earns extra experience points (XP) for the players besides those received for their results.<ref name=\"gamespot review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grid-autosport-review/1900-6415799/ |title=GRID Autosport Review |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> Online racing is conducted via RaceNet, Codemasters' own community hub, on which players can form racing clubs, earn XP and cash as they race and fulfill sponsor objectives, then use their earnings to purchase and upgrade vehicles. Soon after the game's release, they were also presented with sets of specific challenges, called RaceNet Challenges, announced by Codemasters.<ref name=\"online 1\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/05/discipline-progression-game-modes/ |title=Online Discipline Progression & Game Modes |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Grid Autosport'' emphasises the concept of racing disciplines, making them into the new event categories. There are five main categories: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. During Career mode, the player picks a particular event in one of these categories, with each event (a string of races) making up a season.<ref name=\"faq\"/> Each discipline features markedly different cars and race types. The latter include standard Races, Endurance races with tire wear enabled, Time Attack events, Drift events, and - as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) - Time Trials, Drag and point-to-point Sprint races. These are all accessible in Custom Cup mode as well, in which the player can also choose to participate in certain special event types, such as Checkpoint, Eliminator and Demolition Derby.<ref name=\"kotaku review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2014/06/24/grid-autosport-kotaku-review |title=GRID Autosport: The Kotaku Review |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nFocusing on providing a more realistic driving experience, the studio revamped its damage model, adding new elements, such as a wear and tear system, which means car parts lose performance through general use, and a suspension damage system. It also introduced a new team radio philosophy in which the player itself can request information on car damage, gaps, rival position and teammate position.<ref name=\"damage\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/05/the-damage-of-grid-autosport/ |title=The Damage of GRID Autosport |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref> The player can also ask its engineer to instruct their teammates to attack, defend or hold their position.<ref name=\"announcement\"/> By popular demand, Codemasters retained its unique Flashback feature from previous Grid installments with which the players can rewind their races a few seconds and resume it earlier, if needed.<ref name=\"assists\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/04/your-race-your-rules-your-options/ |title=Your Race, Your Rules, Your Options |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> Cockpit view also made a return,<ref name=\"announcement\"/> after being absent, very much to the dismay of the core fanbase,<ref name=\"fan backlash\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/08/13/grid-2-no-cockpit-view-because-less-than-5-of-gamers-use-it-codies-respond/ |title=GRID 2: \u2018No cockpit view because less than 5% of gamers use it\u2019 \u2013 Codies respond |publisher=VG247 |accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> in ''Grid 2''. Aside from such elements, the developers generally decided to strip the game down and do away with everything that stood in the way of raw racing. These features included ''Grid 2''\u2019s narrator-driven career mode and superfluous menus.<ref name=\"nicholls interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/07/grid-autosport-why-listening-to-fans-resulted-in-the-ultimate-codemasters-racer/ |title=GRID: Autosport - why listening to the fans resulted in the ultimate Codemasters racer |publisher=VG247 |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Cars===\nThe cars in the disciplines of ''Grid Autosport'' are further divided into tiers and classes of various strength. Some of the highlights of the vehicles on offer are the contemporary [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] (Class C), [[Stock Car Brasil]] (Class A) and [[V8 Supercars]] (Super Tourers) of the Touring discipline (e. g. [[Chevrolet Cruze and [[Holden Commodore (VF, as well as the present-day and classic [[Grand tourer|GT cars]] of the Endurance discipline (like the [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3]] (Category B) and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk I]]), the [[Dallara DW12]] chassis of the [[IndyCar Series]] (Formula A) from the Open Wheel discipline, American [[muscle car]]s (e. g. the [[Ford Mustang Boss 302]]), among others, representing the Tuner discipline and the likes of the [[Bugatti Veyron|Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport]] and the [[Koenigsegg Agera|Koenigsegg Agera R]] (Hypercars) representing the Street discipline.<ref name=\"car list\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/06/the-cars-of-grid-autosport/ |title=The Cars of GRID Autosport |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> In total, including DLCs, the game features 103 cars. This is the second video game under Grid series not to feature Toyota cars and First in series to not to feature Chevrolet Corvette.\n\n===Tracks===\nIn the case of the tracks, the main emphasis is on real-world permanent circuits which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]], [[Brands Hatch]], [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]], to more modern facilities, like the [[Circuit of the Americas]], [[Sepang International Circuit|Sepang]], the [[Red Bull Ring]] and the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] in Abu Dhabi. City locations with fictionally lined, but mostly real-world streets of San Francisco, Paris, Dubai etc., and - as DLCs - fictional point-to-point tracks in authentic settings complete the picture.<ref name=\"track list\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/06/grid-autosport-track-list/ |title=GRID Autosport Track List |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"sprint dlc\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/08/grid-autosport-sprint-pack/ |title=GRID Autosport // Sprint Pack |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> In all, players are able to race on 15 real-world permanent circuits, 2 fictional permanent circuits, 7 street circuits, and 4 point-to-point tracks, including additional content, for a total of 28 locations with over 130 configurations.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ford GT at Legendy 2019 in Prague.jpg|right|thumb|''Grid Autosport'' features several licensed cars from various racing disciplines, such as the [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]].]]\n''Grid Autosport'' was announced on 22 April 2014 via the official Codemasters Blog, less than a year after the release of its predecessor, ''Grid 2''.<ref name=\"announcement\"/> Producer Toby Evan-Jones revealed in an interview that the development of the new title began as soon as the development of ''Grid 2'' came close to a finish. This occurred in the spring of 2013. Evan-Jones had this to say on the short development cycle between the two games and the general intentions with ''Grid Autosport'':<ref name=\"evan-jones interview\">{{cite web |url=http://gamewatcher.com/interviews/grid-autosport-interview/11195 |title=GRID Autosport Interview with Producer Toby Evan-Jones | publisher=GameWatcher |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=Historically we've kind of alternated between [the Dirt and the Grid series, but] when we put [''Grid 2''] out we stood back and took stock and there was a lot of stuff the dev team wanted to have in there in terms of optimisation, new features and generally improving things. At the same time there was a fair amount of feedback from the fans with regards to what they wanted, so additional touring car content, the return of cockpit cam and more of a nudge back to simulation rather than arcade. We though{{sic}} (\u2026) we'd keep it rolling. |sign=Codemasters Producer Toby Evan-Jones}}\n\nThe game eliminated the so-called TrueFeel handling of ''Grid 2'', but it did not simply return to the handling of ''Race Driver: Grid''. Codemasters used a new, improved version of its previous model, better simulating how grip falls away, when the player approaches the slip angle of the tyres. Decision to use the new model, which was tested by [[Autosport|''Autosport'' magazine]] experts and racing drivers, was made on 23 January 2014, which was followed by applying it to each car\u2019s grip falloff graph and re-tuning the vehicles' individual handling characteristics. According to the company, the shift caused the most difficulties in modeling the behaviour of open wheelers and American muscle cars. It also necessitated re-doing the AI benchmarking work, which was well-underway by then using the old model. The game was built using Codemasters\u2019 in-house [[EGO (game engine)|EGO 3.0 engine]].<ref name=\"handling\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/05/grid-autosport-handling-chronicles/ |title=The Handling Chronicles |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nGraphically, ''Grid Autosport'' benefitted heavily from optimisation and fine-tuning of said long-standing engine to achieve better performance on low-end machines, while on the other end, support for [[DirectX|DirectX 11]] features enabled the programmers to improve renderings, especially grass and light, from ''Grid 2''.<ref name=\"nicholls interview 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/grid_autosport/news/grid_autosport_interview_when_we_do_make_a_next-gen_game_it_wont_be_a_current-gen_port.html |title=GRID Autosport Interview: 'When we do make a next-gen game, it won't be a current-gen port' |publisher=VideoGamer.com |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref> On 4 March 2015, Feral Interactive announced that it would port the game to OS X and Linux.<ref name=\"feralannouncement\">{{cite web|url=https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/460/ |title=Three new games confirmed for Linux and Mac |publisher=Feral Interactive |accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref> The online multiplayer system was also among the areas that Codemasters decided to overhaul compared to ''Grid 2'', based on fan feedback. The framework of earning XP and cash to purchase own vehicles and garage slots was a result of community criticism towards the previous framework in which the player had a ladder, laid out in advance by the game, to unlock cars. Feedback deemed the old approach too easy to complete. As for the extremely tight development schedule, involving less than twelve months, lead designer James Nicholls said:<ref name=\"nicholls interview\"/>\n\n{{quote|text=Many developers will tell you that the toughest bit of making any game is that initial phase \u2013 getting the technology and the tools to the point where a whole team are really moving through the gears and producing at full speed.

The majority of these can be broken down into two main categories: mini expansions and car packs. Codemasters put out three mini expansions for this Grid title. Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated one of these was the Touring Legends Pack as it featured two new real-world circuits \u2013 [[Donington Park]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] \u2013, five classic BTCC touring cars from the mid-1990s and new single player championships (outside Career mode).<ref name=\"touring legends pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/09/grid-autosport-touring-legends/ |title=GRID Autosport // Touring Legends |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> Another mini expansion, called Sprint Pack, introduced the Sprint race type to the game, besides featuring four fictional point-to-point tracks and more extra championships.<ref name=\"sprint pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/08/grid-autosport-sprint-pack/ |title=GRID Autosport // Sprint Pack |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> The third one, the Drag Pack, introduced the Drag race type, three drag cars and nine single player championships.<ref name=\"drag pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/10/grid-autosport-drag-racing/ |title=GRID Autosport // Drag Pack |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nCar packs, of which there were three as well, included the Best of British Pack, which contained three British-originated vehicles, e. g. the [[McLaren F1 GTR]],<ref name=\"best of British pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/07/best-of-british-car-pack-grid-autosport/ |title=Best of British Car Pack // GRID Autosport |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> the Coup\u00e9 Style Pack, that offered four new coup\u00e9s, such as the [[Hyundai Genesis Coupe|Hyundai Genesis Coup\u00e9]],<ref name=\"coupe style pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/08/grid-autosport-coupe-style-and-black-edition/ |title=GRID Autosport // Coup\u00e9 Style and Black Edition |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> and a Road & Track Pack, which added two road-going cars and two racing cars to the game.<ref name=\"road and track pack\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.codemasters.com/grid/09/grid-autosport-road-and-track-pack/ |title=GRID Autosport // Road and Track Pack |publisher=Codemasters Blog |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> There has been a number of additional DLC available to the game.

[[Metacritic]] gave it an aggregate score of 78/100 for PC and 75/100 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.{{r|metacritic pc|metacritic ps3|metacritic x360}} Critics especially praised its more authentic handling model as well as its stripped-down approach to racing and excellent damage system.\n\nThe Career mode gained widespread approval for being \"simply about winning races and mastering various driving styles\" with the ability to switch between disciplines letting the player \"go as focused or as broad as [he or she] likes.\"<ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' felt that having a nominated opponent provided \"a decent sense of rivalry (\u2026) which gives races more meaning (\u2026) and the experience is richer for having clear rivals to beat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called Online mode \"a comprehensive suite\", one which \"a series of [car] mods and upgrades lends persistence\" to.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' said that it \"offers slightly more freedom [than the Career mode]\" and its feature set is \"varied.\"<ref name=\"game informer review\"/> The online playing experience was considered \"smooth, with no drop outs or lag experienced.\"<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/>\n\nIn terms of handling, the reviewers emphasised that the game \"still straddles the line between simulation and arcade,\" but it \"definitely leans a little further on the side of realism [than most Codemasters games]\" and \"it\u2019s a significant improvement on Grid 2\u2019s awkward dynamics.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' noted that it \"offers considerable depth\" and its \"lively feedback makes for an intense, and satisfying, drive.\" Despite that, it is \"still approachable\" and Luke Reilly from [[IGN]] found the model to be \"fairly forgiving.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/><ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nThe game\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) behaviour was said to be a success, at least in part. The computer-controlled opponents\u2019 \"defensive driving lines, late-braking overshoots into hairpins, and fiendishly clever cut-backs\" can make \"a normally disappointing 8th place finish (\u2026) just as rewarding as a win.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> As for their speed, it is heavily dependent on difficulty levels, of which the lowest allows the player to \"thread through 16 positions over the course of three laps with little resistance\", while on the hardest \"you can spend a whole race exchanging 13th and 14th positions with another car.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/>\n\n''[[PC Advisor]]'' praised the \"immense\" variety of cars present in the game as well as the inclusion of \"plenty of classics\".<ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' added that the \"more experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between their fleet.\" The title\u2019s damage model was critically acclaimed as the above review highlighted that \"each car [is] responding accurately to collisions\" with the crashes having \"a massive effect on performance.\"<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/> ''Edge'' deemed the system a \"triumph.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> The introduction of tyre wear (in Endurance events) was also welcomed \u2013 ''GamesRadar+'' wrote that \"it becomes so integral to the driving process, you\u2019ll find yourself looking for the [tyre life] percentage indicators in other modes every time you hear the wheels slip.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> ''Grid Autosport'' has a \"generous selection of tracks\", in which \"real-world circuits are the focus\" at the expense of \"unforgiving (\u2026) and tight\" street circuits.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/>\n\nThe general graphical qualities of the game were lauded as \"magnificent\" and \"lovely\" with \"incidental details [on the race track that] make for an engaging race-day atmosphere\" being particularly impressing.<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> As for the game interface, ''Edge'' hailed its \"pared-down design (\u2026) with simple, clean (and fast loading) menus.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> Similarly to graphics, the most positive aspects of sounds were the details; the \"nice ambient effects\" and the \"small touches such as being able to hear the commentators over the track\" that make the experience \"more immersive.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''GamesRadar+'' found the new system of being able to request information on the pit channel useful, claiming \"you can rely on aural feedback (\u2026) for maximum authenticity.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/>\n\nBy far the most heavily criticised feature of the game was, ironically, the returning cockpit view. It is, while \"incredibly welcome from a gameplay standpoint, (\u2026) visually they're a slapped-on eyesore, blurred-out in an attempt to hide the lack of detail.\"<ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> IGN remarked that they \"lack any working dials or mirrors.\"<ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nSeveral reviews mention that they found the AI to be, depending on discipline, too aggressive, so much so that \"having an AI take you out at least once a race is (\u2026) to be expected.\"<ref name=\"pc powerplay review\"/><ref name=\"pc advisor review\"/> ''Edge'' elaborated that \"they don\u2019t always concede in the same way a human driver might, sticking to their chosen route even though you legitimately out-braked them into a corner.\"<ref name=\"edge review\"/> Leaving out pit stops also left some of the critics puzzled. IGN said \"it\u2019s a bizarre omission (\u2026) that quietly undermines a lot of what Autosport does right\", pointing out that suffering a puncture leaves the player with no option to repair the damage.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\n''Eurogamer'' warned that the content-wise excellent Career mode can feel \"long and drawn-out\" and that \"progress in GRID Autosport is slow.\"<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> [[GameTrailers]] added that \"the whole experience feels rather clinical.\"<ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/> The reception of the request-based team radio was also mixed with ''GamesRadar+'' arguing that \"the pit audio repeats itself far too quickly and doesn\u2019t always make perfect sense.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar review\"/> Finally, a number of reviewers noted that a lot of cars and tracks are re-used material from earlier Codemasters titles, which feels \"stale\".<ref name=\"kotaku review\"/><ref name=\"gametrailers review\"/><ref name=\"pc gamer review\"/>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n\n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.gridgame.com}}\n\n{{TOCA series}}\n{{EGO Engine games}}\n{{Codemasters}}\n\n[[Category:2014 video games]]\n[[Category:Codemasters games]]\n[[Category:EGO (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Feral Interactive games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Sports video games with career mode]]\n[[Category:TOCA]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Australia]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Detroit]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Video games set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Arab Emirates]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n", "name_user": "Desb42", "label": "safe", "comment": "balance links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_Autosport"}
