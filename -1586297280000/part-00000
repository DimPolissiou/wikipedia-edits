Since music was always his first love, he went on to [[Columbia University]] to study music composition and conducting, where his passion became his profession. He quickly became busy as an arranger in New York; he moved to California in 1968 to pursue work in the movie and television field while continuing to write and arrange jazz albums.\n\nWilliams was also a leader in the music-education field for many years. He served as the Artistic Director of the Henry Mancini Institute \u2014 one of the nation's premier training programs for young musicians seeking professional careers in music \u2014 for five years. He was Visiting Professor and Composer-in-Residence at the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], which awarded him an honorary doctorate. He also held an honorary doctorate from Duke University and performed and/or lectured at such other institutions as the [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Indiana University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Yale University]].\n\n==Career==\nWilliams scored more than 200 films, including ''[[Breaking Away]]'', for which he received a 1978 Oscar nomination; ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'', ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'', ''[[Cuba (film)|Cuba]]'', and ''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]''.\n\nOn television, his music accompanied ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', and ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]''. His jazz-funk arrangement of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Get Back]]\" was used as the longtime theme for the 1970s sports quiz show ''[[Sports Challenge]]'', emceed by [[Dick Enberg]].\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] asked Williams to arrange and conduct his two ''Duets'' albums. For clarinetist [[Eddie Daniels]], Williams wrote ''A Concerto in Swing''; for saxophonist [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], he penned ''Romances for Jazz Soloist and Orchestra''. His ''Theme For Earth Day'' was recorded by [[John Williams]] and the [[Boston Pops]].\n\n''An American Concerto'', composed in 1976, was one of the first successful attempts to combine jazz elements with traditional symphonic writing. In addition to ''An American Concerto'' his compositions include ''Gulliver'', ''Romances'', ''Earth Day'', ''Adagio'', and ''August'', as well as ''Suite Memories'' for trombone and symphony orchestra, which won a 1986 Grammy; ''Spring Wings'', a double concerto for piano and saxophone and symphony orchestra; ''Appalachian Morning'', recorded by the Boston Pops; ''Memento Mei'' for solo soprano and orchestra; ''The Prayer of St. Francis'' for flute and strings; and others.\n\nAnother of Williams' accomplishments was the 1986 orchestral work ''Gulliver''. He spent eight months writing the work, which was recorded by London's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], with narration by [[Larry Gelbart]] (based on [[Jonathon Swift]]'s writings) read by [[John Gielgud]]. For the concert premier, Williams conducted the Yale Philharmonia with [[Tony Randall]] narrating.\n\nIn 2016, [[Deana Martin]], daughter of [[Dean Martin]], recorded a new swing album, which Williams scored and conducted. He also wrote five songs for the album: \"52nd & Broadway,\" co-written with Gail Kantor, \"I've Been Around,\" \"Hearing Ella Sing,\u201d and \u201cGood Things Grow,\u201d co-written with [[Arthur Hamilton]] and \u201cI Know What You Are\u201d co-written with [[Will Jennings]]. The album ''Swing Street'' was released in 2016.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nNominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for composing the orchestral work ''An American Concerto'', he won two [[Grammy]]s for his jazz arrangements, four [[Emmy]]s for his television music, an Oscar nomination for film composition, and the Richard Kirk Award from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]. In addition to Williams' 4 Emmy wins, he received 23 nominations.\n\nFor his 2015 album ''[[Home Suite Home]]'', Williams earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album|Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2016-nominees-winners-list-story.html |title=2016 Grammy Awards: Complete list of winners and nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Williams' recordings are considered contemporary big-band standards, including ''Threshold'', which won a 1974 Grammy; ''Too Hip for the Room'', a Grammy nominee in 1983; ''Tenth Avenue'', a double Grammy nominee in 1987; and ''Sinatraland'', a tribute to the singer which was Grammy-nominated in 1998. Williams received 16 Grammy nominations for his compositions and arrangements.\n\n==Death==\nWilliams died of cancer in Santa Monica, California on July 25, 2018 at the age of 79.<ref>[https://variety.com/2018/tv/obituaries-people-news/patrick-williams-dead-dies-mary-tyler-moore-show-1202886296/ Patrick Williams, Emmy-Winning TV Composer, Dies at 79]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRespected music critic [[Gene Lees]] was quoted as saying: \"His ''An American Concerto'' is, in my opinion, the best mixture of jazz and classical that anybody has ever done. Pat's writing is breathtaking. He's just one of the finest arrangers and composers who ever put pen to paper.\"\n\nDaniel Cariaga wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \" ''An American Concerto'' must be one of the most attractive, affecting and original of jazz-symphonic meldings. The style is unrestrained, the tunes ingratiating, the writing expert. What Williams owes to the fair influences of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff seems no more and no less than other living composers may owe in those directions. What sets him a cut above others is the individual integration he has achieved out of those influences.\"\n\n==Film credits==\n*''[[Passion's Way]]'' (1999): Sela Ward, Timothy Dalton, Alicia Witt; Robert Allan Ackerman, Dir.\n*''[[Kiss the Sky (film)|Kiss the Sky]]'' (1998), MGM: William Petersen, Gary Cole, Sheryl Lee; Roger Young, Dir.\n*''[[Julian Po]]'' (1997), New Line Cinema: Christian Slater, Robin Tunney; Alan Wade, Dir.\n*''[[That Old Feeling (film)|That Old Feeling]]'' (1997), Universal: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina; Carl Reiner, Dir.\n*''Stormchasers'' (1995): Greg MacGillivray, Dir.\n*''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1995), New Line Cinema: Walter Matthau, Piper Laurie, Sissy Spacek; Charles Matthau, Dir.\n*''[[Big Girls Don't Cry...

Since music was always his first love, he went on to [[Columbia University]] to study music composition and conducting, where his passion became his profession. He quickly became busy as an arranger in New York; he moved to California in 1968 to pursue work in the movie and television field while continuing to write and arrange jazz albums.\n\nWilliams was also a leader in the music-education field for many years. He served as the Artistic Director of the Henry Mancini Institute \u2014 one of the nation's premier training programs for young musicians seeking professional careers in music \u2014 for five years. He was Visiting Professor and Composer-in-Residence at the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], which awarded him an honorary doctorate. He also held an honorary doctorate from Duke University and performed and/or lectured at such other institutions as the [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Indiana University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Yale University]].\n\n==Career==\nWilliams scored more than 200 films, including ''[[Breaking Away]]'', for which he received a 1978 Oscar nomination; ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'', ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'', ''[[Cuba (film)|Cuba]]'', and ''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]''.\n\nOn television, his music accompanied ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', and ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]''. His jazz-funk arrangement of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Get Back]]\" was used as the longtime theme for the 1970s sports quiz show ''[[Sports Challenge]]'', emceed by [[Dick Enberg]].\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] asked Williams to arrange and conduct his two ''Duets'' albums. For clarinetist [[Eddie Daniels]], Williams wrote ''A Concerto in Swing''; for saxophonist [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], he penned ''Romances for Jazz Soloist and Orchestra''. His ''Theme For Earth Day'' was recorded by [[John Williams]] and the [[Boston Pops]].\n\n''An American Concerto'', composed in 1976, was one of the first successful attempts to combine jazz elements with traditional symphonic writing. In addition to ''An American Concerto'' his compositions include ''Gulliver'', ''Romances'', ''Earth Day'', ''Adagio'', and ''August'', as well as ''Suite Memories'' for trombone and symphony orchestra, which won a 1986 Grammy; ''Spring Wings'', a double concerto for piano and saxophone and symphony orchestra; ''Appalachian Morning'', recorded by the Boston Pops; ''Memento Mei'' for solo soprano and orchestra; ''The Prayer of St. Francis'' for flute and strings; and others.\n\nAnother of Williams' accomplishments was the 1986 orchestral work ''Gulliver''. He spent eight months writing the work, which was recorded by London's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], with narration by [[Larry Gelbart]] (based on [[Jonathon Swift]]'s writings) read by [[John Gielgud]]. For the concert premier, Williams conducted the Yale Philharmonia with [[Tony Randall]] narrating.\n\nIn 2016, [[Deana Martin]], daughter of [[Dean Martin]], recorded a new swing album, which Williams scored and conducted. He also wrote five songs for the album: \"52nd & Broadway,\" co-written with Gail Kantor, \"I've Been Around,\" \"Hearing Ella Sing,\u201d and \u201cGood Things Grow,\u201d co-written with [[Arthur Hamilton]] and \u201cI Know What You Are\u201d co-written with [[Will Jennings]]. The album ''Swing Street'' was released in 2016.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nNominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for composing the orchestral work ''An American Concerto'', he won two [[Grammy]]s for his jazz arrangements, four [[Emmy]]s for his television music, an Oscar nomination for film composition, and the Richard Kirk Award from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]. In addition to Williams' 4 Emmy wins, he received 23 nominations.\n\nFor his 2015 album ''[[Home Suite Home]]'', Williams earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album|Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2016-nominees-winners-list-story.html |title=2016 Grammy Awards: Complete list of winners and nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Williams' recordings are considered contemporary big-band standards, including ''Threshold'', which won a 1974 Grammy; ''Too Hip for the Room'', a Grammy nominee in 1983; ''Tenth Avenue'', a double Grammy nominee in 1987; and ''Sinatraland'', a tribute to the singer which was Grammy-nominated in 1998. Williams received 16 Grammy nominations for his compositions and arrangements.\n\n==Death==\nWilliams died of cancer in Santa Monica, California on July 25, 2018 at the age of 79.<ref>[https://variety.com/2018/tv/obituaries-people-news/patrick-williams-dead-dies-mary-tyler-moore-show-1202886296/ Patrick Williams, Emmy-Winning TV Composer, Dies at 79]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRespected music critic [[Gene Lees]] was quoted as saying: \"His ''An American Concerto'' is, in my opinion, the best mixture of jazz and classical that anybody has ever done. Pat's writing is breathtaking. He's just one of the finest arrangers and composers who ever put pen to paper.\"\n\nDaniel Cariaga wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \" ''An American Concerto'' must be one of the most attractive, affecting and original of jazz-symphonic meldings. The style is unrestrained, the tunes ingratiating, the writing expert. What Williams owes to the fair influences of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff seems no more and no less than other living composers may owe in those directions. What sets him a cut above others is the individual integration he has achieved out of those influences.\"\n\n==Film credits==\n*''[[Passion's Way]]'' (1999): Sela Ward, Timothy Dalton, Alicia Witt; Robert Allan Ackerman, Dir.\n*''[[Kiss the Sky (film)|Kiss the Sky]]'' (1998), MGM: William Petersen, Gary Cole, Sheryl Lee; Roger Young, Dir.\n*''[[Julian Po]]'' (1997), New Line Cinema: Christian Slater, Robin Tunney; Alan Wade, Dir.\n*''[[That Old Feeling (film)|That Old Feeling]]'' (1997), Universal: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina; Carl Reiner, Dir.\n*''Stormchasers'' (1995): Greg MacGillivray, Dir.\n*''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1995), New Line Cinema: Walter Matthau, Piper Laurie, Sissy Spacek; Charles Matthau, Dir.\n*''[[Big Girls Don't Cry...

It was founded in 1993 and currently there are over 220 students. It is known for its high level of learning and for being one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in Israel. \n==History==\nIn the early 1970s, a group of [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] settled in Yeruham with the goal of imporving the south of Israel, and helping to increase the quality of life for the residents of Yerucham.  Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \"Midreshet B'Yahad\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a [[yeshiva]] as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham.\n\nThe leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben-Shalom, approached [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig]], who at the time taught at [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.\n\n'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y. Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews in modern time]] in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of contemporary scholars such as Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]].\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

It was founded in 1993 and currently there are over 220 students. It is known for its high level of learning and for being one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in Israel. \n==History==\nIn the early 1970s, a group of [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] settled in Yeruham with the goal of imporving the south of Israel, and helping to increase the quality of life for the residents of Yerucham.  Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \"Midreshet B'Yahad\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a [[yeshiva]] as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham.\n\nThe leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben-Shalom, approached [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig]], who at the time taught at [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.\n\n\n\n'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\n\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y. Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews in modern time]] in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of contemporary scholars such as Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]].\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other. However, with Mork's dangerous life still troubling him, Sun makes it clear that he is there because he cares for him.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web

As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other. However, with Mork's dangerous life still troubling him, Sun makes it clear that he is there because he cares for him.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web

Doctor-Nurse vs. Doctor-Beach).

Findings suggested a hindrance in [[hierarchical temporal memory|temporal order]], [[source amnesia|source]], [[free recall]] and [[working memory]]. However, their participants did exhibit capable short and long term memory, [[recall (memory)#Cued recall|cued recall]] and the capacity to learn new material. In sum, they suggested that there is both a general deficit in global working memory and a specific impairment in [[emotional intelligence|social intelligence]] where the former is exacerbated by the latter and vice versa.<ref name=\"Benneto96\"/>\n\nOther evidence points towards unique [[mnemonic]] strategies used by autistic individuals wherein they rely less on semantic associative networks and are less constricted by conventional word-word associations (ex.

The process of syntactic development requires a child to match co-occurrences of words or parts of words (morphemes) and their meanings. This process can depend on working memory. The limited short term verbal memory paired with working memory may be the reason of language delay in children with autism. According to the result of this experiment the group with autism was able to perform the part of the test with nonlinguistic cues which depended on working memory but failed to pass short term memory and the linguistic part of it. This explains the delay of language in autistic children and neurocognition is an important contributor to it.<ref>http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&id=A84B64CC-C257-DC9C-2FF5-E1D2CE68D435&resultID=20&page=1&dbTab=pi (broken link) </ref>\n\n===Central executive or executive functioning===\nThe symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders are thought to be greatly impacted by a dysfunction in working memory.<ref>Wang, Y., Zhang, Y.

Studies have shown that category induction is in fact possible and can occur at the same cognitive level as non-autistic individuals, however.<ref name=\"Soulieres\">{{cite journal|last= Souli\u00e8res|first=I|author2=Mottron, L|author3=Gigu\u00e8re, G|author4=Larochelle, S|title=Category induction in autism: Slower, perhaps different, but certainly possible|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=311\u2013327|doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.492994|pmid= 20623440}}</ref> Given that category formation aspects such as discrimination and [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detection]] are enhanced among autistic individuals it is viable to state that although autistic individuals require more trials and or time to learn material, and also may employ different learning strategies than non-autistic individuals, once learned, the level of categorization displayed is on par with a non-autistic individual.<ref name=\"Soulieres\"/>\n\nThe idea that autistic individuals learn differently than those without autism can account for the delay in their ability to categorize. However, once they begin categorizing they are at an average level of cognitive ability as compared to those without autism.<ref name=\"Soulieres\"/> This, however, is only applicable to higher functioning individuals within the spectrum as those with lower IQ levels are notoriously difficult to test and measure.<ref name=\"Vladusich\"/>\n\nIn part with a different style of learning, individuals within the spectrum have also been proposed to have a [[weak central coherence theory|weak central coherence]]. This theory meshes well with the general traits of individuals within the spectrum. Again though, this is explained through different learning styles. As opposed to viewing a forest as a collection of trees, those with autism see one tree, and another tree, and another tree and thus it takes an immense amount of time to process complex tasks in comparison with non-autistic people).<ref name=\"Vladusich\">{{cite journal|title=Prototypical category learning in high-functioning autism|first=T|last=Vladusich|author2=Olufemi, O|author3=Kim, DS|author4=Tager-Flusberg, H|author5=Grossberg, S|journal=Autism Research|date=October 2010|volume=3|issue=5|pages=226\u2013236|doi=10.1002/aur.148|pmid=20717947}}</ref> Weak central coherence can be used to explain what is viewed as a working memory deficit in attention or inhibition, as autistic individuals possess an intense focus on single parts of a complex, multi-part concept and cannot inhibit this in order to withdraw focus and direct it on the whole rather than a singular aspect. Thus, this suggests that the decrement in working memory is partially inherited which is then exacerbated by further genetic complications leading to a diagnosis of autism.\n\n===Visual and spatial memory===\n\nDeficits in spatial working memory appear to be familiar in people with autism, and probably even in their close relatives.<ref name=\"Koczat\">{{cite journal|last=Kozcat|first=DL |author2=Rogers, SJ |author3=Pennington, BF |author4=Ross, RG|title=Eye movement abnormality suggestive of a spatial working memory deficit is present in parents of autistic probands|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=6|pages=513\u2013518|year=2002|doi=10.1023/A:1021246712459}}</ref> Replication of movements by others, a task that requires spatial awareness and memory capacities, can also be difficult for autistic children and adults.<ref>{{cite book|last=Happ\u00e9|first=Francesca|title=Autism: an introduction to psychological theory|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-05312-0|page=36}}</ref>\n\nPeople with Asperger's Syndrome were found to have spatial working memory deficits compared with control subjects on the Executive-Golf Task, although these may be indicative of a more general deficit in non-verbal intelligence in people with ASD.<ref name=\"Morris\">{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=R|title=Spatial Working Memory in Asperger's Syndrome and in Patients with Focal Frontal and Temporal Lobe Lesions|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 October 1999|volume=41|issue=1|pages=9\u201326|doi=10.1006/brcg.1999.1093|last2=Rowe|first2=A.|last3=Fox|first3=N.|last4=Feigenbaum|first4=J.D.|last5=Miotto|first5=E.C.|last6=Howlin|first6=P.|pmid=10536083}}</ref> Despite these results, autistic children have been found to be superior to typically developing children in certain tasks, such as map learning and cued path recall regarding a navigated real-life labyrinth.<ref name=\"Caron\">{{cite journal|last=Caron|first=M|title=Do high functioning persons with autism present superior spatial abilities?|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1 January 2004|volume=42|issue=4|pages=467\u2013481|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.08.015|pmid=14728920|last2=Mottron|first2=L|last3=Rainville|first3=C|last4=Chouinard|first4=S}}</ref> Steele et al. attempt to explain this discrepancy by advancing the theory that the performance of autistic people on spatial memory tasks degrades faster in the face of increasing task difficulty, when compared with normally developed individuals.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Shelly D.|author2=Minshew, Nancy J.|author3=Luna, Beatriz|author4=Sweeney, John A.|title=Spatial Working Memory Deficits in Autism|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=April 2007|volume=37|issue=4|pages=605\u2013612|doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0202-2|pmid=16909311}}</ref> These results suggest that working memory is related with an individual's ability to solve problems, and that autism is a hindrance in this area.<ref name=\"Steele\"/>\n\nAutistic people appear to have a ''local bias'' for visual information processing, that is, a preference for processing local features (details, parts) rather than global features (the whole).<ref name=\"MottronB\"/> One explanation for this local bias is that people with autism do not have the normal [[global precedence]] when looking at objects and scenes.

They also reported that word length effects were greater for the control group. These results are contested by Williams, Happ\u00e9, and Jarrold, who contend that it may be verbal IQ, rather than verbal ability, that is at issue, and Whitehouse et al.'s subjects were not matched on chronological age.

They used a [[Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, Second Edition|WRAML]] (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning) test, a test specifically designed to test memory in children.<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> Test results were similar across all age groups, that significant differences between TD and autistic participants are found only in spatial memory, not verbal working memory.<ref name=\"Boucher\">{{cite book|last=Boucher|first=Jill|title=Memory in Autism|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=132\u2013135|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/davidson/docDetail.action?docID=10235075}}</ref>\n\nGabig et al.<ref name=\"Gabig\"/> discovered that children with autism, regarding verbal working memory and story retelling, performed worse than a control group of TD children.

She places a take-out order but suffers harassment by everyone there except a handsome young cook (David Wakefield) who is also bullied by his co-workers. The salesgirl takes her order, escapes the place and her tormentors, but in her haste leaves her glasses and a food container. The cook retrieves the items and runs after her to the shoe store where she works.\n\nAt the shoe store, the store owner and the senior salesman both shove the salesgirl around, while a customer laughs raucously at her misfortune. The cook dashes into the shop and then to the stock room to return the girl's items. She thanks him shyly, but the owner and the salesman burst in, and heave the cook out of the store. ZZ Top's trademark showcar, the Eliminator, pulls up with the Eliminator girls ([[Jeana Keough|Jeana Tomasino]], [[Kymberly Herrin]], and Dani\u00e8le Arnaud). The Three help the cook to his feet, dust him off, then slip into the shoe store through the back door. The Eliminators find the dejected salesgirl, put her abusers in their place, then present the salesgirl to ZZ Top, who magically appear to bestow her the Eliminator's keys.\n\nThe Three whisk away the salesgirl for a complete makeover: new hairstyle, makeup, and sexy new wardrobe (pink stockings and garters, a matching short skirt, lace-trimmed ankle socks with spike heels). The Eliminator arrives at the burger joint, where the salesgirl debuts her confident new self. She strides into the restaurant with the Eliminator Girls and, with the help of the friendly bikers, uses muscle to keep the more aggressive men at bay. Taking her fella, the cook, by the hand the happy pair leaves the restaurant and ride a dune buggy into the distance. The burger joint's female owner and the rowdy customers watch them leave, sullen over being put in their place. The Eliminator girls invite some of the friendly bikers to join them and the Eliminator drives away as ZZ Top magically appear one last time to wave at the camera.\n\nThis was the third music video directed by Tim Newman.\n\nThe spinning, Furry Dean guitars also premiered in this video.\n\n==Awards==\nThe video won the 1984 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Craig |last= Rosen |title= ZZ Top's 'Legs' and the Women Who Own Them |url= http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/zz-top-legs-women-own-them-210417325.html |publisher= [[Yahoo!

During the final tracking sessions, Terry Manning (final ''Eliminator'' tracking engineer) called Linden Hudson and asked how he did the synth effects for \"Legs\", although Terry could have easily pulled it off if he needed to.\n\nThe single remix of \"Legs\" is much more synthesizer-driven than the album version (although a synthesizer can be heard throughout the latter, it is toned down). There is also a three-note guitar riff heard throughout most of the album version of \"Legs\", and it is a minute longer than the single version.\n\n==Music video==\nThe \"Legs\" video was the third and last of the Eliminator series of videos that introduced the now-iconic 1933 Ford,<ref>{{cite web|title= The ZZ Top Eliminator: Profile of a Hot Rod |publisher= [[HowStuffWorks]] |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/zz-top-eliminator-hot-rod.htm |accessdate= July 30, 2014}}</ref> \"Eliminator girls\", and ZZ Top-as-benevolent-spirits tropes, all of which have become firmly established aspects of the band's iconography. \"Legs\" was important in this regard as it diversified the subject of transformation from man (\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\" and \"Sharp Dressed Man\") to woman.\n\nAfter stepping in a mud puddle and bumping into tough-looking but polite bikers at a crosswalk, a pretty salesgirl (Wendy Frazier) enters a burger joint. She places a take-out order but suffers harassment by everyone there except a handsome young cook (David Wakefield) who is also bullied by his co-workers. The salesgirl takes her order, escapes the place and her tormentors, but in her haste leaves her glasses and a food container. The cook retrieves the items and runs after her to the shoe store where she works.\n\nAt the shoe store, the store owner and the senior salesman both shove the salesgirl around, while a customer laughs raucously at her misfortune. The cook dashes into the shop and then to the stock room to return the girl's items. She thanks him shyly, but the owner and the salesman burst in, and heave the cook out of the store. ZZ Top's trademark showcar, the Eliminator, pulls up with the Eliminator girls ([[Jeana Keough|Jeana Tomasino]], [[Kymberly Herrin]], and Dani\u00e8le Arnaud). The Three help the cook to his feet, dust him off, then slip into the shoe store through the back door. The Eliminators find the dejected salesgirl, put her abusers in their place, then present the salesgirl to ZZ Top, who magically appear to bestow her the Eliminator's keys.\n\nThe Three whisk away the salesgirl for a complete makeover: new hairstyle, makeup, and sexy new wardrobe (pink stockings and garters, a matching short skirt, lace-trimmed ankle socks with spike heels). The Eliminator arrives at the burger joint, where the salesgirl debuts her confident new self. She strides into the restaurant with the Eliminator Girls and, with the help of the friendly bikers, uses muscle to keep the more aggressive men at bay. Taking her fella, the cook, by the hand the happy pair leaves the restaurant and ride a dune buggy into the distance. The burger joint's female owner and the rowdy customers watch them leave, sullen over being put in their place. The Eliminator girls invite some of the friendly bikers to join them and the Eliminator drives away as ZZ Top magically appear one last time to wave at the camera.\n\nThis was the third music video directed by Tim Newman.\n\nThe spinning, Furry Dean guitars also premiered in this video.\n\n==Awards==\nThe video won the 1984 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Craig |last= Rosen |title= ZZ Top's 'Legs' and the Women Who Own Them |url= http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/zz-top-legs-women-own-them-210417325.html |publisher= [[Yahoo!

Sim Sadler and [[Bob Sarles]] edited \"Legs,\" for which both received nominations for Best Editing in the first MTV Video Music Awards, in the Billboard Music Video Awards, and in the American Music Video Awards that year.\n\n==Cover versions==\n*[[Nickelback]] covered the song on the 2011 ''[[ZZ Top: A Tribute from Friends]]''\n*[[Trace Adkins]] covered his version in 2002 on the album ''[[Sharp Dressed Men: A Tribute to ZZ Top]]''.\n*[[Kid Rock]] covered the song on the 2002 album ''[[WWF Forceable Entry]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Sound Tracks |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 16 March 2002 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22legs%22 |volume= 114 |issue= 11 |page= 24 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n==Parodies==\nThe video was parodied in a 1984 episode of ''[[St. Elsewhere]],'' in which ZZ Top themselves, as well as the Eliminator girls appeared. In the scene, hospital orderly Luther ([[Eric Laneuville]]) falls asleep as the radio is playing \"Legs\", and he dreams the Eliminator girls come to his aid, helping him to seek revenge on senior hospital staff who have oppressed him.\n\nOn the May 9, 2017 episode of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', [[Jimmy Fallon|Fallon]] dressed as Dusty Hill, and was joined by guests [[Chris Stapleton]] (as Billy Gibbons) and [[Kevin Bacon]] (as Frank Beard). Imitating ZZ Top, the trio sang a parody of \"Legs\" as \"Neck\" in the show's recurring \"First Drafts of Rock\" segment.

After working at [[Big Huge Games]], [[Raven Software]] and [[BioWare]], Heir co-founded his own studio, Brass Lion Entertainment, in 2017. Heir is known to be outspoken on issues related to [[race and video games|diversity in video games]].\n\n==Career==\nHeir grew up in Maryland and attended college at [[Virginia Tech]], graduating in 2004 with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.<ref name=\"dice bio\"/><ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He interned at [[Big Huge Games]] around 2005<ref name=\"dice bio\"/> before moving to [[Raven Software]], at the time a subsidiary of [[Activision]]. At Raven, he worked for about four and a half years on the 2009 ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' game, initially as a gameplay programmer before moving to be a game designer for the title.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He had been named as lead designer on another unannounced product, prior to a period of financial difficulty at Raven that resulted in Activision ordering multiple layoffs and cancellation of the unannounced project for the studio to focus on support for the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> Heir, while still employed there, was disappointed in Activision's decision to take away any work on new [[intellectual property]] and offload it to [[Bungie]], and decided to quit the company.<ref name=\"heir twitter 2019\"/> Heir subsequently moved to [[BioWare|BioWare Montreal]] around 2010, where he worked as a gameplay designer on ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (2012) and ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"engadget\"/>\n\nHeir stated that, during development of ''Andromeda'', he and other colleagues from the development team attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince the project leads to remove a perceived [[Colonialism|colonialist]] slant to the player's forcible colonization of alien planets.<ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\" /> Heir became the subject of harassment by the [[Gamergate movement]] shortly before the release of ''Andromeda'' in 2017, after they claimed that parts of the game, such as the appearances of female characters, forced a \"liberal agenda\" on players.<ref name=\"mic\"/> An online petition was started to try to have Heir fired from BioWare, though BioWare backed Heir.<ref name=\"mic\"/> However, after the development was completed but before ''Andromeda'' shipped, Heir made the willing choice to leave BioWare, citing that he had become weary over the last twelve years and experiencing [[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]], and grown tired of being told to keep quiet over his concerns about games, as well as being put off by the attitudes from the Gamergate movement.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\"/>\n\n===Brass Lion Entertainment===\nAfter leaving BioWare, Heir spent some months considering his career direction, including the possibility of leaving the video game area altogether. After reflection, he felt empowered to establish a new game development studio to focus on games relating to race and diversity based on his own experiences. He reached out to Bryna Dabby Smith, a former production crew member from [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]] with work on games such as ''[[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]]'', about assisting with the business side of this studio. Word that Heir was establishing a new studio reached Rashad Redic, a game world designer with [[Bethesda Game Studios]] with work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'', who expressed interest in supporting the two.<ref name=\"gi\"/> The three co-founded Brass Lion Entertainment in 2017 after establishing the vision of this studio over phone calls.<ref name=\"vb\"/> Heir had wanted to call the studio Big Mouth Games, reflecting his outspokenness, but found this conflicted with the program ''[[Big Mouth (TV series)|Big Mouth]]'' on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"engadget\"/> Because of the studio vision on diversity, they wanted to be more inclusive in their hiring practices, bringing in minorities and others from underrepresented backgrounds.<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Corner Wolves}}The studio remained quiet over the first two years as they worked out their first title.

Heir struck down past claims that games featuring underrepresented minorities sold fewer than those featuring male and Caucasian characters. He argued that failure to include such characters could perpetuate misogyny and racism to youth, and because video games are built on fantasy rather than realism, developers are free to further inclusion of underrepresented minorities without pressure.

After working at [[Big Huge Games]], [[Raven Software]] and [[BioWare]], Heir co-founded his own studio, Brass Lion Entertainment, in 2017. Heir is known to be outspoken on issues related to [[race and video games|diversity in video games]].\n\n==Career==\nHeir grew up in Maryland and attended college at [[Virginia Tech]], graduating in 2004 with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.<ref name=\"dice bio\"/><ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He interned at [[Big Huge Games]] around 2005<ref name=\"dice bio\"/> before moving to [[Raven Software]], at the time a subsidiary of [[Activision]]. At Raven, he worked for about four and a half years on the 2009 ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' game, initially as a gameplay programmer before moving to be a game designer for the title.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He had been named as lead designer on another unannounced product, prior to a period of financial difficulty at Raven that resulted in Activision ordering multiple layoffs and cancellation of the unannounced project for the studio to focus on support for the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> Heir, while still employed there, was disappointed in Activision's decision to take away any work on new [[intellectual property]] and offload it to [[Bungie]], and decided to quit the company.<ref name=\"heir twitter 2019\"/> Heir subsequently moved to [[BioWare|BioWare Montreal]] around 2010, where he worked as a gameplay designer on ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (2012) and ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"engadget\"/>\n\nHeir stated that, during development of ''Andromeda'', he and other colleagues from the development team attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince the project leads to remove a perceived [[Colonialism|colonialist]] slant to the player's forcible colonization of alien planets.<ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\" /> Heir became the subject of harassment by the [[Gamergate movement]] shortly before the release of ''Andromeda'' in 2017, after they claimed that parts of the game, such as the appearances of female characters, forced a \"liberal agenda\" on players.<ref name=\"mic\"/> An online petition was started to try to have Heir fired from BioWare, though BioWare backed Heir.<ref name=\"mic\"/> However, after the development was completed but before ''Andromeda'' shipped, Heir made the willing choice to leave BioWare, citing that he had become weary over the last twelve years and experiencing [[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]], and grown tired of being told to keep quiet over his concerns about games, as well as being put off by the attitudes from the Gamergate movement.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\"/>\n\n===Brass Lion Entertainment===\nAfter leaving BioWare, Heir spent some months considering his career direction, including the possibility of leaving the video game area altogether. After reflection, he felt empowered to establish a new game development studio to focus on games relating to race and diversity based on his own experiences. He reached out to Bryna Dabby Smith, a former production crew member from [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]] with work on games such as ''[[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]]'', about assisting with the business side of this studio. Word that Heir was establishing a new studio reached Rashad Redic, a game world designer with [[Bethesda Game Studios]] with work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'', who expressed interest in supporting the two.<ref name=\"gi\"/> The three co-founded Brass Lion Entertainment in 2017 after establishing the vision of this studio over phone calls.<ref name=\"vb\"/> Heir had wanted to call the studio Big Mouth Games, reflecting his outspokenness, but found this conflicted with the program ''[[Big Mouth (TV series)|Big Mouth]]'' on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"engadget\"/> Because of the studio vision on diversity, they wanted to be more inclusive in their hiring practices, bringing in minorities and others from underrepresented backgrounds.<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Corner Wolves}}The studio remained quiet over the first two years as they worked out their first title. Heir formally announced the studio in November 2019 along with their first game, ''Corner Wolves'', an action role-playing game set in the 1990s in [[Harlem]] with the protagonist Jacinte as a young [[Afro-Latin Americans|afro-latino]] that is caught in the midst of the [[War on drugs|drug war]] while she searches for her father's killer.<ref name=\"gi\"/> Race is planned to play a major role in the game, with different non-player characters reacting differently to Jacinte.
