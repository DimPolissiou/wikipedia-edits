Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called [[photorespiration]], which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the [[mitochondria]] and [[peroxisomes]] (this is a case of [[Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|metabolite repair]]). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as [[glycine]]. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5.  Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]], [[crassulacean acid metabolism]], and the use of [[pyrenoid]].\n\n===Rate of enzymatic activity===\n[[Image:Calvin-cycle4.svg|thumb|right|300px|Overview of the [[Calvin cycle]] and carbon fixation.]]\n\nSome enzymes can carry out thousands of chemical reactions each second.

Nevertheless, under most conditions, and when light is not otherwise limiting photosynthesis, the speed of RuBisCO responds positively to increasing carbon dioxide concentration.\n\nRuBisCO is usually only active during the day as ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is not regenerated in the dark. This is due to the regulation of several other enzymes in the Calvin cycle. In addition, the activity of RuBisCO is coordinated with that of the other enzymes of the Calvin cycle in several ways.\n\n===By ions===\nUpon illumination of the chloroplasts, the [[pH]] of the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]] rises from 7.0 to 8.0 because of the proton (hydrogen ion, {{Chem|H|+}}) gradient created across the [[thylakoid]] membrane.  The movement of protons into thylakoids is [[Light-dependent reaction|driven by light]] and is fundamental to [[ATP synthase#Plant ATP synthase|ATP synthesis]] in chloroplasts. At the same time, magnesium ions ({{Chem|Mg|2+}}) move out of the thylakoids, increasing the concentration of magnesium in the stroma of the chloroplasts. RuBisCO has a high optimal pH (can be >9.0, depending on the magnesium ion concentration) and, thus, becomes \"activated\" by the addition of carbon dioxide and magnesium to the active sites as described above.\n\n===By RuBisCO activase===\nIn plants and some algae, another enzyme, '''RuBisCO activase''' (Rca, {{GO|GO:0046863}}, {{UniProt|P10896}}), is required to allow the rapid formation of the critical [[carbamate]] in the active site of RuBisCO.<ref name=\"pmid16245090\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Portis AR | title = Rubisco activase - Rubisco's catalytic chaperone | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 11\u201327 | year = 2003 | pmid = 16245090 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022458108678 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15236471\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin SH, Jiang DA, Li XQ, Sun JW | title = Characteristics of photosynthesis in rice plants transformed with an antisense Rubisco activase gene | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University Science | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 897\u20139 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15236471 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.2004.0897 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f8af66ec94a48a27feab9f05b5cb8b59fbe7634 }}</ref> RuBisCO activase is required because the [[ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]] (RuBP) substrate binds more strongly to the active sites when the carbamate present and markedly slows down the \"activation\" process.

Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation ([[redox]]) state through another small regulatory protein, [[thioredoxin]].

Several times during the evolution of plants, mechanisms have evolved for increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the stroma (see [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]]). The use of oxygen as a substrate appears to be a puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy. However, it may be a mechanism for preventing overload during periods of high light flux.  This weakness in the enzyme is the cause of photorespiration, such that healthy leaves in bright light may have zero net carbon fixation when the ratio of {{Chem|O|2}} to {{CO2}} reaches a threshold at which oxygen is fixed instead of carbon. This phenomenon is primarily temperature-dependent. High temperature decreases the concentration of {{CO2}} dissolved in the moisture in the leaf tissues.  This phenomenon is also related to [[Water scarcity|water stress]]. Since plant leaves are evaporatively cooled, limited water causes high leaf temperatures. {{C4}} plants use the enzyme [[C4 carbon fixation|PEP carboxylase]] initially, which has a higher affinity for {{CO2}}. The process first makes a 4-carbon intermediate compound, which is shuttled into a site of {{C3}} photosynthesis then de-carboxylated, releasing {{CO2}} to boost the concentration of {{CO2}}, hence the name {{C4}} plants.\n\n[[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) plants keep their [[stoma]]ta closed during the day, which conserves water but prevents the light-independent reactions (a.k.a. the [[Calvin Cycle]]) from taking place, since these reactions require {{CO2}} to pass by gas exchange through these openings. Evaporation through the upper side of a leaf is prevented by a layer of [[wax]].\n\n== Genetic engineering ==\n\nSince RuBisCO is often rate-limiting for photosynthesis in plants, it may be possible to improve [[photosynthetic efficiency]] by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase catalytic activity and/or decrease oxygenation rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME | title = Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 53 | pages = 449\u201375 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12221984 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/437c9700bdb4b82bee7c40f78b7619a1bda377d1 }}</ref><ref name=\"John_Timmer_2017\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/key-plant-proteins-that-grab-co%e2%82%82-finally-made-in-bacteria/|last=Timmer|first= John|title=We may now be able to engineer the most important lousy enzyme on the planet|date=7 December 2017|work=Ars Technica|access-date=5 January 2019|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"John_Timmer_2019\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/re-engineering-photosynthesis-gives-plants-a-40-growth-boost/|last=Timmer|first=John|title=Fixing photosynthesis by engineering it to recycle a toxic mistake|date=3 January 2019|work=Ars Technica|access-date=5 January 2019|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"SouthCavanagh2019\">{{cite journal | vauthors = South PF, Cavanagh AP, Liu HW, Ort DR | title = Synthetic glycolate metabolism pathways stimulate crop growth and productivity in the field | journal = Science | volume = 363 | issue = 6422 | pages = eaat9077 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30606819 | doi = 10.1126/science.aat9077 }}</ref> This could improve [[biosequestration]] of {{CO2}} and be both an important [[climate change]] strategy and a strategy to increase crop yields.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Furbank RT, Quick WP, Sirault XR |title=Improving photosynthesis and yield potential in cereal crops by targeted genetic manipulation: Prospects, progress and challenges|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=182|pages=19\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2015.04.009|year=2015}}</ref> Approaches under investigation include transferring RuBisCO genes from one organism into another organism, engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into temperature sensitive plants, increasing the level of expression of RuBisCO subunits, expressing RuBisCO small chains from the [[plastome|chloroplast DNA]], and altering RuBisCO genes to increase specificity for carbon dioxide or otherwise increase the rate of carbon fixation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parry MA, Andralojc PJ, Mitchell RA, Madgwick PJ, Keys AJ | title = Manipulation of Rubisco: the amount, activity, function and regulation | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 54 | issue = 386 | pages = 1321\u201333 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12709478 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erg141 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12709478 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogbaga CC, Stepien P, Athar HU, Ashraf M | title = Engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into high-temperature sensitive plants | journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 559\u2013572 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 28937283 | doi = 10.1080/07388551.2017.1378998 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mutagenesis in plants ===\nIn general, [[site-directed mutagenesis]] of RuBisCO has been mostly unsuccessful,<ref name=\":0\" /> though mutated forms of the protein have been achieved in tobacco plants with subunit C<sub>4</sub> species,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitney SM, Sharwood RE, Orr D, White SJ, Alonso H, Galm\u00e9s J | title = Isoleucine 309 acts as a C4 catalytic switch that increases ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) carboxylation rate in Flaveria | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 35 | pages = 14688\u201393 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21849620 | pmc = 3167554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1109503108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10814688W }}</ref> and a RuBisCO with more C<sub>4</sub>-like kinetic characteristics have been attained in rice via nuclear transformation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishikawa C, Hatanaka T, Misoo S, Miyake C, Fukayama H | title = Functional incorporation of sorghum small subunit increases the catalytic turnover rate of Rubisco in transgenic rice | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 156 | issue = 3 | pages = 1603\u201311 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21562335 | pmc = 3135941 | doi = 10.1104/pp.111.177030 }}</ref>\n\nOne avenue is to introduce RuBisCO variants with naturally high specificity values such as the ones from the [[red alga]] ''Galdieria partita'' into plants.

This reaction is inhibited by the presence of [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and, thus, activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation ([[redox]]) state through another small regulatory protein, [[thioredoxin]]. In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of RuBisCO can be modulated in response to light intensity and, thus, the rate of formation of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang N, Kallis RP, Ewy RG, Portis AR | title = Light modulation of Rubisco in Arabidopsis requires a capacity for redox regulation of the larger Rubisco activase isoform | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 3330\u20134 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11854454 | pmc = 122518 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.042529999 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.3330Z }}</ref>\n\n===By phosphate===\nIn cyanobacteria, inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) participates in the co-ordinated regulation of photosynthesis.

Several times during the evolution of plants, mechanisms have evolved for increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the stroma (see [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]]). The use of oxygen as a substrate appears to be a puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy. However, it may be a mechanism for preventing overload during periods of high light flux.  This weakness in the enzyme is the cause of photorespiration, such that healthy leaves in bright light may have zero net carbon fixation when the ratio of {{Chem|O|2}} to {{CO2}} reaches a threshold at which oxygen is fixed instead of carbon. This phenomenon is primarily temperature-dependent. High temperature decreases the concentration of {{CO2}} dissolved in the moisture in the leaf tissues.  This phenomenon is also related to [[Water scarcity|water stress]]. Since plant leaves are evaporatively cooled, limited water causes high leaf temperatures. {{C4}} plants use the enzyme [[C4 carbon fixation|PEP carboxylase]] initially, which has a higher affinity for {{CO2}}. The process first makes a 4-carbon intermediate compound, which is shuttled into a site of {{C3}} photosynthesis then de-carboxylated, releasing {{CO2}} to boost the concentration of {{CO2}}, hence the name {{C4}} plants.\n\n[[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) plants keep their [[stoma]]ta closed during the day, which conserves water but prevents the light-independent reactions (a.k.a. the [[Calvin Cycle]]) from taking place, since these reactions require {{CO2}} to pass by gas exchange through these openings. Evaporation through the upper side of a leaf is prevented by a layer of [[wax]].\n\n== Genetic engineering ==\n\nSince RuBisCO is often rate-limiting for photosynthesis in plants, it may be possible to improve [[photosynthetic efficiency]] by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase catalytic activity and/or decrease oxygenation rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME | title = Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 53 | pages = 449\u201375 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12221984 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/437c9700bdb4b82bee7c40f78b7619a1bda377d1 }}</ref><ref name=\"John_Timmer_2017\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/key-plant-proteins-that-grab-co%e2%82%82-finally-made-in-bacteria/|last=Timmer|first= John|title=We may now be able to engineer the most important lousy enzyme on the planet|date=7 December 2017|work=Ars Technica|access-date=5 January 2019|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"John_Timmer_2019\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/re-engineering-photosynthesis-gives-plants-a-40-growth-boost/|last=Timmer|first=John|title=Fixing photosynthesis by engineering it to recycle a toxic mistake|date=3 January 2019|work=Ars Technica|access-date=5 January 2019|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"SouthCavanagh2019\">{{cite journal | vauthors = South PF, Cavanagh AP, Liu HW, Ort DR | title = Synthetic glycolate metabolism pathways stimulate crop growth and productivity in the field | journal = Science | volume = 363 | issue = 6422 | pages = eaat9077 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30606819 | doi = 10.1126/science.aat9077 }}</ref> This could improve [[biosequestration]] of {{CO2}} and be both an important [[climate change]] strategy and a strategy to increase crop yields.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Furbank RT, Quick WP, Sirault XR |title=Improving photosynthesis and yield potential in cereal crops by targeted genetic manipulation: Prospects, progress and challenges|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=182|pages=19\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2015.04.009|year=2015}}</ref> Approaches under investigation include transferring RuBisCO genes from one organism into another organism, engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into temperature sensitive plants, increasing the level of expression of RuBisCO subunits, expressing RuBisCO small chains from the [[plastome|chloroplast DNA]], and altering RuBisCO genes to increase specificity for carbon dioxide or otherwise increase the rate of carbon fixation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parry MA, Andralojc PJ, Mitchell RA, Madgwick PJ, Keys AJ | title = Manipulation of Rubisco: the amount, activity, function and regulation | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 54 | issue = 386 | pages = 1321\u201333 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12709478 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erg141 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12709478 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogbaga CC, Stepien P, Athar HU, Ashraf M | title = Engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into high-temperature sensitive plants | journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 559\u2013572 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 28937283 | doi = 10.1080/07388551.2017.1378998 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mutagenesis in plants ===\nIn general, [[site-directed mutagenesis]] of RuBisCO has been mostly unsuccessful,<ref name=\":0\" /> though mutated forms of the protein have been achieved in tobacco plants with subunit C<sub>4</sub> species,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitney SM, Sharwood RE, Orr D, White SJ, Alonso H, Galm\u00e9s J | title = Isoleucine 309 acts as a C4 catalytic switch that increases ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) carboxylation rate in Flaveria | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 35 | pages = 14688\u201393 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21849620 | pmc = 3167554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1109503108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10814688W }}</ref> and a RuBisCO with more C<sub>4</sub>-like kinetic characteristics have been attained in rice via nuclear transformation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishikawa C, Hatanaka T, Misoo S, Miyake C, Fukayama H | title = Functional incorporation of sorghum small subunit increases the catalytic turnover rate of Rubisco in transgenic rice | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 156 | issue = 3 | pages = 1603\u201311 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21562335 | pmc = 3135941 | doi = 10.1104/pp.111.177030 }}</ref>\n\nOne avenue is to introduce RuBisCO variants with naturally high specificity values such as the ones from the [[red alga]] ''Galdieria partita'' into plants.

The destabilizing C<sub>4</sub> mutations on RuBisCO has been sustained by environmental pressures such as low {{CO2}} concentrations, requiring a sacrifice of stability for new adaptive functions.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==History of the term==\nThe term \"RuBisCO\" was coined humorously in 1979, by [[David Eisenberg]] at a seminar honouring the retirement of the early, prominent RuBisCO researcher, [[Sam Wildman]], and also alluded to the snack food trade name \"[[Nabisco]]\" in reference to Wildman's attempts to create an edible protein supplement from tobacco leaves.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wildman SG | title = Along the trail from Fraction I protein to Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 73 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 243\u201350 | year = 2002 | pmid = 16245127 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020467601966 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Portis AR, Parry MA | title = Discoveries in Rubisco (Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase): a historical perspective | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u201343 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17665149 | doi = 10.1007/s11120-007-9225-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe capitalization of the name has been long debated. It can be capitalized for each letter of the full name ('''R'''ib'''u'''lose-1,5 '''bis'''phosphate '''c'''arboxylase/'''o'''xgenase), but it has also been argued that is should all be in lower case (rubisco), similar to other terms like scuba or laser.  \n\n== See also ==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Carbon cycle]]\n*[[Photorespiration]]\n*[[Pyrenoid]]\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n*[[C4 carbon fixation]]\n*[[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]/CAM photosynthesis\n*[[Carboxysome]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n[[Image:RuBisCOL2S2.png|thumb|right|''Figure 3''.
