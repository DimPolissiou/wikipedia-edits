Also in 1948, Dameron led his own group in New York, which included [[Fats Navarro]]; the following year Dameron was at the Paris Jazz Festival with [[Miles Davis]]. From 1961 he scored for recordings by [[Milt Jackson]], [[Sonny Stitt]], and [[Blue Mitchell]].<ref>Harrison, Max. \"Dameron, Tadd.\" [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/07122 Grove Music Online]. Oxford Music Online. April 2, 2011.</ref>\n\nDameron also arranged and played for [[rhythm and blues]] musician [[Bull Moose Jackson]]. Playing for Jackson at that same time was [[Benny Golson]], who was to become a jazz composer in his own right. Golson has said that Dameron was the most important influence on his writing.\n\nDameron composed several bop and swing [[jazz standard|standards]], including \"[[Hot House (composition)|Hot House]]\", \"If You Could See Me Now\", \"[[Our Delight]]\", \"[[Good Bait]]\" (composed for [[Count Basie]])<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/> and \"[[Lady Bird (composition)|Lady Bird]]\". Dameron's bands from the late 1940s and early 1950s featured leading players such as Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Wardell Gray]], and [[Clifford Brown]].  In 1956 he led two sessions based on his compositions, released as the 1956 album \"[[Fontainebleau (album)|Fontainebleau]]\" and the 1957 album \"[[Mating Call]].\" The latter featured [[John Coltrane]].  Dameron developed an addiction to narcotics toward the end of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1957 and 1958, and served time (1959\u201360) in a federal prison hospital in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. After his release, Dameron recorded a single notable project as a leader, [[The Magic Touch (Tadd Dameron album)|The Magic Touch]], but was sidelined by health problems; he had several [[heart attack]]s before dying of cancer in 1965, at the age of 48. He was buried at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/117063856/|title=Funeral Rites for Jazz Arranger Feature His Own Compositions|date=March 12, 1965|website=[[Ancestry.com|newspapers.com]]|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tributes==\n* In the 1980s drummer [[Philly Joe Jones]] and trumpeter [[Don Sickler]] founded [[Dameronia]], a band which performed the music of Tadd Dameron.<ref name=\"CarrFairweather2004\">{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Ian |last2=Fairweather |first2=Digby |last3=Priestley |first3=Brian |title=The Rough Guide to Jazz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5wrGL-a-Q8C&pg=RA5-PT23e |accessdate=22 March 2020 |year=2004 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-1-84353-256-9 |pages=5\u2013}}</ref>\n\n* Saxophonist [[Dexter Gordon]] called him the \"romanticist\" of the bop movement.<ref name=\"Nisenson\">{{cite web |last1=Nisenson |first1=Eric |title='Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis |url=https://archive.org/details/roundaboutmidnig0000nise/page/65 |website=archive.org |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n* Music critic [[Scott Yanow]] called Dameron the \"definitive arranger/composer of the [[bop era]]\".<ref name=\"Yanow1\">{{cite web |last1=Yanow |first1=Scott |title=Tadd Dameron |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tadd-dameron-mn0000016759/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n===As leader/co-leader===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Recorded\n!Released\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1948?\n|\n|''The Dameron Band (Featuring Fats Navarro)''\n|[[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]]\n|\n|-\n|1949?\n|1972\n|''Anthropology''\n|[[Spotlite Records|Spotlite]]\n|\n|-\n|1949?\n|\n|''Cool Boppin' ''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1949?\n|1977\n|''The Miles Davis and Dameron Quartet in Paris \u2013 Festival International du Jazz, May 1949''\n|[[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n|\n|-\n|1953\n|1953\n|''A Study in Dameronia''\n|[[Prestige Records|Prestige]]\n|With [[Clifford Brown]] (trumpet), [[Benny Golson]] (tenor sax), [[Idrees Sulieman]] (trumpet), [[Gigi Gryce]] (alto sax), Herb Mullins (trombone), Oscar Estell (baritone sax), [[Percy Heath]] (bass), [[Philly Joe Jones]] (drums);

Also in 1948, Dameron led his own group in New York, which included [[Fats Navarro]]; the following year Dameron was at the Paris Jazz Festival with [[Miles Davis]]. From 1961 he scored for recordings by [[Milt Jackson]], [[Sonny Stitt]], and [[Blue Mitchell]].<ref>Harrison, Max. \"Dameron, Tadd.\" [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/07122 Grove Music Online]. Oxford Music Online. April 2, 2011.</ref>\n\nDameron also arranged and played for [[rhythm and blues]] musician [[Bull Moose Jackson]]. Playing for Jackson at that same time was [[Benny Golson]], who was to become a jazz composer in his own right. Golson has said that Dameron was the most important influence on his writing.\n\nDameron composed several bop and swing [[jazz standard|standards]], including \"[[Hot House (composition)|Hot House]]\", \"If You Could See Me Now\", \"[[Our Delight]]\", \"[[Good Bait]]\" (composed for [[Count Basie]])<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/> and \"[[Lady Bird (composition)|Lady Bird]]\". Dameron's bands from the late 1940s and early 1950s featured leading players such as Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Wardell Gray]], and [[Clifford Brown]].  In 1956 he led two sessions based on his compositions, released as the 1956 album \"[[Fontainebleau (album)|Fontainebleau]]\" and the 1957 album \"[[Mating Call]].\" The latter featured [[John Coltrane]].  Dameron developed an addiction to narcotics toward the end of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1957 and 1958, and served time (1959\u201360) in a federal prison hospital in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. After his release, Dameron recorded a single notable project as a leader, [[The Magic Touch (Tadd Dameron album)|The Magic Touch]], but was sidelined by health problems; he had several [[heart attack]]s before dying of cancer in 1965, at the age of 48.

The wheel is rolling to the left at constant speed.) Note that '''''R''''' is the resultant force from non-uniform pressure at the wheel-roadbed contact surface. This pressure is greater towards the front of the wheel due to hysteresis.]]\n\n'''Rolling resistance''', sometimes called '''rolling friction''' or '''rolling drag''', is the force resisting the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] when a body (such as a [[ball]], [[tire]], or [[wheel]]) rolls on a surface. It is mainly caused by [[Plasticity (physics)|non-elastic]] effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc., is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are [[hysteresis]] losses (see [[rolling resistance#Primary cause|below]]), and permanent [[plastic deformation|(plastic) deformation]] of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the [[frictional contact mechanics|slippage]] between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves [[friction]], therefore the name \"rolling friction\" is to an extent a misnomer.\n\nIn analogy with [[sliding friction]], rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.<ref name=\"Peck\">{{cite book\n| last = Peck\n| first = William Guy\n| year = 1859\n| url = https://archive.org/details/elementsmechani02peckgoog\n| quote = rolling friction less than sliding friction.\n| title = Elements of Mechanics: For the Use of Colleges, Academies, and High Schools\n| publisher = A.S.

Factors that contribute to rolling resistance are the (amount of) deformation of the wheels, the deformation of the roadbed surface, and movement below the surface. Additional contributing factors include [[#Dependence on diameter|wheel diameter]],<ref name = \"Hibbeler\">{{cite book\n| title = Engineering Mechanics: Statics & Dynamics\n| edition = Eleventh\n| last = Hibbeler\n| first = R.C.\n| year = 2007\n| pages = 441\u2013442\n| publisher = Pearson, Prentice Hall\n}}</ref> [[#Dependence on wheel load|load on wheel]], surface adhesion, sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to [[hysteresis]] also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a [[tire|rubber tire]] will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a [[steel]] [[Wheelset (rail transport)|railroad wheel]] on a steel rail. Also, [[sand]] on the ground will give more rolling resistance than [[concrete]]. Sole rolling resistance factor is not dependent on speed.\n\n==Primary cause==\n[[File:Pressure distribution for viscoelastic rolling cylinders.png|thumb|Asymmetrical pressure distribution between rolling cylinders due to viscoelastic material behavior (rolling to the right).<ref name = \"CONTACT\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kalkersoftware.org/downloads/user-guide.pdf\n| title = User guide for CONTACT, Rolling and sliding contact with friction.

The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the rubber.\n:\u2014 National Academy of Sciences<ref name = \"NAS286\">{{cite web\n| url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf\n| title = Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286. National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006\n| accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.\n\nThe resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The [[line of action]] of the (aggregate) [[Force#Normal force|vertical force]] no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a [[moment (physics)|moment]] occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.\n\nMaterials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. [[Low rolling resistance tires]] typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.<ref>[http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres Tyres-Online: The Benefits of Silica in Tyre Design<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204065301/http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres |date=2013-02-04 }}</ref> Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p.85</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the broad sense, specific \"rolling resistance\" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words, the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed.<ref>An example of such usage for railroads is [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf here].</ref> This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).\n\nBut there is an even broader sense that would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the [[#Depends on applied torque|torque applied from the engine]]. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power is equal to force times velocity]] and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.\n\nThe pure \"rolling resistance\" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p. 79. Hay, p. 68</ref> For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called \"rolling resistance\". In the broad sense, \"rolling resistance\" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum \"rolling resistance\" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Chapt. IV, p. 73+; \u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, Sect. 5.2 p. 78+; Hay, Chapt. 6 \"Train Resistance\" p. 67+</ref>\n\nSince railroad rolling resistance in the broad sense may be a few times larger than just the pure rolling resistance<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p. 107</ref> reported values may be in serious conflict since they may be based on different definitions of \"rolling resistance\". The train's engines must, of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.\n\nFor tires, rolling resistance is defined as the energy consumed by a tire per unit distance covered. It is also called rolling friction or rolling drag. It is one of the forces that act to oppose the motion of a driver. The main reason for this is that when the tires are in motion and touch the surface, the surface changes shape and causes deformation of the tire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|title=Rolling Resistance and Fuel Saving|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408115014/http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nFor highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipated in shaking the roadway (and the earth beneath it), the shaking of the vehicle itself, and the sliding of the tires. But, other than the [[#Depends on applied torque|additional power required due to torque]] and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the \"pure\" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.<ref>If one were to assume that the resistance coefficients (Crr) for motor vehicles were the same as for trains, then for trains the neglected resistances taken together have a Crr of about 0.0004 (see \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p.107 at 20km/hr and assume a total Crr =0.0010 based on Fig. 3.8, p.50 (plain bearings) and adjust for roller bearings based on a delta Crr of 0.00035 as read from Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 on pp. 74, 76). Compare this Crr of 0.0004 to motor vehicle tire Crr's of at least 10 times higher per \"Rolling resistance coefficient examples\" in this article</ref>\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient==\nThe \"rolling resistance coefficient\" is defined by the following equation:<ref name = \"NAS286\" />\n:<math>\\ F = C_{rr} N </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown as <math>R</math> in figure 1),\n:: <math>C_{rr}</math> is the dimensionless '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' ('''CRF'''), and\n:: <math>N</math> is the [[normal force]], the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.\n\n<math>C_{rr}</math> is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.01 </math> means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 1000 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that <math>C_{rr}</math> is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, <math>C_{rr}</math> is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. <math>C_{rr}</math> is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000&nbsp;kg ),<ref>kgf/tonne is used by \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 throughout his book</ref> which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds\nof load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just <math>2000 C_{rr}</math>. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all \"specific resistances\", sometimes they are just called \"resistance\" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that <math>C_{rr}</math> is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is <math>1000 g C_{rr}</math> and is force per unit mass, where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 uses N/T notation. See pp. 78-84.</ref>\n\nThe above shows resistance proportional to <math> C_{rr}</math> but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, [[#Dependence on wheel load|loads]], [[#Dependence on applied torque|torque]], surface roughness, [[#Dependence on diameter|diameter]], tire inflation/wear, etc., because <math>C_{rr}</math> itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of <math> C_{rr}</math> that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but [[#Dependence on wheel load|it is not]].\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.\n\n#\"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.\"<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm|title=Roller Data|last=Willett|first=Kraig|website=www.biketechreview.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with [[coast-down test]]s. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.\n#The coefficient of rolling resistance ''b'', which has the dimension of [[length]], is approximately (due to the [[small-angle approximation]] of <math>\\cos(\\theta) = 1</math>) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the [[radius]] of the wheel divided by the wheel load.<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n# [[ISO 18164:2005]] is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.\n\nThe results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize \"comfort\" and \"performance\".\n\n==Physical formulae==\nThe coefficient of rolling resistance for a slow rigid wheel on a perfectly elastic surface, not adjusted for velocity, can be calculated by {{cn|date=September 2018}}\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = \\sqrt {z/d} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>z</math> is the sinkage depth\n:: <math>d</math> is the diameter of the rigid wheel \n\nEmpirical formula for <math>\\ C_{rr} </math> for cast iron mine car wheels on steel rails.<ref>Hersey, equation (2), p. 83</ref>\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.0048 (18/D)^{\\frac{1}{2}}(100/W)^{\\frac{1}{4}} </math>\n:where\n::<math>D</math> is the wheel diameter in in.\n::<math>W</math> is the load on the wheel in lbs.\n\nAs an alternative to using [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|<math>\\ C_{rr}</math>]] one can use <math>\\ b</math>, which is a different '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length. It is defined by the following formula:<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n:<math>\\ F = \\frac{N b}{r} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),\n:: <math>r</math> is the wheel radius,\n:: <math>b</math> is the '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length, and\n:: <math>N</math> is the normal force (equal to ''W'', not ''R'', as shown in figure 1).\n\nThe above equation, where resistance is inversely proportional to radius r. seems to be based on the discredited \"Coulomb's law\" (Neither Coulomb's inverse square law nor Coulomb's law of friction) (needs citation). See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]]. Equating this equation with the force per the [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|rolling resistance coefficient]], and solving for b, gives b = C<sub>rr</sub>\u00b7r. Therefore, if a source gives rolling resistance coefficient (C<sub>rr</sub>) as a dimensionless coefficient, it can be converted to b, having units of length, by multiplying C<sub>rr</sub> by wheel radius r.\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient examples==\n\nTable of rolling resistance coefficient examples: [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tire4.htm]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n|'''''C'''''<sub>''rr''</sub> ||'''''b'''''|| '''Description'''\n|-\n| 0.0003 ''to'' 0.0004<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 81.</ref>|| ||[[#Definitions|\"Pure rolling resistance\"]] Railroad steel wheel on steel rail\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0015<ref>{{cite web|title=Coefficients of Friction in Bearing|url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/cof.htm|work=Coefficients of Friction|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>\n|| 0.1&nbsp;mm<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />||Hardened steel ball bearings on steel\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0024<ref>Hay, Fig. 6-2 p.72(worst case shown of 0.0036 not used since it is likely erroneous)</ref><ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55; Figs. 2.3, 2.4 pp. 35-36.

In some laboratory tests, however, such as [http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)], smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of [[Soap Box Derby|ultimate speed]] soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for. See [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}#Pneumatic tires, effect of diameter|talk page]].</ref>\n\n==Dependence on applied torque==\n\nThe driving [[torque]] <math>T</math> to overcome rolling resistance <math>R_{r}</math> and maintain steady speed on level ground (with no air resistance) can be calculated by:\n:<math> T = \\frac{V_{s}}{\\Omega} R_r </math>\n:where\n:: <math>V_s</math> is the linear speed of the body (at the axle), and\n:: <math>\\Omega</math> its rotational speed.\nIt is noteworthy that <math>V_{s}/\\Omega</math> is usually not equal to the radius of the rolling body.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.020|lay-url=http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/rollingresistance/|title=Three-dimensional boundary element formulation of an incompressible viscoelastic layer of finite thickness applied to the rolling resistance of a rigid sphere|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=833\u2013842|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.021|title= Simple algorithms for solving steady-state frictional rolling contact problems in two and three dimensions|journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume= 50|issue= 6|pages= 843\u2013852|year= 2013|last1= Z\u00e9hil|first1= G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2= Gavin|first2= Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.09.025|title=Simplified approaches to viscoelastic rolling resistance|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=853\u2013862|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref>\n\n===All wheels===\n\"Applied torque\" may either be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]) or a braking torque applied by [[brake]]s (including [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.\n\nA small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.<ref name=Roberts-torque/> This is partly because the [[tractive force]] applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power]] = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nIn order to apply any [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p.30 including eq. (2.7) and Fig. 2.3</ref> For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.\n\nSlip (also known as [[Rail adhesion#Forces on wheels|creep]]) is normally roughly directly proportional to [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye\u2014the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nRolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).<ref name=Roberts-torque>Roberts, Fig. 17: \"Effect of torque transmission on rolling resistance\", p. 71</ref> This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.\n\n==Dependence on wheel load==\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nThe rolling resistance coefficient, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf].\n were claiming about the same value as \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432</ref> For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same \"economy of scale\" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.<ref>Hersey, Table 6., p. 267</ref> The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.<ref name=Williams />\n\nIf Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.<ref>Per this assumption, <math>F=k N^{0.5}</math> where <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force and <math>N</math> is the normal load force on the wheel due to vehicle weight, and <math>k</math> is a constant. It can be readily shown by differentiation of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>N</math> using [[Differentiation rules#The polynomial or elementary power rule|this rule]] that <math>{\\operatorname{d}N\\over N}=2{\\operatorname{d}F\\over F}</math></ref>\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nFor pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (rolling resistance coefficient) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 60-61.</ref> It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) \"schedule\", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.\n\n==Dependence on curvature of roadway==\n\n===General===\nWhen a vehicle ([[motor vehicle]] or railroad [[train]]) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not [[Banked curve#Frictionless banked curve|banked]] so as to exactly counter the [[centrifugal force]] with an equal and opposing [[centripetal force]] due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle.\nThis will result in increased rolling resistance. [[Banked curve|Banking]] is also known as [[Cant (road/rail)|\"superelevation\" or \"cant\"]] (not to be confused with [[Cant (road/rail)#Rail|rail cant]] of a [[Track (rail transport)#Rail|rail]]). For railroads, this is called [[curve resistance]] but for [[road]]s it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to [[Cornering force|cornering]].\n\n==Sound effects==\nRolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[roadway]], a process which generates [[roadway noise|sound]] as a by-product.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00159677] C. Michael Hogan, ''Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973</ref> The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.<ref>Gwidon W.

The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silica\u2013silane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.<ref>http://144.206.159.178/ft/200/607426/12614863.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.<ref>http://www.rubberchemtechnol.org/resource/1/rctea4/v3/i1/p19_s1?isAuthorized=no{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire<ref name = \"schwalbe\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance\n| title = Schwalbe Tires: Rolling Resistance}}</ref> For example, at the same pressure, wider [[bicycle tire]]s flex less in the sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/>  \n* Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of the sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous [[Ford Explorer]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|rollover accidents]].\n* Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a \"fuel saving\" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a \"fuel saving\" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.\n* In tires, [[Tire tread|tread]] thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> Thus, the \"fastest\" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.\n* Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]].\n* Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.\n* Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)<ref>[http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/other/Crr.html The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>U.S National Bureau of Standards p.? and Williams p.?</ref> For a rise in temperature from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.<ref>Roberts, \"Effect of temperature\", p.59</ref> It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.\n\n==Railroads: Components of rolling resistance==\nIn a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 74, Although \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 list these components, he doesn't give the sum a name.</ref>): \n# Wheel bearing torque losses. \n# Pure rolling resistance.\n# Sliding of the wheel on the rail.\n# Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth). \n# Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.\n\nWheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|Crr]].

For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60&nbsp;km/h but at a low speed of 20&nbsp;km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120&nbsp;km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.\n\n==Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains==\nThe rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.\n\nAs an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975, Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,<ref name=rr_stat>Statistics of railroads of class I in the United States, Years 1965 to 1975: Statistical summary.

This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.\n\nAn example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne. This lighter weight per passenger, combined with the lower rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail means that an N700 Shinkansen is much more energy efficient than a typical automobile.\n\nIn the case of freight, CSX ran an advertisement campaign in 2013 claiming that their freight trains move \"a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel\", whereas some sources claim trucks move a ton of freight about 130 miles per gallon of fuel, indicating trains are more efficient overall.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coefficient of friction]]\n* [[Low-rolling resistance tires]]\n* [[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]] ([[Magnetic]] [[Levitation]], the elimination of rolling and thus rolling resistance)\n* [[Rolling element bearing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n*\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 \u041f.\u041d. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0421\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\" (Resistance to motion of railway rolling stock) \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0426\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041c\u041f\u0421 (ISSN 0372-3305). \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 311 (Vol. 311). - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1966. \u2013 178 pp. [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b12003170~S1 perm. record at UC Berkeley] (In 2012, full text was on the Internet but the U.S. was blocked)\n*\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0412.\u0412., \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0410., \u0410\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0421. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0422\u044f\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432\" (Traction of trains) \u0423\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435. - \u041c.: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1987. - 264 pp.\n*Hay, William W. \"Railroad Engineering\" New York, Wiley 1953\n*[[Mayo D.

It is mainly caused by [[Plasticity (physics)|non-elastic]] effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc., is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are [[hysteresis]] losses (see [[rolling resistance#Primary cause|below]]), and permanent [[plastic deformation|(plastic) deformation]] of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the [[frictional contact mechanics|slippage]] between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves [[friction]], therefore the name \"rolling friction\" is to an extent a misnomer.\n\nIn analogy with [[sliding friction]], rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.<ref name=\"Peck\">{{cite book\n| last = Peck\n| first = William Guy\n| year = 1859\n| url = https://archive.org/details/elementsmechani02peckgoog\n| quote = rolling friction less than sliding friction.\n| title = Elements of Mechanics: For the Use of Colleges, Academies, and High Schools\n| publisher = A.S.

The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the rubber.\n:\u2014 National Academy of Sciences<ref name = \"NAS286\">{{cite web\n| url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf\n| title = Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286. National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006\n| accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.\n\nThe resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The [[line of action]] of the (aggregate) [[Force#Normal force|vertical force]] no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a [[moment (physics)|moment]] occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.\n\nMaterials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. [[Low rolling resistance tires]] typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.<ref>[http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres Tyres-Online: The Benefits of Silica in Tyre Design<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204065301/http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres |date=2013-02-04 }}</ref> Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p.85</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the broad sense, specific \"rolling resistance\" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words, the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed.<ref>An example of such usage for railroads is [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf here].</ref> This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).\n\nBut there is an even broader sense that would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the [[#Depends on applied torque|torque applied from the engine]]. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power is equal to force times velocity]] and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.\n\nThe pure \"rolling resistance\" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p. 79. Hay, p. 68</ref> For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called \"rolling resistance\". In the broad sense, \"rolling resistance\" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum \"rolling resistance\" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Chapt.

The train's engines must, of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.\n\nFor tires, rolling resistance is defined as the energy consumed by a tire per unit distance covered. It is also called rolling friction or rolling drag. It is one of the forces that act to oppose the motion of a driver. The main reason for this is that when the tires are in motion and touch the surface, the surface changes shape and causes deformation of the tire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|title=Rolling Resistance and Fuel Saving|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408115014/http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nFor highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipated in shaking the roadway (and the earth beneath it), the shaking of the vehicle itself, and the sliding of the tires. But, other than the [[#Depends on applied torque|additional power required due to torque]] and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the \"pure\" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.<ref>If one were to assume that the resistance coefficients (Crr) for motor vehicles were the same as for trains, then for trains the neglected resistances taken together have a Crr of about 0.0004 (see \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p.107 at 20km/hr and assume a total Crr =0.0010 based on Fig. 3.8, p.50 (plain bearings) and adjust for roller bearings based on a delta Crr of 0.00035 as read from Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 on pp. 74, 76). Compare this Crr of 0.0004 to motor vehicle tire Crr's of at least 10 times higher per \"Rolling resistance coefficient examples\" in this article</ref>\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient==\nThe \"rolling resistance coefficient\" is defined by the following equation:<ref name = \"NAS286\" />\n:<math>\\ F = C_{rr} N </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown as <math>R</math> in figure 1),\n:: <math>C_{rr}</math> is the dimensionless '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' ('''CRF'''), and\n:: <math>N</math> is the [[normal force]], the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.\n\n<math>C_{rr}</math> is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.01 </math> means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 1000 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that <math>C_{rr}</math> is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, <math>C_{rr}</math> is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. <math>C_{rr}</math> is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000&nbsp;kg ),<ref>kgf/tonne is used by \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 throughout his book</ref> which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds\nof load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just <math>2000 C_{rr}</math>. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all \"specific resistances\", sometimes they are just called \"resistance\" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that <math>C_{rr}</math> is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is <math>1000 g C_{rr}</math> and is force per unit mass, where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 uses N/T notation. See pp. 78-84.</ref>\n\nThe above shows resistance proportional to <math> C_{rr}</math> but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, [[#Dependence on wheel load|loads]], [[#Dependence on applied torque|torque]], surface roughness, [[#Dependence on diameter|diameter]], tire inflation/wear, etc. because <math>C_{rr}</math> itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of <math> C_{rr}</math> that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but [[#Dependence on wheel load|it is not]].\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.\n\n#\"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.\"<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm|title=Roller Data|last=Willett|first=Kraig|website=www.biketechreview.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with [[coast-down test]]s. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.\n#The coefficient of rolling resistance ''b'', which has the dimension of [[length]], is approximately (due to the [[small-angle approximation]] of <math>\\cos(\\theta) = 1</math>) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the [[radius]] of the wheel divided by the wheel load.<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n# [[ISO 18164:2005]] is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.\n\nThe results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize \"comfort\" and \"performance\".\n\n==Physical formulae==\nThe coefficient of rolling resistance for a slow rigid wheel on a perfectly elastic surface, not adjusted for velocity, can be calculated by {{cn|date=September 2018}}\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = \\sqrt {z/d} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>z</math> is the sinkage depth\n:: <math>d</math> is the diameter of the rigid wheel \n\nEmpirical formula for <math>\\ C_{rr} </math> for cast iron mine car wheels on steel rails.<ref>Hersey, equation (2), p. 83</ref>\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.0048 (18/D)^{\\frac{1}{2}}(100/W)^{\\frac{1}{4}} </math>\n:where\n::<math>D</math> is the wheel diameter in in.\n::<math>W</math> is the load on the wheel in lbs.\n\nAs an alternative to using [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|<math>\\ C_{rr}</math>]] one can use <math>\\ b</math>, which is a different '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length.

See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]]. Equating this equation with the force per the [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|rolling resistance coefficient]], and solving for b, gives b = C<sub>rr</sub>\u00b7r.

In some laboratory tests, however, such as [http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)], smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of [[Soap Box Derby|ultimate speed]] soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for. See [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}#Pneumatic tires, effect of diameter|talk page]].</ref>\n\n==Dependence on applied torque==\n\nThe driving [[torque]] <math>T</math> to overcome rolling resistance <math>R_{r}</math> and maintain steady speed on level ground (with no air resistance) can be calculated by:\n:<math> T = \\frac{V_{s}}{\\Omega} R_r </math>\n:where\n:: <math>V_s</math> is the linear speed of the body (at the axle), and\n:: <math>\\Omega</math> its rotational speed.\nIt is noteworthy that <math>V_{s}/\\Omega</math> is usually not equal to the radius of the rolling body.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.020|lay-url=http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/rollingresistance/|title=Three-dimensional boundary element formulation of an incompressible viscoelastic layer of finite thickness applied to the rolling resistance of a rigid sphere|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=833\u2013842|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.021|title= Simple algorithms for solving steady-state frictional rolling contact problems in two and three dimensions|journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume= 50|issue= 6|pages= 843\u2013852|year= 2013|last1= Z\u00e9hil|first1= G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2= Gavin|first2= Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.09.025|title=Simplified approaches to viscoelastic rolling resistance|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=853\u2013862|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref>\n\n===All wheels===\n\"Applied torque\" may either be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]) or a braking torque applied by [[brake]]s (including [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.\n\nA small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.<ref name=Roberts-torque/> This is partly because the [[tractive force]] applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power]] = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nIn order to apply any [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p.30 including eq. (2.7) and Fig. 2.3</ref> For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.\n\nSlip (also known as [[Rail adhesion#Forces on wheels|creep]]) is normally roughly directly proportional to [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye\u2014the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nRolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).<ref name=Roberts-torque>Roberts, Fig. 17: \"Effect of torque transmission on rolling resistance\", p. 71</ref> This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.\n\n==Dependence on wheel load==\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nThe rolling resistance coefficient, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf].\n were claiming about the same value as \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432</ref> For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same \"economy of scale\" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.<ref>Hersey, Table 6., p. 267</ref> The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.<ref name=Williams />\n\nIf Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.<ref>Per this assumption, <math>F=k N^{0.5}</math> where <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force and <math>N</math> is the normal load force on the wheel due to vehicle weight, and <math>k</math> is a constant. It can be readily shown by differentiation of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>N</math> using [[Differentiation rules#The polynomial or elementary power rule|this rule]] that <math>{\\operatorname{d}N\\over N}=2{\\operatorname{d}F\\over F}</math></ref>\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nFor pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (rolling resistance coefficient) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 60-61.</ref> It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) \"schedule\", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.\n\n==Dependence on curvature of roadway==\n\n===General===\nWhen a vehicle ([[motor vehicle]] or railroad [[train]]) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not [[Banked curve#Frictionless banked curve|banked]] so as to exactly counter the [[centrifugal force]] with an equal and opposing [[centripetal force]] due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle.\nThis will result in increased rolling resistance. [[Banked curve|Banking]] is also known as [[Cant (road/rail)|\"superelevation\" or \"cant\"]] (not to be confused with [[Cant (road/rail)#Rail|rail cant]] of a [[Track (rail transport)#Rail|rail]]). For railroads, this is called [[curve resistance]] but for [[road]]s it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to [[Cornering force|cornering]].\n\n==Sound effects==\nRolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[roadway]], a process which generates [[roadway noise|sound]] as a by-product.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00159677] C. Michael Hogan, ''Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973</ref> The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.<ref>Gwidon W. Stachowiak, Andrew William Batchelor, ''Engineering Tribology'', Elsevier Publisher, 750 pages (2000) {{ISBN|0-7506-7304-4}}</ref>\n\n==Factors that contribute in tires==\nSeveral factors affect the magnitude of rolling resistance a tire generates:\n* As mentioned in the introduction: wheel radius, forward speed, surface adhesion, and relative micro-sliding.\n* Material - different fillers and polymers in tire composition can improve traction while reducing hysteresis. The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silica\u2013silane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.<ref>http://144.206.159.178/ft/200/607426/12614863.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.<ref>http://www.rubberchemtechnol.org/resource/1/rctea4/v3/i1/p19_s1?isAuthorized=no{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire<ref name = \"schwalbe\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance\n| title = Schwalbe Tires: Rolling Resistance}}</ref> For example, at the same pressure, wider [[bicycle tire]]s flex less in the sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/>  \n* Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of the sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous [[Ford Explorer]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|rollover accidents]].\n* Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a \"fuel saving\" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a \"fuel saving\" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.\n* In tires, [[Tire tread|tread]] thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> Thus, the \"fastest\" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.\n* Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]].\n* Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.\n* Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)<ref>[http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/other/Crr.html The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>U.S National Bureau of Standards p.? and Williams p.?</ref> For a rise in temperature from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.<ref>Roberts, \"Effect of temperature\", p.59</ref> It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.\n\n==Railroads: Components of rolling resistance==\nIn a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 74, Although \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 list these components, he doesn't give the sum a name.</ref>): \n# Wheel bearing torque losses. \n# Pure rolling resistance.\n# Sliding of the wheel on the rail.\n# Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth). \n# Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.\n\nWheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|Crr]].

Section 14: \"Axle journals and bearings\". Almost all of the ads in this section are for the tapered type of bearing.</ref> The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both wheel loading and speed.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig 4.2, p. 76</ref> Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60\u201380&nbsp;km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60&nbsp;km/h but at a low speed of 20&nbsp;km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120&nbsp;km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.\n\n==Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains==\nThe rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.\n\nAs an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975, Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,<ref name=rr_stat>Statistics of railroads of class I in the United States, Years 1965 to 1975: Statistical summary. Washington DC, Association of American Railroads, Economics and Finance Dept. See table for Amtrak, p.16. To get the tons per passenger divide ton-miles (including locomotives) by passenger-miles. To get tons-gross/tons-net, divide gross ton-mi (including locomotives) (in the \"operating statistics\" table by the revenue ton-miles (from the \"Freight traffic\" table)</ref> which is much heavier than an average of a little over one ton per passenger for an automobile. This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.\n\nAn example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne.

The leader, or [[sachem]], of the Pawtuckets was [[Nanepashemet]] of Lynn. In 1616, an epidemic, probably [[smallpox]], swept the region, killing thousands in its wake. Nanepashemet retired to the Mystic River, in what is now [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], but was found murdered in 1619 at his fort on the brow of Rock Hill overlooking the river.  Three sons succeeded him in his reign. One of them, [[Wonohaquaham]], also called Sagamore John, had jurisdiction over the Native Americans at Winnisemmit (later [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]) and Rumney Marsh.\n\nThe Native Americans, with their intimate knowledge of the area, often helped the settlers in their struggle to survive. During [[King Philip's War]] (also known as [[Metacomet]]'s War), the local Native Americans were forcibly removed to what is now [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where half of those imprisoned died of starvation or exposure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |title=Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered |website=IndianCountryToday.com |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105201204/https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some were enlisted to help the colonists defeat other native tribes.\n\n=== English settlement ===\nRumney Marsh was originally divided and allotted to twenty-one of Boston's most prominent citizens. By 1639, the original allotments had been consolidated into seven great farms. Farming was the principal industry of Winnisemmet, and Rumney Marsh in particular.\n\nIn 1624, [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] became the first colonist to settle in the area. He built his house at the site of the former Chelsea Naval Hospital (or Admiral's Hill).

The first [[County highway|county road]] in [[North America]] stretched across Rumney Marsh from the Winnisemmet Ferry to Olde Salem in 1641.\n\nIn 1739, Rumney Marsh, Winnisemmet and Pullen Point were set off from Boston and established as the Town of Chelsea.  The largest of the three settlements, Rumney Marsh (later to become North Chelsea) was selected as the Town Center.\n\nIn 1775, the area played a role in the [[American Revolution]] as Rumney Marsh was the site of the first naval battle.\n\nIn 1846, the town of North Chelsea was established.

In addition to the desire to keep their colony Puritan, they were also concerned with the immigration of paupers. In subsequent years a law was passed that restricted the immigration of 'lame, impotent, or infirmed persons.' Hardly any immigrants came to Massachusetts during the second half of the 17th century.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish immigration came to a near-complete stop in 1642 as a result of the English Civil War, but was replaced with immigration from other European countries.\n\nIn 1687, only 31 people lived in the settlements of Winnisimmit, Rumney Marsh, and Pullen Point. In 1739, when these settlements were separated from Boston and formed the Town of Chelsea, there were 10 homes in Winnisimmit (Chelsea), 26 in Rumney Marsh (Revere), and 4 homes in Pullen Point (Winthrop), with 267 inhabitants in total.

It has a fairly active beach front district.  From its inception, Revere Beach was \"the people's beach\", used mostly by the working class and the many immigrants who settled in the area. The Revere Beach Reservation Historic District was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998, including the full Revere Beach Reservation in 2003.\n\nThe Beach began to deteriorate in the 1950s and by the early 1970s it had become a strip of [[honky-tonk]] bars and abandoned buildings. The [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|Great Blizzard of 1978]] proved to be the final death knell for the \"old\" Revere Beach, as many of the remaining businesses, amusements, pavilions, sidewalks, and much of the [[seawall]] were destroyed.\n\nThe area once boasted an extensive array of amusement rides and attractions. The Whip, the [[Ferris wheel]], Bluebeard's Palace, the Fun House, Hurley's Dodgems, the Pit, Himalaya, Hippodrome, Sandy's, the Wild Mouse, the [[Virginia Reel roller coaster|Virginia Reel]] and many more provided hours of enjoyment for residents and visitors alike. The biggest attraction was the [[Cyclone (Revere Beach)|Cyclone]], among the largest roller coasters in the United States. Built in 1925, its cars traveled at speeds of up to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|sigfig=1}} and its height reached {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}}.<ref>[http://www.reverebeach.com/hist2.htm RevereBeach.com History page].

[[Lightning (Revere Beach)|Lightning]] was another roller coaster at Revere Beach, and was a member of [[Harry Traver]]'s infamous \"Terrifying Triplets\". In addition, there were two roller skating rinks, two bowling alleys, and numerous food stands. There were also ballrooms, including the most famous, the Oceanview and the Beachview, each the site of many dance marathons which were popular in the 1930s.\n\nThe Beach was the focus of a major revitalization effort by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] and the City in the 1980s and was officially reopened in May 1992. It now boasts high-rise housing units, a re-sanded beach, restored pavilions, and a renovated boulevard.

By 1890, the population had grown to 5,668.\n\nIn 1871, Revere was the site of [[The Great Revere Train Wreck of 1871]], the deadliest railroad incident in Massachusetts history up to that point, when the Eastern Railroad's \"Portland Express\" slammed into the back of a stopped local commuter train at Revere Station.\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] terminates in Revere, with stops at [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]], [[Revere Beach (MBTA station)|Revere Beach]], and [[Beachmont (MBTA station)|Beachmont]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] and state highways\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 1A|1A]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 16|16]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 60|60]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 107|107]], and\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 145|145]] run through Revere.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Revere Public Schools]] operates the city's public schools.

The leader, or [[sachem]], of the Pawtuckets was [[Nanepashemet]] of Lynn. In 1616, an epidemic, probably [[smallpox]], swept the region, killing thousands in its wake. Nanepashemet retired to the Mystic River, in what is now [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], but was found murdered in 1619 at his fort on the brow of Rock Hill overlooking the river.  Three sons succeeded him in his reign. One of them, [[Wonohaquaham]], also called Sagamore John, had jurisdiction over the Native Americans at Winnisemmit (later [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]) and Rumney Marsh.\n\nThe Native Americans, with their intimate knowledge of the area, often helped the settlers in their struggle to survive. During [[King Philip's War]] (also known as [[Metacomet]]'s War), the local Native Americans were forcibly removed to what is now [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where half of those imprisoned died of starvation or exposure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |title=Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered |website=IndianCountryToday.com |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105201204/https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some were enlisted to help the colonists defeat other native tribes.\n\n=== English settlement ===\nRumney Marsh was originally divided and allotted to twenty-one of Boston's most prominent citizens.

The Whip, the [[Ferris wheel]], Bluebeard's Palace, the Fun House, Hurley's Dodgems, the Pit, Himalaya, Hippodrome, Sandy's, the Wild Mouse, the [[Virginia Reel roller coaster|Virginia Reel]] and many more provided hours of enjoyment for residents and visitors alike.

The two Biblical characters named \"Lazarus\" have sometimes been conflated historically, but are generally understood to be two separate people.\n\nThe name ''Lazarus'' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life; for example, the scientific term [[Lazarus taxon]] denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction. There are also numerous literary uses of the term.\n\n==Raising of Lazarus==\n{{main article|Raising of Lazarus}}\n\n===Narrative===\n[[File:RaisingofLazarusBloch.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Raising Lazarus'', Oil on Copper Plate, 1875, [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]] (Hope Gallery, [[Salt Lake City]])]]\nThe biblical narrative of the raising of Lazarus is found in chapter 11 of the Gospel of John.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:1\u201346}}</ref> A certain Eleazer (whence ''Lazar''us) is introduced as a follower of Jesus, who lives in the town of [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] near [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:1}}</ref> He is identified as the brother of the sisters [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]] and [[Martha]]. The sisters send word to Jesus that Lazarus, \"he whom thou lovest,\" is ill.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:3}}</ref> Instead of immediately traveling to Bethany, according to the narrator, Jesus intentionally remains where he is for two more days before beginning the journey.\n\nWhen Jesus arrives in Bethany, he finds that Lazarus is dead and has already been in his tomb for four days. He meets first with Martha and Mary in turn. Martha laments that Jesus did not arrive soon enough to heal her brother and Jesus replies with the well-known statement, \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\".<ref>John 11:25, [[KJV]]</ref> Later the narrator here gives the famous simple phrase, \"[[Jesus wept]]\".<ref>John 11:35, [[KJV]]</ref>\n\nIn the presence of a crowd of Jewish mourners, Jesus comes to the tomb. Over the objections of Martha, Jesus has them roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb and says a prayer. He then calls Lazarus to come out (\"Come forth\") and Lazarus does so, still wrapped in his grave-cloths. Jesus then calls for someone to remove the grave-cloths, and let him go.\n\nThe narrative ends with the statement that many of the witnesses to this event \"believed in him.\" Others are said to report the events to the religious authorities in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Gospel of John mentions Lazarus again in chapter 12. Six days before the [[Passover]] on which Jesus is [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], Jesus returns to Bethany and Lazarus attends a supper that Martha, his sister, serves.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|12:2}}</ref>  Jesus and Lazarus together attract the attention of many Jews and the narrator states that the chief priests consider having Lazarus put to death because so many people are believing in Jesus on account of this miracle.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|12:9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThe miracle of the raising of Lazarus, the longest coherent narrative in John aside from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], is the culmination of John's \"signs\". It explains the crowds seeking Jesus on [[Palm Sunday]], and leads directly to the decision of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]] to kill Jesus.\n\nIt is notable that at John 11:11, after being told by his disciples to fear those who would kill him, and after the parable about living in darkness, Jesus references his own parable and states that Lazarus sleeps, and that He will go \"wake him up\".  The disciples thought Jesus meant Lazarus was actually sleeping in verse 12.  Then, in verse 14, Jesus speaks plainly and tells them that \"Lazarus has died\". This is to be clear that Lazarus has died in the flesh, and is not sleeping or unconscious.\n\nA resurrection story that is very similar is also found in the controversial [[Secret Gospel of Mark]], although the young man is not named there specifically. Some scholars believe that the Secret Mark version represents an earlier form of the canonical story found in John.<ref>\"Secret Mark's story is certainly much older in its form than John's account of the raising of Lazarus.\" {{Citation | last = Koester | first = Helmut | author-link =Helmut Koester | year = 2009| title = Was Morton Smith a Great Thespian and I a Complete Fool? | periodical = Biblical Archaeology Review | volume = 35:06| pages = 54\u201358, 88.}}</ref>\n\n===Depictions in art===\n{{commons|Resurrection of Lazarus}}\nThe raising of Lazarus is a popular subject in religious art.<ref>For the treatment of this subject in Western European art, see the discussion in Franco Mormando, \"Tintoretto's Recently Rediscovered ''Raising of Lazarus'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', v. 142 (2000): pp. 624\u201329.</ref> Two of the most famous paintings are those of [[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (c. 1609)]] and [[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|Sebastiano del Piombo (1516)]].

Several Christian [[church (building)|churches]] have existed at the site over the centuries. Since the 16th century, the site of the tomb has been occupied by the al-Uzair Mosque. The adjacent [[Roman Catholic]] Church of Saint Lazarus, designed by [[Antonio Barluzzi]] and built between 1952 and 1955 under the auspices of the [[Franciscan Order]], stands upon the site of several much older ones. In 1965, a [[Greek Orthodox]] church was built just west of the tomb.\n\nThe entrance to the tomb today is via a flight of uneven rock-cut steps from the street. As it was described in 1896, there were twenty-four steps from the then-modern street level, leading to a square chamber serving as a place of prayer, from which more steps led to a lower chamber believed to be the tomb of Lazarus.<ref name=\"Modern\">In ''The Biblical World'' '''8'''.5 (November 1896:40).</ref> The same description applies today.<ref>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET09mod.html Modern Bethany] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007062326/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET09mod.html |date=2013-10-07 }}, by Albert Storme, Franciscan Cyberspot.</ref><ref name=\"Sacred Destinations\">[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-bethany.htm \"Sacred Destinations\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820075541/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-bethany.htm |date=2009-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of a church at Bethany is in the late 4th century, but both the historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]<ref>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DiSegniOnomasticon.html The Onomastikon of Eusebius and the Madaba Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503165029/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DiSegniOnomasticon.html |date=2013-05-03 }}, By Leah Di Segni.

It is quite certain that the present village formed about the traditional tomb of Lazarus, which is in a cave in the village. The identification of this cave as the tomb of Lazarus is merely possible; it has no strong intrinsic or extrinsic authority. The site of the ancient village may not precisely coincide with the present one, but there is every reason to believe that it was in this general location.\"<ref>{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09097a.htm|title=Bethany}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Additional traditions about Lazarus of Bethany==\nWhile there is no further mention of Lazarus in the Bible, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life.

The scripture readings and hymns for Lazarus Saturday focus on the resurrection of Lazarus as a foreshadowing of the [[Resurrection of Christ]], and a promise of the [[General Resurrection]]. The Gospel narrative is interpreted in the hymns as illustrating the [[Christology|two natures]] of Christ: his ''humanity'' in asking, \"Where have ye laid him?\",<ref>({{Bibleverse||John|11:34}})</ref> and his ''divinity'' by commanding Lazarus to come forth from the dead.<ref>({{Bibleverse||John|11:43}})</ref> Many of the Resurrectional hymns of the normal Sunday service, which are omitted on Palm Sunday, are chanted on Lazarus Saturday. During the [[Divine Liturgy]], the Baptismal Hymn, ''\"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\"'',<ref>({{Bibleverse||Romans|6:3}})</ref> is sung in place of the [[Trisagion]].

The two Biblical characters named \"Lazarus\" have sometimes been conflated historically, but are generally understood to be two separate people.\n\nThe name ''Lazarus'' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life; for example, the scientific term [[Lazarus taxon]] denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction. There are also numerous literary uses of the term.\n\n==Raising of Lazarus==\n{{main article|Raising of Lazarus}}\n\n===Narrative===\n[[File:RaisingofLazarusBloch.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Raising Lazarus'', Oil on Copper Plate, 1875, [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]] (Hope Gallery, [[Salt Lake City]])]]\nThe biblical narrative of the raising of Lazarus is found in chapter 11 of the Gospel of John.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:1\u201346}}</ref> A certain Eleazer (whence ''Lazar''us) is introduced as a follower of Jesus, who lives in the town of [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] near [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:1}}</ref> He is identified as the brother of the sisters [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]] and [[Martha]]. The sisters send word to Jesus that Lazarus, \"he whom thou lovest,\" is ill.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|11:3}}</ref> Instead of immediately traveling to Bethany, according to the narrator, Jesus intentionally remains where he is for two more days before beginning the journey.\n\nWhen Jesus arrives in Bethany, he finds that Lazarus is dead and has already been in his tomb for four days. He meets first with Martha and Mary in turn. Martha laments that Jesus did not arrive soon enough to heal her brother and Jesus replies with the well-known statement, \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\".<ref>John 11:25, [[KJV]]</ref> Later the narrator here gives the famous simple phrase, \"[[Jesus wept]]\".<ref>John 11:35, [[KJV]]</ref>\n\nIn the presence of a crowd of Jewish mourners, Jesus comes to the tomb. Over the objections of Martha, Jesus has them roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb and says a prayer. He then calls Lazarus to come out (\"Come forth\") and Lazarus does so, still wrapped in his grave-cloths. Jesus then calls for someone to remove the grave-cloths, and let him go.\n\nThe narrative ends with the statement that many of the witnesses to this event \"believed in him.\" Others are said to report the events to the religious authorities in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Gospel of John mentions Lazarus again in chapter 12. Six days before the [[Passover]] on which Jesus is [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], Jesus returns to Bethany and Lazarus attends a supper that Martha, his sister, serves.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|12:2}}</ref>  Jesus and Lazarus together attract the attention of many Jews and the narrator states that the chief priests consider having Lazarus put to death because so many people are believing in Jesus on account of this miracle.<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|12:9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThe miracle of the raising of Lazarus, the longest coherent narrative in John aside from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], is the culmination of John's \"signs\". It explains the crowds seeking Jesus on [[Palm Sunday]], and leads directly to the decision of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]] to kill Jesus.\n\nIt is notable that at John 11:11, after being told by his disciples to fear those who would kill him, and after the parable about living in darkness, Jesus references his own parable and states that Lazarus sleeps, and that He will go \"wake him up\".  The disciples thought Jesus meant Lazarus was actually sleeping in verse 12.  Then, in verse 14, Jesus speaks plainly and tells them that \"Lazarus has died\". This is to be clear that Lazarus has died in the flesh, and is not sleeping or unconscious.\n\nA resurrection story that is very similar is also found in the controversial [[Secret Gospel of Mark]], although the young man is not named there specifically. Some scholars believe that the Secret Mark version represents an earlier form of the canonical story found in John.<ref>\"Secret Mark's story is certainly much older in its form than John's account of the raising of Lazarus.\" {{Citation | last = Koester | first = Helmut | author-link =Helmut Koester | year = 2009| title = Was Morton Smith a Great Thespian and I a Complete Fool? | periodical = Biblical Archaeology Review | volume = 35:06| pages = 54\u201358, 88.}}</ref>\n\n===Depictions in art===\n{{commons|Resurrection of Lazarus}}\nThe raising of Lazarus is a popular subject in religious art.<ref>For the treatment of this subject in Western European art, see the discussion in Franco Mormando, \"Tintoretto's Recently Rediscovered ''Raising of Lazarus'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', v. 142 (2000): pp. 624\u201329.</ref> Two of the most famous paintings are those of [[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (c. 1609)]] and [[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|Sebastiano del Piombo (1516)]].

Several Christian [[church (building)|churches]] have existed at the site over the centuries. Since the 16th century, the site of the tomb has been occupied by the al-Uzair Mosque. The adjacent [[Roman Catholic]] Church of Saint Lazarus, designed by [[Antonio Barluzzi]] and built between 1952 and 1955 under the auspices of the [[Franciscan Order]], stands upon the site of several much older ones. In 1965, a [[Greek Orthodox]] church was built just west of the tomb.\n\nThe entrance to the tomb today is via a flight of uneven rock-cut steps from the street. As it was described in 1896, there were twenty-four steps from the then-modern street level, leading to a square chamber serving as a place of prayer, from which more steps led to a lower chamber believed to be the tomb of Lazarus.<ref name=\"Modern\">In ''The Biblical World'' '''8'''.5 (November 1896:40).</ref> The same description applies today.<ref>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET09mod.html Modern Bethany] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007062326/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET09mod.html |date=2013-10-07 }}, by Albert Storme, Franciscan Cyberspot.</ref><ref name=\"Sacred Destinations\">[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-bethany.htm \"Sacred Destinations\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820075541/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-bethany.htm |date=2009-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of a church at Bethany is in the late 4th century, but both the historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]<ref>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DiSegniOnomasticon.html The Onomastikon of Eusebius and the Madaba Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503165029/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DiSegniOnomasticon.html |date=2013-05-03 }}, By Leah Di Segni.

It is quite certain that the present village formed about the traditional tomb of Lazarus, which is in a cave in the village. The identification of this cave as the tomb of Lazarus is merely possible; it has no strong intrinsic or extrinsic authority. The site of the ancient village may not precisely coincide with the present one, but there is every reason to believe that it was in this general location.\"<ref>{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09097a.htm|title=Bethany}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Additional traditions about Lazarus of Bethany==\nWhile there is no further mention of Lazarus in the Bible, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life.

In the 1960s and 1970s his guitar playing was often heard on television, radio, film soundtracks, and many recordings with the [[Mantovani]] orchestra and with Manuel and his Music of the Mountains. His recording of the \"Adagio\" from [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s ''Concierto de Aranjuez'' with Manuel sold over one million copies. His guitar quintet broadcast regularly in the late 1950s on the [[BBC]]'s ''Guitar Club'' series.\n\nMairants devoted much time to writing music and instructional method books for guitar. He worked with American guitarist [[Josh White]] on ''The Josh White Guitar Method'' ([[Boosey & Hawkes]]) in 1956. British guitarist [[John Renbourn]] and American guitarist [[Stefan Grossman]] (who was living in the UK at the time) have cited it as an influence on their playing.
