Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

He served two non-consecutive terms as  the [[List of Governors of Georgia|59th Governor of Georgia]], the first from 1909 to 1911 and the second from 1912 to 1913. He has also been posthumously implicated as one of the ringleaders in the lynching of [[Leo Frank]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born in [[Canton, Georgia]] and was the son of Georgia's Civil War Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]]. The family nickname of the younger Brown was \"Little Joe Brown\".\n\nAfter graduating from [[Oglethorpe University]] in 1872 (where he joined [[Chi Phi]] fraternity), Brown attended [[Harvard University]] for a time to study law. He continued his studies at his brother's Georgia law practice and passed the bar in 1873; however, he never practiced law due to failing eyesight. He continued his studies at an [[Atlanta, Georgia]] business college and became a clerk with the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]]. During his career at the railroad he rose to the position of traffic manager for the company, and he married Cora Annie McCord.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1904, Brown was appointed to the [[Georgia Public Service Commission|Georgia State Railroad Commission]] by then-Governor [[Joseph M. Terrell]]. That appointment was rescinded in 1907 when the new Governor, [[M. Hoke Smith|Hoke Smith]], removed Brown over disagreements about passenger fares.\n\nBrown exacted revenge by running against Smith in the 1908 gubernatorial election and winning. Smith again won the governorship in the election of 1910 by beating Brown in the Democratic primary and in the general election in which Brown ran as an independent. Smith left before the end of his second term to assume the [[United States Senate]] seat that became vacant upon the death of [[Alexander S. Clay]], and Brown ran unopposed to become Governor again for the rest of Smith's original term.\n\nBrown faced Smith once again in the 1914 election for the Senate seat previously filled by Smith. Smith won that election.\n\nBrown also authored two books, ''The Mountain Campaigns in Georgia'' (1886) and ''Astyanax'' (1907), served as director and vice president of the First National Bank of Marietta, and owned and operated Cherokee Mills in Marietta.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=Kenneth H.|last2=Cowart|first2=Jennifer Lee|title=Who Was the Real Gus Coggins?: Social Struggle and Criminal Mystery in Cherokee County, 1912-1927|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=Winter 2013|volume=97|issue=4|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=101380904&site=eds-live|accessdate=20 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince his death, Brown has been implicated as one of the ringleaders in the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915.<ref>Alphin, Elaine Marie ''An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank'' Carolrhoda Books, 2010, p. 117</ref><ref>Oney, Steve (2004), And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank, New York and Toronto: Pantheon Books, {{ISBN|978-0-679-42147-4}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBrown died in 1932 in [[Marietta, Georgia]] and is buried in the [[Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta, Georgia)|Oakland Cemetery]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2138&hl=y ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'' entry for Joseph M.

He served two non-consecutive terms as  the [[List of Governors of Georgia|59th Governor of Georgia]], the first from 1909 to 1911 and the second from 1912 to 1913. He has also been posthumously implicated as one of the ringleaders in the lynching of [[Leo Frank]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born in [[Canton, Georgia]] and was the son of Georgia's Civil War Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]]. The family nickname of the younger Brown was \"Little Joe Brown\".\n\nAfter graduating from [[Oglethorpe University]] in 1872 (where he joined [[Chi Phi]] fraternity), Brown attended [[Harvard University]] for a time to study law. He continued his studies at his brother's Georgia law practice and passed the bar in 1873; however, he never practiced law due to failing eyesight. He continued his studies at an [[Atlanta, Georgia]] business college and became a clerk with the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]]. During his career at the railroad he rose to the position of traffic manager for the company, and he married Cora Annie McCord.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1904, Brown was appointed to the [[Georgia Public Service Commission|Georgia State Railroad Commission]] by then-Governor [[Joseph M. Terrell]]. That appointment was rescinded in 1907 when the new Governor, [[M. Hoke Smith|Hoke Smith]], removed Brown over disagreements about passenger fares.\n\nBrown exacted revenge by running against Smith in the 1908 gubernatorial election and winning. Smith again won the governorship in the election of 1910 by beating Brown in the Democratic primary and in the general election in which Brown ran as an independent. Smith left before the end of his second term to assume the [[United States Senate]] seat that became vacant upon the death of [[Alexander S. Clay]], and Brown ran unopposed to become Governor again for the rest of Smith's original term.\n\nBrown faced Smith once again in the 1914 election for the Senate seat previously filled by Smith. Smith won that election.\n\nBrown also authored two books, ''The Mountain Campaigns in Georgia'' (1886) and ''Astyanax'' (1907), served as director and vice president of the First National Bank of Marietta, and owned and operated Cherokee Mills in Marietta.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=Kenneth H.|last2=Cowart|first2=Jennifer Lee|title=Who Was the Real Gus Coggins?: Social Struggle and Criminal Mystery in Cherokee County, 1912-1927|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=Winter 2013|volume=97|issue=4|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=101380904&site=eds-live|accessdate=20 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince his death, Brown has been implicated as one of the ringleaders in the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915.<ref>Alphin, Elaine Marie ''An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank'' Carolrhoda Books, 2010, p. 117</ref><ref>Oney, Steve (2004), And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank, New York and Toronto: Pantheon Books, {{ISBN|978-0-679-42147-4}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBrown died in 1932 in [[Marietta, Georgia]] and is buried in the [[Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta, Georgia)|Oakland Cemetery]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2138&hl=y ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'' entry for Joseph M.

In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

The film stars [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] and [[Dean-Charles Chapman]], with [[Mark Strong]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Richard Madden]], Claire Duburcq, [[Colin Firth]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] in supporting roles.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn 6 April 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

She is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and [[Clan McDuck]] historian who idolizes Scrooge McDuck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-ducktales-d23-expo-20170715-story.html|title='DuckTales' clip shows a whole new Webby Vanderquack|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=2017-07-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Having spent most of her life sheltered from the outside world by her grandmother (among the activities withheld from her prior to her befriending Huey, Dewey and Louie are theme park visits<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> and sledding<ref name=\"The Impossible Summit of Mt.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /><ref name=\"The Shadow War!\" /><ref name=\"Friendship Hates Magic!\" />\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar.

Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures.

She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y.

Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews. In \"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", it's revealed that his anger was rooted in a fear that the world was out to get him and that no one could understand him.

He eventually falls to his apparent death.<br />Since the movie, Merlock has made appearances in several general themed Disney media, including the video games ''[[Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' (the later in which he is voiced by [[Corey Burton]]).\n* '''Drake Von Vladstone'''{{Anchor|Drake Von Vladstone}} (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Drake Von Vladstone, alias [[Count Dracula]] Duck, is the final villain of the video game ''[[DuckTales (video game)|Ducktales]]'' and its remake ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''.
