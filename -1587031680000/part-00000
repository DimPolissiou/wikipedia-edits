See also {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, (p. 327), which distinguishes between predictions (as deterministic) and forecasts (as probabilistic). Not all scientists distinguish \"prediction\" and \"forecast\", but it is useful, and will be observed in this article.</ref> Prediction can be further distinguished from [[earthquake warning system]]s, which upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning of seconds to neighboring regions that might be affected.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}; {{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a72.3, p. 427; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}, p. 261<!-- {{Harvnb|Allen|1976}} -->.</ref>  Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred and the few claims of success are controversial.

See also [http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/earthquake/ ''Nature'' Debates].</ref>\n\n== Evaluating earthquake predictions ==\n\n{{See also|Prediction#Prediction in science}}\n\nPredictions are deemed significant if they can be shown to be successful beyond random chance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}, p. 32; {{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}, p. 302.</ref> Therefore, methods of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] are used to determine the probability that an earthquake such as is predicted would happen anyway (the [[null hypothesis]]). The predictions are then evaluated by testing whether they correlate with actual earthquakes better than the null hypothesis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}.</ref>\n\nIn many instances, however, the statistical nature of earthquake occurrence is not simply homogeneous. Clustering occurs in both space and time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|1996a}}, p. 3775.</ref> In southern California about 6% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are \"followed by an earthquake of larger magnitude within 5 days and 10 km.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1985|p=1669}}.</ref> In central Italy 9.5% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are followed by a larger event within 48 hours and 30&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Harvnb|Console|2001|p=1261}}.</ref> While such statistics are not satisfactory for purposes of prediction (giving ten to twenty false alarms for each successful prediction) they will skew the results of any analysis that assumes that earthquakes occur randomly in time, for example, as realized from a [[Poisson process]]. It has been shown that a \"naive\" method based solely on clustering can successfully predict about 5% of earthquakes; \"far better than 'chance'\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}. This was based on data from Southern California.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Alarm dilemma.png|frame|The Dilemma: To Alarm? or Not to Alarm?]]\nAs the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction, failure to give warning of a major earthquake, that does occur, or at least an adequate evaluation of the hazard, can result in legal liability, or even political purging. For example, it has been reported that members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were purged for \"having ignored scientific predictions of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake of summer 1976.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wade|1977}}.</ref> Following the L'Aquila earthquake of 2009, seven scientists and technicians in Italy were convicted of manslaughter, but not so much for failing to ''predict'' the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake#Prosecutions|2009 L'Aquila Earthquake]] (where some 300 people died) as for ''giving undue assurance'' to the populace \u2013 one victim called it \"anaesthetizing\" \u2013 that there would ''not'' be a serious earthquake, and therefore no need to take precautions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}; {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2011}}. Additional details in {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2012}}.</ref> But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost:  not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a75.2, p. 437.</ref> False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atwood|Major|1998}}.</ref> In  1999 it was reported<ref>{{Harvnb|Saegusa|1999}}.</ref> that China was introducing \"tough regulations intended to stamp out \u2018false\u2019 earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors.\" This was prompted by \"more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate.\" <ref>However, Mileti and Sorensen have argued that the extent of panic related to public disaster forecasts, and the 'cry wolf' problem with respect to repeated false alarms, have both been overestimated, and can be mitigated through appropriate communications from the authorities. {{Harvnb|Mileti|Sorensen|1990}}.</ref> The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes.  The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2003|p=48}} and through out.</ref>\n\nIn a 1997 study<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997}}.</ref> of the cost-benefit ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because \"organized evacuation of urban centers is unlikely to be successfully accomplished\", while \"panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated.\" He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=483}}.</ref>\n\n== Prediction methods ==\n\nEarthquake prediction is an immature science\u2014it has not yet led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive ''precursors'' to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical ''trend'' or pattern in seismicity that might precede a large earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=9}}.</ref> Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while 'trend' methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Nagao|Kamogawa|2009|p=205}}; {{Harvnb|Hayakawa|2015}}.</ref>\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nAn earthquake precursor is an anomalous phenomenon that might give effective warning of an impending earthquake.<ref>The IASPEI Sub-Commission for Earthquake Prediction defined a precursor as \"a quantitatively measurable change in an environmental parameter that occurs before mainshocks, and that is thought to be linked to the preparation process for this mainshock.\" {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc=\u00a73.1}}</ref> Reports of these \u2013 though generally recognized as such only after the event \u2013 number in the thousands,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997|p=429}}, \u00a73.</ref> some dating back to antiquity.<ref>E.g., [[Claudius Aelianus]], in ''De natura animalium, book 11'', commenting on the destruction of [[Helike]] in 373 BC, but writing five centuries later.</ref> There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rikitake|1979|p=294}}. {{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009}} has a more recent compilation</ref> running the gamut from [[aeronomy]] to zoology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2004|p=335}}.</ref> None have been found to be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}}. See also: {{Harvtxt|Jackson|2004|p=348}}: \"The search for precursors has a checkered history, with no convincing successes.\" {{Harvtxt|Zechar|Jordan|2008|p=723}}: \"The consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors...\". {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2009}}: \"... no convincing evidence of diagnostic precursors.\"</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990, the IASPEI solicited nominations for a Preliminary List of Significant Precursors. Forty nominations were made, of which five were selected as possible significant precursors, with two of those based on a single observation each.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Booth|1997|p=424}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a critical review of the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF) concluded in 2011 there was \"considerable room for methodological improvements in this type of research.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}.</ref> In particular, many cases of reported precursors are contradictory, lack a measure of amplitude, or are generally unsuitable for a rigorous statistical evaluation. Published results are biased towards positive results, and so the rate of false negatives (earthquake but no precursory signal) is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=361}}.</ref>\n\n==== Animal behavior ====\n\nFor centuries there have been anecdotal accounts of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, it has been suggested they are responding to the [[P-wave]].<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=1204}}.</ref> These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the [[S-wave]]s that cause most severe shaking.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref> They predict not the earthquake itself \u2014 that has already happened \u2014 but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.\n\nIt has also been suggested that unusual behavior hours or even days beforehand could be triggered by foreshock activity at magnitudes that most people do not notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=}}.</ref> Another confounding factor of accounts of unusual phenomena is skewing due to \"[[flashbulb memories]]\": otherwise unremarkable details become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Kulik|1977}}.</ref> A study that attempted to control for these kinds of factors found an increase in unusual animal behavior (possibly triggered by foreshocks) in one case, but not in four other cases of seemingly similar earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981}}.  In an earlier study similar behavior was seen before storms. {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Verosub|Howell|1979|p=687}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dilatancy\u2013diffusion ====\nIn the 1970s the dilatancy\u2013diffusion hypothesis was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> It was based on \"solid and repeatable evidence\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=217}}.</ref> from laboratory experiments that highly stressed crystalline rock experienced a change in volume, or ''dilatancy'',<ref>Subsequent ''diffusion'' of water back into the affected volume of rock is what leads to failure.  {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref> which causes changes in other characteristics, such as seismic velocity and electrical resistivity, and even large-scale uplifts of topography.  It was believed this happened in a 'preparatory phase' just prior to the earthquake, and that suitable monitoring could therefore warn of an impending quake.\n\nDetection of variations in the relative velocities of the primary and secondary seismic waves \u2013 expressed as Vp/Vs \u2013 as they passed through a certain zone was the basis for predicting the 1973 Blue Mountain Lake (NY) and 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> Although these predictions were informal and even trivial, their apparent success was seen as confirmation of both dilatancy and the existence of a preparatory process, leading to what were subsequently called \"wildly over-optimistic statements\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> that successful earthquake prediction \"appears to be on the verge of practical reality.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}, quoted by {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, many studies questioned these results,<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=333\u2013334}}; see also {{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}} and {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> and the hypothesis eventually languished. Subsequent study showed it \"failed for several reasons, largely associated with the validity of the assumptions on which it was based\", including the assumption that laboratory results can be scaled up to the real world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=226}}.</ref> Another factor was the bias of retrospective selection of criteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|pp=220\u2013221, 226}}; see also {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> Other studies have shown dilatancy to be so negligible that {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012}} concluded: \"The concept of a large-scale 'preparation zone' indicating the likely magnitude of a future event, remains as ethereal as the ether that went undetected in the [[Michelson\u2013Morley]] experiment.\"\n\n==== Changes in V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub> ====\n\n''V''<sub>p</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of a seismic \"P\" (primary or pressure) wave passing through rock, while ''V''<sub>s</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of the \"S\" (secondary or shear) wave.  Small-scale laboratory experiments have shown that the ratio of these two velocities \u2013 represented as ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> \u2013 changes when rock is near the point of fracturing.  In the 1970s it was considered a likely breakthrough when Russian seismologists reported observing such changes (later discounted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=}}.</ref>) in the region of a subsequent earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}. Additional references in {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc= \u00a72.4}}.</ref> This effect, as well as other possible precursors, has been attributed to dilatancy, where rock stressed to near its breaking point expands (dilates) slightly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref>\n\nStudy of this phenomenon near [[Blue Mountain Lake (New York)|Blue Mountain Lake]] in [[New York State]] led to a successful albeit informal prediction in 1973,<ref>{{Harvnb|Aggarwal|Sykes|Simpson|Richards|1975}}.</ref> and it was credited for predicting the 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> However, additional successes have not followed, and it has been suggested that these predictions were a flukes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=110}}.</ref> A ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> anomaly was the basis of a 1976 prediction of a M 5.5 to 6.5 earthquake near Los Angeles, which failed to occur.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1983|p=79}}; {{Harvnb|Whitcomb|1977}}.</ref> Other studies relying on quarry blasts (more precise, and repeatable) found no such variations,<ref>{{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}}.</ref> while an analysis of two earthquakes in California found that the variations reported were more likely caused by other factors, including retrospective selection of data.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997}} noted that reports of significant velocity changes have ceased since about 1980.\n\n==== Radon emissions ====\n\nMost rock contains small amounts of gases that can be isotopically distinguished from the normal atmospheric gases.  There are reports of spikes in the concentrations of such gases prior to a major earthquake; this has been attributed to release due to pre-seismic stress or fracturing of the rock.  One of these gases is [[radon]], produced by radioactive decay of the trace amounts of uranium present in most rock.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=333}}</ref>\n\nRadon is useful as a potential earthquake predictor because it is radioactive and thus easily detected,<ref>Giampaolo Giuiliani's claimed prediction of the [[#L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] earthquake was based on monitoring of radon levels.</ref> and its short [[half-life]] (3.8 days) makes radon levels sensitive to short-term fluctuations.  A 2009 review<ref>{{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009|p=382}}.</ref> found 125 reports of changes in radon emissions prior to 86 earthquakes since 1966. But as the ICEF found in its review, the earthquakes with which these changes are supposedly linked were up to a thousand kilometers away, months later, and at all magnitudes.  In some cases the anomalies were observed at a distant site, but not at closer sites.  The ICEF found \"no significant correlation\".<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=334}}. See also {{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pp=93\u201395}}.</ref> Another review concluded that in some cases changes in radon levels preceded an earthquake, but a correlation is not yet firmly established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\n==== Electromagnetic anomalies ====\nObservations of electromagnetic disturbances and their attribution to the earthquake failure process go back as far as the [[Great Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755, but practically all such observations prior to the mid-1960s are invalid because the instruments used were sensitive to physical movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|2002|p=621}}.</ref> Since then various anomalous electrical, electric-resistive, and magnetic phenomena have been attributed to precursory stress and strain changes that precede earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|1996|p=493}}.</ref> raising hopes for finding a reliable earthquake precursor.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Geller|1996a}} and {{Harvnb|Geller|1996b}} for some history of these hopes.</ref> While a handful of researchers have gained much attention with either theories of how such phenomena might be generated, claims of having observed such phenomena prior to an earthquake, no such phenomena has been shown to be an actual precursor.\n\nA 2011 review by the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF)<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=335}}.</ref> found the \"most convincing\" electromagnetic precursors to be ULF magnetic anomalies, such as the Corralitos event (discussed below) recorded before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. However, it is now believed that observation was a system malfunction. Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precursory electromagnetic signals of any type; further study showed that earthquakes with magnitudes less than 5 do not produce significant transient signals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|Dalrymple|Larsen|2007|loc=paragraphs 1 and 32}}.

A short overview of the debate can be found in an exchange of letters in the June, 1998, issue of ''Physics Today''.</ref>\n\nA primary criticism was that the method is geophysically implausible and scientifically unsound.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1996a|p=1324}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|1996b|p=1365}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=478}}.</ref> Additional objections included the demonstrable falsity of the claimed one-to-one relationship of earthquakes and SES,<ref>{{Harvnb|Drakopoulos|Stavrakakis|Latoussakis|1993|pp=223, 236}}; {{Harvnb|Drakopoulos|Stavrakakis|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Wyss|1996|p=1301}}</ref> the unlikelihood of a precursory process generating signals stronger than any observed from the actual earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|1996b|p=1365}}; {{Harvnb|Gruszow|Rossignol|Tzanis|Le Mou\u00ebl|1996|p=2027}}.</ref> and the very strong likelihood that the signals were man-made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gruszow|Rossignol|Tzanis|Le Mou\u00ebl|1996|p=2025}}. For example the VAN \"IOA\" station was next to an antenna park, and the station at Pirgos, where most of the 1980s predictions were derived, was found to lie over the buried grounding grid of a military radio transmitter. VAN has not distinguished their \"seismic electric signals\" from artificial electromagnetic noise or from radio-telecommunication and industrial sources. {{Harvnb|Chouliaras|Stavrakakis|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Le Mou\u00ebl|1998|pp=2025, 2028}}; {{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Le Mou\u00ebl|Chouliaras|1999}}.</ref> Further work in Greece has tracked SES-like \"anomalous transient electric signals\" back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Savvaidis|2002}}.</ref>\n\nThe validity of the VAN method, and therefore the predictive significance of SES, was based primarily on the empirical claim of demonstrated predictive success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=481}}.</ref> Numerous weaknesses have been uncovered in the VAN methodology,<ref>For example it has been shown that the VAN predictions are more likely to follow an earthquake than to precede one. It seems that where there have been recent shocks the VAN personnel are more likely to interpret the usual electrical variations as SES. The tendency for earthquakes to cluster then accounts for an increased chance of an earthquake in the rather broad prediction window. Other aspects of this will be discussed below.</ref> and in 2011 the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded that the prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=195}}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \"natural time\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), [[natural time analysis]] is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a [[critical phenomena|critical phenomenon]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle et al.|2012}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}.</ref>\n\n{{further|VAN method}}\n\n===== Corralitos anomaly =====\n\nProbably the most celebrated seismo-electromagnetic event ever, and one of the most frequently cited examples of a possible earthquake precursor, is the 1989 Corralitos anomaly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|pp=131\u2013133}}; {{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}.</ref> In the month prior to the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] measurements of the earth's magnetic field at ultra-low frequencies by a [[magnetometer]] in [[Corralitos, California]], just 7&nbsp;km from the epicenter of the impending earthquake, started showing anomalous increases in amplitude. Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54&nbsp;km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser-Smith|Bernardi|McGill|Ladd|1990| p=1467}} called it \"encouraging\".</ref>\n\nAdditional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed.  More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2009}}</ref> or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}</ref>\n\n===== Freund physics =====\n\nIn his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2000}}</ref> The study of such currents and interactions is known as \"Freund physics\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=133\u2013135}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Heraud|Centa|Bleier|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Enriquez|2015}}</ref>\n\nMost seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=137\u2013139}}</ref>\n\n====== Disturbance of the daily cycle of the ionosphere ======\n[[File:LAQUILA 2009 ULF.JPG|thumb|The ULF* recording of the D layer retention of the ionosphere which absorbs EM radiation during the nights before the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on 6/4/2009]]. The anomaly is indicated in red.]]\nThe [[ionosphere]] usually develops its lower [[Ionosphere#D layer|D layer]] during the day, while at night this layer disappears as the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] there turns to [[gas]]. During the night, the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]] of the ionosphere remains formed, in higher altitude than D layer. A [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|waveguide]] for low [[High frequency|HF]] radio frequencies up to 10&nbsp;MHz is formed during the night ([[skywave]] propagation) as the F layer reflects these waves back to the Earth. The skywave is lost during the day, as the D layer absorbs these waves.\n\nTectonic stresses in the Earth's crust are claimed to cause waves of electric charges<ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Takeuchi|Lau|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Sornette|2007}}</ref> that travel to the surface of the Earth and affect the ionosphere.<ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Kulahci|Cyr|Ling|2009}}</ref> [[Ultra low frequency|ULF]]* recordings<ref>The literature on geophysical phenomena and ionospheric disturbances uses the term ULF (Ultra Low Frequency) to describe the frequency band below 10 Hz.

In this article the term ULF is listed as ULF*.</ref> of the daily cycle of the ionosphere indicate that the usual cycle could be disturbed a few days before a shallow strong earthquake. When the disturbance occurs, it is observed that either the D layer is lost during the day resulting to ionosphere elevation and skywave formation or the D layer appears at night resulting to lower of the ionosphere and hence absence of skywave.<ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Athanasopoulou|Balasis|Kalimeri|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Balasis|Contoyiannis|Papadimitriou|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tsolis|Xenos|2010}}</ref>\n\nScience centers have developed a network of VLF transmitters and receivers on a global scale that detect changes in skywave. Each receiver is also daisy transmitter for distances of 1000 - 10,000 kilometers and is operating at different frequencies within the network. The general area under excitation can be determined depending on the density of the network.<ref>{{harvnb|Rozhnoi|Solovieva|Molchanov|Schwingenschuh|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Biagi|Maggipinto|Righetti|Loiacono|2011}}</ref>\n\n====== Satellite observation of the expected ground temperature declination ======\n[[File:Main india night Jan 06-21-28 01.gif|thumb|The thermal night recording on January 6, 21 and 28, 2001 in the Gujarat region of India.

In the next recording, 2 days after the earthquake, the thermal anomaly has disappeared.]]\nOne way of detecting the mobility of tectonic stresses is to detect locally elevated [[temperature]]s on the surface of the crust measured by [[satellite]]s. During the evaluation process, the background of daily variation and [[noise]] due to atmospheric disturbances and human activities are removed before visualizing the concentration of trends in the wider area of a fault.  This method has been experimentally applied since 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Filizzola|Pergola|Pietrapertosa|Tramutoli|2004}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lisi|Filizzola|Genzano|Grimaldi|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pergola|Aliano|Coviello|Filizzola|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Genzano|Aliano|Corrado|Filizzola|2009}}</ref>\n\nIn a newer approach to explain the phenomenon, [[NASA]]'s Friedmann Freund has proposed that the [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] captured by the satellites is not due to a real increase in the surface temperature of the crust. According to this version the emission is a result of the [[Quantum excitation (accelerator physics)|quantum excitation]] that occurs at the chemical re-bonding of [[Electric charge|positive charge]] carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]) which are traveling from the deepest layers to the surface of the crust at a speed of 200 meters per second. The electric charge arises as a result of increasing tectonic stresses as the time of the earthquake approaches. This emission extends superficially up to 500 x 500 square kilometers for very large events and stops almost immediately after the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Trends ===\n\nInstead of watching for anomalous phenomena that might be precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches also tend to be more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=for 'more probabilistic', for 'larger periods' and for 'earthquake forecasting' adaptation better than earthquake prediction}}\n\n==== Nowcasting ====\n\nEarthquake nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Turcotte|Donnellan|Ludwig|2016}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Giguere|Turcotte|Crutchfield|2019}}</ref> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Giguere|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Turcotte|Donnellan|Ludwig|2016}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2019}}</ref> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pasari|2019}}</ref> Typical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Khapikova|Turcotte|2020}}</ref> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2019}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Hawkins|Turcotte|2018}}</ref> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Giguere|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2018a}}</ref> etc.\n\n==== Elastic rebound ====\n\nEven the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid.  Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the [[elastic rebound]] theory of {{Harvtxt|Reid|1910}}, eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault.  Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|1910|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=329}}.</ref> The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|Coppersmith|1994|loc=Fig.  11, p. 993}}.</ref> the demonstrated existence of large [[strike-slip]] displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zoback|2006}} provides a clear explanation.  {{Harvnb|Evans|1997|loc=\u00a72.2}} also provides a description of the \"self-organized criticality\" (SOC) paradigm that is displacing the elastic rebound model.</ref>\n\n==== Characteristic earthquakes ====\n\nThe most studied earthquake faults (such as the [[Nankai megathrust]], the [[Wasatch fault]], and the [[San Andreas fault]]) appear to have distinct segments.  The ''characteristic earthquake'' model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments.<ref>{{harvnb|Castellaro|2003}}</ref> As the lengths and other properties<ref>These include the type of rock and fault geometry.</ref> of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment.  Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2|p=93}}.</ref> For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely [[return period]]) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. [[UCERF3]] is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California.<ref>{{Harvnb|UCERF|2008}}.</ref> Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.\n\nThe idea of characteristic earthquakes was the basis of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]]: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, with a standard deviation of \u00b13.1 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=619}}. Of course these were not the only earthquakes in this period. The attentive reader will recall that, in seismically active areas, earthquakes of some magnitude happen fairly constantly.  The \"Parkfield earthquakes\" are either the ones noted in the historical record, or were selected from the instrumental record on the basis of location and magnitude.  {{Harvtxt|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S399}} and {{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997|pp=211\u2013212, 213}} argue that the selection parameters can bias the statistics, and that sequences of four or six quakes, with different recurrence intervals, are also plausible.</ref> Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=621}}.</ref> The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the ''trend'', which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters.  However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S408}} say the claim of quasi-periodicity is \"baseless\".</ref>\n\nThe failure of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]] has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}.</ref> Some studies have questioned the various assumptions, including the key one that earthquakes are constrained within segments, and suggested that the \"characteristic earthquakes\" may be an artifact of selection bias and the shortness of seismological records (relative to earthquake cycles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,420}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Friedrich|Newman|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2}}, and references there; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|Geller|2012}}. See also the Nature debates.</ref> Other studies have considered whether other factors need to be considered, such as the age of the fault.<ref>Young faults are expected to have complex, irregular surfaces, which impede slippage. In time these rough spots are ground off, changing the mechanical characteristics of the fault.  {{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004|p=185}}.</ref> Whether earthquake ruptures are more generally constrained within a segment (as is often seen), or break past segment boundaries (also seen), has a direct bearing on the degree of earthquake hazard: earthquakes are larger where multiple segments break, but in relieving more strain they will happen less often.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Seismic gaps ====\n\nAt the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind.  But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the \"next big quake\" should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|2002|loc=\u00a75.3.3|p=284}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S404}}.</ref> This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific ([[Pacific Rim]]) forecasts in 1979 and 1989\u20131991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|McCann|Nishenko|Sykes|Krause|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Rong|Jackson|Kagan|2003}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect. A close examination suggests that \"there may be no information in seismic gaps about the time of occurrence or the magnitude of the next large event in the region\";<ref>{{Harvnb|Lomnitz|Nava|1983}}.</ref> statistical tests of the circum-Pacific forecasts shows that the seismic gap model \"did not forecast large earthquakes well\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rong|Jackson|Kagan|2003|p=23}}.</ref> Another study concluded that a long quiet period did not increase earthquake potential.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|loc=Summary}}.</ref>\n\n==== Seismicity patterns ====\n{{anchor|M8}} {{anchor|PI}}\n\nVarious heuristically derived algorithms have been developed for predicting earthquakes. Probably the most widely known is the M8 family of algorithms (including the RTP method) developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]].  M8 issues a \"Time of Increased Probability\" (TIP) alarm for a large earthquake of a specified magnitude upon observing certain patterns of smaller earthquakes. TIPs generally cover large areas (up to a thousand kilometers across) for up to five years.<ref>See details in {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.4}}.</ref> Such large parameters have made M8 controversial, as it is hard to determine whether any hits that happened were skillfully predicted, or only the result of chance.\n\nM8 gained considerable attention when the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes occurred within a TIP.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref>  In 1999, Keilis-Borok's group published a claim to have achieved statistically significant intermediate-term results using their M8 and MSc models, as far as world-wide large earthquakes are regarded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kossobokov|first=V.G.|last2=Romashkova|first2=L.L.|last3=Keilis-Borok|first3=V.

(2019)\u00a0 reported having successfully trained a regression [[random forest]] on acoustic time series data capable of identifying a signal emitted from fault zones that forecasts fault failure. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) suggested that the identified signal, previously assumed to be statistical noise, reflects the increasing emission of energy before its sudden release during a slip event. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) further postulated that their approach could bound fault failure times and lead to the identification of other unknown signals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rouet-Leduc|first=Bertrand|last2=Hulbert|first2=Claudia|last3=Lubbers|first3=Nicholas|last4=Barros|first4=Kipton|last5=Humphreys|first5=Colin|last6=Johnson|first6=Paul A.|date=2017-09-28|title=Machine Learning Predicts Laboratory Earthquakes|arxiv=1702.05774|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=44|issue=18|pages=9276\u20139282|doi=10.1002/2017GL074677|bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.9276R}}</ref> Due to the rarity of the most catastrophic earthquakes, acquiring representative data remains problematic.

Although [[Bath's Law|Bath\u2019s law]] and [[Omori's law|Omori\u2019s law]] describe the magnitude of earthquake aftershocks and their time-varying properties, the prediction of the \u201cspatial distribution of aftershocks\u201d remains an open research problem. Using the [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[TensorFlow]] software libraries, DeVries et al. (2018) trained a [[neural network]] that achieved higher accuracy in the prediction of spatial distributions of earthquake aftershocks than the previously established methodology of Coulomb failure stress change. Notably, DeVries et al. (2018) reported that their model made no \u201cassumptions about receiver plane orientation or geometry\u201d and heavily weighted the change in shear stress, \u201csum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor,\u201d and the von Mises yield criterion. DeVries et al. (2018) postulated that the reliance of their model on these physical quantities indicated that they might \u201ccontrol earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.\u201d For validation testing, DeVries et al. (2018) reserved 10% of positive training earthquake data samples and an equal quantity of randomly chosen negative samples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeVries|first=Phoebe M.

By 1997 it was being positively stated that earthquakes can ''not'' be predicted,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller |Jackson |Kagan|Mulargia |1997}}.</ref> which led to a notable debate in 1999 on whether prediction of individual earthquakes is a realistic scientific goal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|1999}}, \"''Nature'' debates\".</ref>\n\nEarthquake prediction may have failed only because it is \"fiendishly difficult\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}.</ref> and still beyond the current competency of science.  Despite the confident announcement four decades ago that seismology was \"on the verge\" of making reliable predictions,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref> there may yet be an underestimation of the difficulties.  As early as 1978 it was reported that earthquake rupture might be complicated by \"heterogeneous distribution of mechanical properties along the fault\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|Stewart|1978|loc=abstract}}.</ref> and in 1986 that geometrical irregularities in the fault surface \"appear to exert major controls on the starting and stopping of ruptures\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibson|1986}}.</ref> Another study attributed significant differences in fault behavior to the maturity of the fault.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}.  More mature faults presumably slip more readily because they have been ground smoother and flatter.</ref> These kinds of complexities are not reflected in current prediction methods.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984|pp=5696\u20137}} argued that the characteristics of fault rupture on a given fault \"can be considered essentially constant through several seismic cycles\".  The expectation of a regular rate of occurrence that accounts for all other factors was rather disappointed by the lateness of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield earthquake]].</ref>\n\nSeismology may even yet lack an adequate grasp of its most central concept, [[#Elastic rebound|elastic rebound theory]].  A simulation that explored assumptions regarding the distribution of slip found results \"not in agreement with the classical view of the elastic rebound theory\". (This was attributed to details of fault heterogeneity not accounted for in the theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ziv|Cochard|Schmittbuhl|2007}}.</ref>)\n\nEarthquake prediction may be intrinsically impossible.  It has been argued that the Earth is in a state of [[self-organized criticality]] \"where any small earthquake has some probability of cascading into a large event\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1616}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|1997b|p=517}}.

Clustering occurs in both space and time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|1996a}}, p. 3775.</ref> In southern California about 6% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are \"followed by an earthquake of larger magnitude within 5 days and 10 km.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1985|p=1669}}.</ref> In central Italy 9.5% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are followed by a larger event within 48 hours and 30&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Harvnb|Console|2001|p=1261}}.</ref> While such statistics are not satisfactory for purposes of prediction (giving ten to twenty false alarms for each successful prediction) they will skew the results of any analysis that assumes that earthquakes occur randomly in time, for example, as realized from a [[Poisson process]]. It has been shown that a \"naive\" method based solely on clustering can successfully predict about 5% of earthquakes; \"far better than 'chance'\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}. This was based on data from Southern California.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Alarm dilemma.png|frame|The Dilemma: To Alarm? or Not to Alarm?]]\nAs the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction, failure to give warning of a major earthquake, that does occur, or at least an adequate evaluation of the hazard, can result in legal liability, or even political purging. For example, it has been reported that members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were purged for \"having ignored scientific predictions of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake of summer 1976.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wade|1977}}.</ref> Following the L'Aquila earthquake of 2009, seven scientists and technicians in Italy were convicted of manslaughter, but not so much for failing to ''predict'' the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake#Prosecutions|2009 L'Aquila Earthquake]] (where some 300 people died) as for ''giving undue assurance'' to the populace \u2013 one victim called it \"anaesthetizing\" \u2013 that there would ''not'' be a serious earthquake, and therefore no need to take precautions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}; {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2011}}. Additional details in {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2012}}.</ref> But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost:  not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a75.2, p. 437.</ref> False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atwood|Major|1998}}.</ref> In  1999 it was reported<ref>{{Harvnb|Saegusa|1999}}.</ref> that China was introducing \"tough regulations intended to stamp out \u2018false\u2019 earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors.\" This was prompted by \"more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate.\" <ref>However, Mileti and Sorensen have argued that the extent of panic related to public disaster forecasts, and the 'cry wolf' problem with respect to repeated false alarms, have both been overestimated, and can be mitigated through appropriate communications from the authorities. {{Harvnb|Mileti|Sorensen|1990}}.</ref> The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes.  The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2003|p=48}} and through out.</ref>\n\nIn a 1997 study<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997}}.</ref> of the cost-benefit ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because \"organized evacuation of urban centers is unlikely to be successfully accomplished\", while \"panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated.\" He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=483}}.</ref>\n\n== Prediction methods ==\n\nEarthquake prediction is an immature science\u2014it has not yet led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive ''precursors'' to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical ''trend'' or pattern in seismicity that might precede a large earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=9}}.</ref> Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while 'trend' methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Nagao|Kamogawa|2009|p=205}}; {{Harvnb|Hayakawa|2015}}.</ref>\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nAn earthquake precursor is an anomalous phenomenon that might give effective warning of an impending earthquake.<ref>The IASPEI Sub-Commission for Earthquake Prediction defined a precursor as \"a quantitatively measurable change in an environmental parameter that occurs before mainshocks, and that is thought to be linked to the preparation process for this mainshock.\" {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc=\u00a73.1}}</ref> Reports of these \u2013 though generally recognized as such only after the event \u2013 number in the thousands,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997|p=429}}, \u00a73.</ref> some dating back to antiquity.<ref>E.g., [[Claudius Aelianus]], in ''De natura animalium, book 11'', commenting on the destruction of [[Helike]] in 373 BC, but writing five centuries later.</ref> There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rikitake|1979|p=294}}. {{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009}} has a more recent compilation</ref> running the gamut from [[aeronomy]] to zoology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2004|p=335}}.</ref> None have been found to be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}}.

Forty nominations were made, of which five were selected as possible significant precursors, with two of those based on a single observation each.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Booth|1997|p=424}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a critical review of the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF) concluded in 2011 there was \"considerable room for methodological improvements in this type of research.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}.</ref> In particular, many cases of reported precursors are contradictory, lack a measure of amplitude, or are generally unsuitable for a rigorous statistical evaluation. Published results are biased towards positive results, and so the rate of false negatives (earthquake but no precursory signal) is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=361}}.</ref>\n\n==== Animal behavior ====\n\nFor centuries there have been anecdotal accounts of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, it has been suggested they are responding to the [[P-wave]].<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=1204}}.</ref> These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the [[S-wave]]s that cause most severe shaking.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref> They predict not the earthquake itself \u2014 that has already happened \u2014 but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.\n\nIt has also been suggested that unusual behavior hours or even days beforehand could be triggered by foreshock activity at magnitudes that most people do not notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=}}.</ref> Another confounding factor of accounts of unusual phenomena is skewing due to \"[[flashbulb memories]]\": otherwise unremarkable details become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Kulik|1977}}.</ref> A study that attempted to control for these kinds of factors found an increase in unusual animal behavior (possibly triggered by foreshocks) in one case, but not in four other cases of seemingly similar earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981}}.  In an earlier study similar behavior was seen before storms. {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Verosub|Howell|1979|p=687}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dilatancy\u2013diffusion ====\nIn the 1970s the dilatancy\u2013diffusion hypothesis was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> It was based on \"solid and repeatable evidence\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=217}}.</ref> from laboratory experiments that highly stressed crystalline rock experienced a change in volume, or ''dilatancy'',<ref>Subsequent ''diffusion'' of water back into the affected volume of rock is what leads to failure.  {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref> which causes changes in other characteristics, such as seismic velocity and electrical resistivity, and even large-scale uplifts of topography.  It was believed this happened in a 'preparatory phase' just prior to the earthquake, and that suitable monitoring could therefore warn of an impending quake.\n\nDetection of variations in the relative velocities of the primary and secondary seismic waves \u2013 expressed as Vp/Vs \u2013 as they passed through a certain zone was the basis for predicting the 1973 Blue Mountain Lake (NY) and 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> Although these predictions were informal and even trivial, their apparent success was seen as confirmation of both dilatancy and the existence of a preparatory process, leading to what were subsequently called \"wildly over-optimistic statements\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> that successful earthquake prediction \"appears to be on the verge of practical reality.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}, quoted by {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, many studies questioned these results,<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=333\u2013334}}; see also {{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}} and {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> and the hypothesis eventually languished. Subsequent study showed it \"failed for several reasons, largely associated with the validity of the assumptions on which it was based\", including the assumption that laboratory results can be scaled up to the real world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=226}}.</ref> Another factor was the bias of retrospective selection of criteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|pp=220\u2013221, 226}}; see also {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> Other studies have shown dilatancy to be so negligible that {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012}} concluded: \"The concept of a large-scale 'preparation zone' indicating the likely magnitude of a future event, remains as ethereal as the ether that went undetected in the [[Michelson\u2013Morley]] experiment.\"\n\n==== Changes in V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub> ====\n\n''V''<sub>p</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of a seismic \"P\" (primary or pressure) wave passing through rock, while ''V''<sub>s</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of the \"S\" (secondary or shear) wave.  Small-scale laboratory experiments have shown that the ratio of these two velocities \u2013 represented as ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> \u2013 changes when rock is near the point of fracturing.  In the 1970s it was considered a likely breakthrough when Russian seismologists reported observing such changes (later discounted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=}}.</ref>) in the region of a subsequent earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}. Additional references in {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc= \u00a72.4}}.</ref> This effect, as well as other possible precursors, has been attributed to dilatancy, where rock stressed to near its breaking point expands (dilates) slightly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref>\n\nStudy of this phenomenon near [[Blue Mountain Lake (New York)|Blue Mountain Lake]] in [[New York State]] led to a successful albeit informal prediction in 1973,<ref>{{Harvnb|Aggarwal|Sykes|Simpson|Richards|1975}}.</ref> and it was credited for predicting the 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> However, additional successes have not followed, and it has been suggested that these predictions were a flukes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=110}}.</ref> A ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> anomaly was the basis of a 1976 prediction of a M 5.5 to 6.5 earthquake near Los Angeles, which failed to occur.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1983|p=79}}; {{Harvnb|Whitcomb|1977}}.</ref> Other studies relying on quarry blasts (more precise, and repeatable) found no such variations,<ref>{{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}}.</ref> while an analysis of two earthquakes in California found that the variations reported were more likely caused by other factors, including retrospective selection of data.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997}} noted that reports of significant velocity changes have ceased since about 1980.\n\n==== Radon emissions ====\n\nMost rock contains small amounts of gases that can be isotopically distinguished from the normal atmospheric gases.  There are reports of spikes in the concentrations of such gases prior to a major earthquake; this has been attributed to release due to pre-seismic stress or fracturing of the rock.  One of these gases is [[radon]], produced by radioactive decay of the trace amounts of uranium present in most rock.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=333}}</ref>\n\nRadon is useful as a potential earthquake predictor because it is radioactive and thus easily detected,<ref>Giampaolo Giuiliani's claimed prediction of the [[#L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] earthquake was based on monitoring of radon levels.</ref> and its short [[half-life]] (3.8 days) makes radon levels sensitive to short-term fluctuations.  A 2009 review<ref>{{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009|p=382}}.</ref> found 125 reports of changes in radon emissions prior to 86 earthquakes since 1966. But as the ICEF found in its review, the earthquakes with which these changes are supposedly linked were up to a thousand kilometers away, months later, and at all magnitudes.  In some cases the anomalies were observed at a distant site, but not at closer sites.  The ICEF found \"no significant correlation\".<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=334}}. See also {{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pp=93\u201395}}.</ref> Another review concluded that in some cases changes in radon levels preceded an earthquake, but a correlation is not yet firmly established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\n==== Electromagnetic anomalies ====\nObservations of electromagnetic disturbances and their attribution to the earthquake failure process go back as far as the [[Great Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755, but practically all such observations prior to the mid-1960s are invalid because the instruments used were sensitive to physical movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|2002|p=621}}.</ref> Since then various anomalous electrical, electric-resistive, and magnetic phenomena have been attributed to precursory stress and strain changes that precede earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|1996|p=493}}.</ref> raising hopes for finding a reliable earthquake precursor.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Geller|1996a}} and {{Harvnb|Geller|1996b}} for some history of these hopes.</ref> While a handful of researchers have gained much attention with either theories of how such phenomena might be generated, claims of having observed such phenomena prior to an earthquake, no such phenomena has been shown to be an actual precursor.\n\nA 2011 review by the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF)<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=335}}.</ref> found the \"most convincing\" electromagnetic precursors to be ULF magnetic anomalies, such as the Corralitos event (discussed below) recorded before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. However, it is now believed that observation was a system malfunction. Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precursory electromagnetic signals of any type; further study showed that earthquakes with magnitudes less than 5 do not produce significant transient signals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|Dalrymple|Larsen|2007|loc=paragraphs 1 and 32}}.

For example the VAN \"IOA\" station was next to an antenna park, and the station at Pirgos, where most of the 1980s predictions were derived, was found to lie over the buried grounding grid of a military radio transmitter.

It seems that where there have been recent shocks the VAN personnel are more likely to interpret the usual electrical variations as SES. The tendency for earthquakes to cluster then accounts for an increased chance of an earthquake in the rather broad prediction window. Other aspects of this will be discussed below.</ref> and in 2011 the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded that the prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=195}}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \"natural time\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), [[natural time analysis]] is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction.

Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54&nbsp;km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser-Smith|Bernardi|McGill|Ladd|1990| p=1467}} called it \"encouraging\".</ref>\n\nAdditional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed.  More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2009}}</ref> or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}</ref>\n\n===== Freund physics =====\n\nIn his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2000}}</ref> The study of such currents and interactions is known as \"Freund physics\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=133\u2013135}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Heraud|Centa|Bleier|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Enriquez|2015}}</ref>\n\nMost seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=137\u2013139}}</ref>\n\n====== Disturbance of the daily cycle of the ionosphere ======\n[[File:LAQUILA 2009 ULF.JPG|thumb|The ULF* recording of the D layer retention of the ionosphere which absorbs EM radiation during the nights before the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on 6/4/2009]]. The anomaly is indicated in red.]]\nThe [[ionosphere]] usually develops its lower [[Ionosphere#D layer|D layer]] during the day, while at night this layer disappears as the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] there turns to [[gas]]. During the night, the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]] of the ionosphere remains formed, in higher altitude than D layer. A [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|waveguide]] for low [[High frequency|HF]] radio frequencies up to 10&nbsp;MHz is formed during the night ([[skywave]] propagation) as the F layer reflects these waves back to the Earth.

During the evaluation process, the background of daily variation and [[noise]] due to atmospheric disturbances and human activities are removed before visualizing the concentration of trends in the wider area of a fault.  This method has been experimentally applied since 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Filizzola|Pergola|Pietrapertosa|Tramutoli|2004}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lisi|Filizzola|Genzano|Grimaldi|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pergola|Aliano|Coviello|Filizzola|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Genzano|Aliano|Corrado|Filizzola|2009}}</ref>\n\nIn a newer approach to explain the phenomenon, [[NASA]]'s Friedmann Freund has proposed that the [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] captured by the satellites is not due to a real increase in the surface temperature of the crust. According to this version the emission is a result of the [[Quantum excitation (accelerator physics)|quantum excitation]] that occurs at the chemical re-bonding of [[Electric charge|positive charge]] carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]) which are traveling from the deepest layers to the surface of the crust at a speed of 200 meters per second. The electric charge arises as a result of increasing tectonic stresses as the time of the earthquake approaches. This emission extends superficially up to 500 x 500 square kilometers for very large events and stops almost immediately after the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Trends ===\n\nInstead of watching for anomalous phenomena that might be precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches also tend to be more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=for 'more probabilistic', for 'larger periods' and for 'earthquake forecasting' adaptation better than earthquake prediction}}\n\n==== Nowcasting ====\n\nEarthquake nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Turcotte|Donnellan|Ludwig|2016}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Giguere|Turcotte|Crutchfield|2019}}</ref> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Giguere|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Turcotte|Donnellan|Ludwig|2016}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2019}}</ref> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pasari|2019}}</ref> Typical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Khapikova|Turcotte|2020}}</ref> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2019}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Hawkins|Turcotte|2018}}</ref> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rundle|Luginbuhl|Giguere|Turcotte|2018b}}</ref> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Luginbuhl|Rundle|Turcotte|2018a}}</ref> etc.\n\n==== Elastic rebound ====\n\nEven the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid.  Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the [[elastic rebound]] theory of {{Harvtxt|Reid|1910}}, eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault.  Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|1910|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=329}}.</ref> The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|Coppersmith|1994|loc=Fig.  11, p. 993}}.</ref> the demonstrated existence of large [[strike-slip]] displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zoback|2006}} provides a clear explanation.  {{Harvnb|Evans|1997|loc=\u00a72.2}} also provides a description of the \"self-organized criticality\" (SOC) paradigm that is displacing the elastic rebound model.</ref>\n\n==== Characteristic earthquakes ====\n\nThe most studied earthquake faults (such as the [[Nankai megathrust]], the [[Wasatch fault]], and the [[San Andreas fault]]) appear to have distinct segments.  The ''characteristic earthquake'' model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments.<ref>{{harvnb|Castellaro|2003}}</ref> As the lengths and other properties<ref>These include the type of rock and fault geometry.</ref> of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment.  Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2|p=93}}.</ref> For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely [[return period]]) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. [[UCERF3]] is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California.<ref>{{Harvnb|UCERF|2008}}.</ref> Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.\n\nThe idea of characteristic earthquakes was the basis of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]]: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, with a standard deviation of \u00b13.1 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=619}}. Of course these were not the only earthquakes in this period. The attentive reader will recall that, in seismically active areas, earthquakes of some magnitude happen fairly constantly.  The \"Parkfield earthquakes\" are either the ones noted in the historical record, or were selected from the instrumental record on the basis of location and magnitude.  {{Harvtxt|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S399}} and {{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997|pp=211\u2013212, 213}} argue that the selection parameters can bias the statistics, and that sequences of four or six quakes, with different recurrence intervals, are also plausible.</ref> Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=621}}.</ref> The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the ''trend'', which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters.  However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S408}} say the claim of quasi-periodicity is \"baseless\".</ref>\n\nThe failure of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]] has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}.</ref> Some studies have questioned the various assumptions, including the key one that earthquakes are constrained within segments, and suggested that the \"characteristic earthquakes\" may be an artifact of selection bias and the shortness of seismological records (relative to earthquake cycles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,420}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Friedrich|Newman|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2}}, and references there; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|Geller|2012}}. See also the Nature debates.</ref> Other studies have considered whether other factors need to be considered, such as the age of the fault.<ref>Young faults are expected to have complex, irregular surfaces, which impede slippage. In time these rough spots are ground off, changing the mechanical characteristics of the fault.  {{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004|p=185}}.</ref> Whether earthquake ruptures are more generally constrained within a segment (as is often seen), or break past segment boundaries (also seen), has a direct bearing on the degree of earthquake hazard: earthquakes are larger where multiple segments break, but in relieving more strain they will happen less often.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Seismic gaps ====\n\nAt the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind.  But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the \"next big quake\" should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|2002|loc=\u00a75.3.3|p=284}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S404}}.</ref> This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific ([[Pacific Rim]]) forecasts in 1979 and 1989\u20131991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|McCann|Nishenko|Sykes|Krause|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Rong|Jackson|Kagan|2003}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect.

Probably the most widely known is the M8 family of algorithms (including the RTP method) developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]].  M8 issues a \"Time of Increased Probability\" (TIP) alarm for a large earthquake of a specified magnitude upon observing certain patterns of smaller earthquakes. TIPs generally cover large areas (up to a thousand kilometers across) for up to five years.<ref>See details in {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.4}}.</ref> Such large parameters have made M8 controversial, as it is hard to determine whether any hits that happened were skillfully predicted, or only the result of chance.\n\nM8 gained considerable attention when the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes occurred within a TIP.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref>  In 1999, Keilis-Borok's group published a claim to have achieved statistically significant intermediate-term results using their M8 and MSc models, as far as world-wide large earthquakes are regarded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kossobokov|first=V.G.|last2=Romashkova|first2=L.L.|last3=Keilis-Borok|first3=V.

(2019)\u00a0 reported having successfully trained a regression [[random forest]] on acoustic time series data capable of identifying a signal emitted from fault zones that forecasts fault failure. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) suggested that the identified signal, previously assumed to be statistical noise, reflects the increasing emission of energy before its sudden release during a slip event. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) further postulated that their approach could bound fault failure times and lead to the identification of other unknown signals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rouet-Leduc|first=Bertrand|last2=Hulbert|first2=Claudia|last3=Lubbers|first3=Nicholas|last4=Barros|first4=Kipton|last5=Humphreys|first5=Colin|last6=Johnson|first6=Paul A.|date=2017-09-28|title=Machine Learning Predicts Laboratory Earthquakes|arxiv=1702.05774|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=44|issue=18|pages=9276\u20139282|doi=10.1002/2017GL074677|bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.9276R}}</ref> Due to the rarity of the most catastrophic earthquakes, acquiring representative data remains problematic. In response, Rouet-Leduc et al.

Although [[Bath's Law|Bath\u2019s law]] and [[Omori's law|Omori\u2019s law]] describe the magnitude of earthquake aftershocks and their time-varying properties, the prediction of the \u201cspatial distribution of aftershocks\u201d remains an open research problem. Using the [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[TensorFlow]] software libraries, DeVries et al. (2018) trained a [[neural network]] that achieved higher accuracy in the prediction of spatial distributions of earthquake aftershocks than the previously established methodology of Coulomb failure stress change. Notably, DeVries et al. (2018) reported that their model made no \u201cassumptions about receiver plane orientation or geometry\u201d and heavily weighted the change in shear stress, \u201csum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor,\u201d and the von Mises yield criterion. DeVries et al. (2018) postulated that the reliance of their model on these physical quantities indicated that they might \u201ccontrol earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.\u201d For validation testing, DeVries et al. (2018) reserved 10% of positive training earthquake data samples and an equal quantity of randomly chosen negative samples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeVries|first=Phoebe M.

The quake, striking at 19:36, was powerful enough to destroy or badly damage about half of the homes.

Included in {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993}} as part of Appendix B, pp. 45\u201366 [53\u201375].</ref> A transcript of his talk in San Francisco on 10 October showed he had said: \"there will probably be several earthquakes around the world, Richter 6+, and there may be a volcano or two\" \u2013 which, on a global scale, is about average for a week \u2013 with no mention of any earthquake in California.<ref>{{Harvnb|AHWG|1990|p=30 [72]}}.</ref>\n\nThough the AHWG report disproved both Browning's claims of prior success and the basis of his \"projection\", it made little impact after a year of continued claims of a successful prediction. Browning's prediction received the support of geophysicist David Stewart,<ref>Previously involved in a psychic prediction of an earthquake for North Carolina in 1975 {{Harv|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=13 [21]}}, Stewart sent a 13 page memo to a number of colleagues extolling Browning's supposed accomplishments, including predicting Loma Prieta.  {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=29 [37]}}</ref> and the tacit endorsement of many public authorities in their preparations for a major disaster, all of which was amplified by massive exposure in the news media.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993}} throughout.</ref> Nothing happened on 3 December,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tierney|1993|p=11}}.</ref> and Browning died of a heart attack seven months later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=40 [48]}} (p. 4 [12]).</ref>\n\n=== 2004 & 2005: Southern California, U.S. (Keilis-Borok) ===\n{{anchor|Southern California}}\n\nThe [[#M8|M8]] algorithm (developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]] at [[UCLA]]) gained respect by the apparently successful predictions of the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}; {{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pp=145\u2013146}}.</ref> Great interest was therefore generated by the prediction in early 2004 of a M \u2265 6.4 earthquake to occur somewhere within an area of southern California of approximately 12,000 sq. miles, on or before 5 September 2004.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref> In evaluating this prediction the [[California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council]] (CEPEC) noted that this method had not yet made enough predictions for statistical validation, and was sensitive to input assumptions. It therefore concluded that no \"special public policy actions\" were warranted, though it reminded all Californians \"of the significant seismic hazards throughout the state.\"<ref>{{harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref> The predicted earthquake did not occur.\n\nA very similar prediction was made for an earthquake on or before 14 August 2005, in approximately the same area of southern California.  The CEPEC's evaluation and recommendation were essentially the same, this time noting that the previous prediction and two others had not been fulfilled.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004b}}.</ref> This prediction also failed.\n\n=== 2009: L'Aquila, Italy (Giuliani) ===\n{{main|2009 L'Aquila earthquake}}\n\nAt 03:32 on 6 April 2009, the [[Abruzzo]] region of central Italy was rocked by a magnitude M 6.3 earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, p. 320.</ref> In the city of [[L'Aquila]] and surrounding area around 60,000 buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged, resulting in 308 deaths and 67,500 people left homeless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2010}}, p. 326.</ref> Around the same time, it was reported that Giampaolo Giuliani had predicted the earthquake, had tried to warn the public, but had been muzzled by the Italian government.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Telegraph, 6 April|2009}}. See also {{Harvnb|McIntyre|2009}}.</ref>\n\nGiampaolo Giuliani was a laboratory technician at the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]]. As a hobby he had for some years been monitoring radon using instruments he had designed and built. Prior to the L'Aquila earthquake he was unknown to the scientific community, and had not published any scientific work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}, p. 267.</ref> He had been interviewed on 24 March by an Italian-language blog, ''Donne Democratiche'', about a swarm of low-level earthquakes in the Abruzzo region that had started the previous December.  He said that this swarm was normal and would diminish by the end of March.  On 30 March, L'Aquila was struck by a magnitude 4.0 temblor, the largest to date.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}.</ref>\n\nOn 27 March Giuliani warned the mayor of L'Aquila there could be an earthquake within 24 hours, and an earthquake M~2.3 occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Guardian, 5 April|2010}}.</ref> On 29 March he made a second prediction.<ref>The {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2011|p=323}} alludes to predictions made on 17 February and 10 March.</ref> He telephoned the mayor of the town of Sulmona, about 55 kilometers southeast of L'Aquila, to expect a \"damaging\" \u2013 or even \"catastrophic\" \u2013 earthquake within 6 to 24 hours. Loudspeaker vans were used to warn the inhabitants of Sulmona to evacuate, with consequential panic. No quake ensued and Giuliano was cited for inciting public alarm and enjoined from making future public predictions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}, p. 267; {{Harvnb|Alexander|2010}}, p. 330.</ref>\n\nAfter the L'Aquila event Giuliani claimed that he had found alarming rises in radon levels just hours before.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}; {{Harvnb|The Telegraph, 6 April|2009}}.</ref> He said he had warned relatives, friends and colleagues on the evening before the earthquake hit.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Guardian, 5 April|2010}}; {{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}.</ref> He was subsequently interviewed by the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection, which found that Giuliani had not transmitted a valid prediction of the mainshock to the civil authorities before its occurrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, p. 323, and see also p. 335.</ref>\n\n== Difficulty or impossibility ==\n\nAs the preceding examples show, the record of earthquake prediction has been disappointing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}} found \"no obvious successes\".</ref> The optimism of the 1970s that routine prediction of earthquakes would be \"soon\", perhaps within ten years,<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=2}}.</ref> was coming up disappointingly short by the 1990s,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997b|p=505}} said: \"The results of efforts to develop earthquake prediction methods over the last 30 years have been disappointing: after many monographs and conferences and thousands of papers we are no closer to a working forecast than we were in the 1960s\".</ref> and many scientists began wondering why.  By 1997 it was being positively stated that earthquakes can ''not'' be predicted,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller |Jackson |Kagan|Mulargia |1997}}.</ref> which led to a notable debate in 1999 on whether prediction of individual earthquakes is a realistic scientific goal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|1999}}, \"''Nature'' debates\".</ref>\n\nEarthquake prediction may have failed only because it is \"fiendishly difficult\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}.</ref> and still beyond the current competency of science.  Despite the confident announcement four decades ago that seismology was \"on the verge\" of making reliable predictions,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref> there may yet be an underestimation of the difficulties.  As early as 1978 it was reported that earthquake rupture might be complicated by \"heterogeneous distribution of mechanical properties along the fault\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|Stewart|1978|loc=abstract}}.</ref> and in 1986 that geometrical irregularities in the fault surface \"appear to exert major controls on the starting and stopping of ruptures\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibson|1986}}.</ref> Another study attributed significant differences in fault behavior to the maturity of the fault.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}.  More mature faults presumably slip more readily because they have been ground smoother and flatter.</ref> These kinds of complexities are not reflected in current prediction methods.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984|pp=5696\u20137}} argued that the characteristics of fault rupture on a given fault \"can be considered essentially constant through several seismic cycles\".  The expectation of a regular rate of occurrence that accounts for all other factors was rather disappointed by the lateness of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield earthquake]].</ref>\n\nSeismology may even yet lack an adequate grasp of its most central concept, [[#Elastic rebound|elastic rebound theory]].  A simulation that explored assumptions regarding the distribution of slip found results \"not in agreement with the classical view of the elastic rebound theory\". (This was attributed to details of fault heterogeneity not accounted for in the theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ziv|Cochard|Schmittbuhl|2007}}.</ref>)\n\nEarthquake prediction may be intrinsically impossible.  It has been argued that the Earth is in a state of [[self-organized criticality]] \"where any small earthquake has some probability of cascading into a large event\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1616}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|1997b|p=517}}. See also {{Harvnb|Kagan|1997b|p=520}}, {{Harvnb|Vidale|1996}} and especially {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc= \u00a79.1, \"Chaos, SOC, and predictability\"}}.</ref> It has also been argued on decision-theoretic grounds that \"prediction of major earthquakes is, in any practical sense, impossible.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Matthews|1997}}.</ref>\n\nThat earthquake prediction might be intrinsically impossible has been strongly disputed<ref>E.g., {{Harvnb|Sykes|Shaw|Scholz|1999}} and {{Harvnb|Evison|1999}}.</ref> But the best disproof of impossibility \u2013 effective earthquake prediction \u2013 has yet to be demonstrated.<ref>\"Despite over a century of scientific effort, the understanding of earthquake predictability remains immature. This lack of understanding is reflected in the inability to predict large earthquakes in the deterministic short-term sense.\" {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=360}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Binary classification]]\n* [[California earthquake forecast]]\n* [[Classification rule]]\n* [[Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction|Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction, Japan]]\n* [[Earthquake engineering]]\n* [[Earthquake sensitive]]\n* [[Earthquake weather]]\n* [[Forecasting]]\n* [[National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council]]\n* [[Ring of Fire]]\n* [[Seismo-electromagnetics]]\n* [[Supermoon]]\n* [[Type I and type II errors]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}} {{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n |last= Aceves|first=Richard L.\n |last2= Park|first2=Stephen K.\n |last3= Strauss|first3=David J.\n |date= 27 May 1996\n |title= Statistical evaluation of the VAN Method using the historic earthquake catalog in Greece\n |journal= Geophysical Research Letters\n |language= en\n |volume= 23\n |issue= 11\n |pages= 1425\u20131428/\n |doi= 10.1029/96GL01478\n |issn= 1944-8007\n |bibcode=1996GeoRL..23.1425A\n}}.\n\n* {{Citation\n |ref= CITEREFAHWG1990\n |author= The Ad Hoc Working Group on the December 2\u20133, 1990, Earthquake Prediction &#91;AHWG&#93;\n |date= 18 October 1990\n |title= Evaluation of the December 2\u20133, 1990, New Madrid Seismic Zone Prediction\n}}.

However, it is impossible to induce tolerance (immune unresponsiveness) to all aspects of an auto antigen. This is because under normal physiologic conditions some regions of a self-antigen are not expressed at a sufficient level to induce tolerance. These poorly displayed areas of an antigen are called \"cryptic determinants.\" The immune system maintains a high-affinity repertoire to the cryptic self because the presentation of these determinants was insufficient to induce strong tolerance.<ref name=\"pmid2478888\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gammon G, Sercarz E | title = How some T cells escape tolerance induction | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | issue = 6246 | pages = 183\u20135 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2478888 | doi = 10.1038/342183a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.342..183G }}</ref>\n; Molecular mimicry: The concept of molecular mimicry describes a situation in which a foreign antigen can initiate an immune response in which a T or B cell component cross-recognizes self.

It is further hypothesized that individual autoimmune diseases will have unique glycan signatures.<ref name=\"pmid25578468\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | display-authors = 6 | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | issue =  | pages = 1\u201313 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}</ref>\n; Hygiene hypothesis: According to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], high levels of cleanliness expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their immune systems to become overactive and more likely to misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune or allergic conditions such as asthma.<ref name=\"pmid22090147\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rook GA | title = Hygiene hypothesis and autoimmune diseases | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201315 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22090147 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-011-8285-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe human [[immune system]] typically produces both [[T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s that are capable of being reactive with self-[[antigen]]s, but these self-reactive cells are usually either killed prior to becoming active within the immune system, placed into a state of anergy (silently removed from their role within the immune system due to over-activation), or removed from their role within the immune system by regulatory cells. When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with gangliosides of myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves' axons (i.e., [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9]]).

However, it is impossible to induce tolerance (immune unresponsiveness) to all aspects of an auto antigen. This is because under normal physiologic conditions some regions of a self-antigen are not expressed at a sufficient level to induce tolerance. These poorly displayed areas of an antigen are called \"cryptic determinants.\" The immune system maintains a high-affinity repertoire to the cryptic self because the presentation of these determinants was insufficient to induce strong tolerance.<ref name=\"pmid2478888\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gammon G, Sercarz E | title = How some T cells escape tolerance induction | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | issue = 6246 | pages = 183\u20135 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2478888 | doi = 10.1038/342183a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.342..183G }}</ref>\n; Molecular mimicry: The concept of molecular mimicry describes a situation in which a foreign antigen can initiate an immune response in which a T or B cell component cross-recognizes self.

When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with gangliosides of myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves' axons (i.e., [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9]]).

Uncertainty exists about which ''Ganoderma'' species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable.  However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dai |first1=Y.-C. |title=Ganoderma lingzhi (Polyporales, Basidiomycota): the scientific binomial for the widely cultivated medicinal fungus Lingzhi |journal=Mycological Progress |date=2017 |volume=16 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1051\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11557-017-1347-4 }}</ref>, as well as other researchers and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be ''Ganoderma lingzhi'' (Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. ''G. lucidum'' is part of a [[species complex]] that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum). Research on the genus is on-going, but a number of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years.\n<ref name=\"Zhou 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Li-Wei |last2=Cao |first2=Yun |last3=Wu |first3=Sheng-Hua |last4=Vlas\u00e1k |first4=Josef |last5=Li |first5=De-Wei |last6=Li |first6=Meng-Jie |last7=Dai |first7=Yu-Cheng |title=Global diversity of the ''Ganoderma lucidum'' complex (Ganodermataceae, Polyporales) inferred from morphology and multilocus phylogeny |journal=Phytochemistry |year=2015 |volume=114 |pages=7\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.023 |pmid=25453909}}</ref>\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\n[[Petter Adolf Karsten]] named the genus ''Ganoderma'' in 1881.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Karsten |first=PA. |title=Enumeratio Boletinearum et Polyporearum Fennicarum, systemate novo dispositarum |journal=Revue Mycologique, Toulouse |year=1881 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=16\u201319 |language=la}}</ref> English botanist [[William Curtis]] gave the fungus its first binomial name, ''Boletus lucidus'', in 1781.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Steyaert |first=R.

For example, elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels result in stem [[wiktionary:elongation|elongation]] in lingzhi.

However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color.

Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. ''G. lucidum'' is part of a [[species complex]] that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum).
