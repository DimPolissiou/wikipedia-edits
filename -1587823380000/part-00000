Carter used to put on shows in the basement and people still discover occult references in the stained glass windows. The house is in the Seacliff District of San Francisco near the Pacific Ocean. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the \"Houdini Mansion\". It is now used as a foreign consulate.\n\nFollowing Charles Carter's death from a heart attack in 1936, his son Larry Carter took over as Carter the Great.\n\nA variety of vintage posters, advertising his shows, are on display at the [[House on the Rock]] in Wisconsin.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the character 'Maxwell' from the video game 'Don't Starve' was inspired by Carter because of his connections to magic and his relation to the city of San Francisco.\n\nA highly fictionalized account of his life can be found in ''[[Carter Beats the Devil]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7868-8632-3}}) by [[Glen David Gold]].

at the [[China Agricultural University Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[freestyle wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[China

Spikey was replaced by [[Jason Manford]] from the fifth series onwards, who was in turn replaced by [[Jon Richardson]] in the eleventh series. For the nineteenth series, both captains were replaced by [[Aisling Bea]] and [[Rob Beckett]], although the previous captains remained as regulars on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'' and the show moved to [[More4]]. It then moved to [[E4 (channel)|E4]] for the following series, with Beckett remaining as captain while Bea was replaced by various guest captains. From Series 22 (2020), [[Katherine Ryan]] became a permanent team captain.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|2|18|uk=y|num=227|title=8 Out of 10 Cats}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Series

Out of 10 Cats]]'' is a [[Television of the United Kingdom|British]] comedy [[panel game|panel show]] currently airing on [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]. It was first broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on 3 June 2005. The show is hosted by [[Jimmy Carr]] and the current team captains are [[Rob Beckett]] and [[Katherine Ryan]].<ref>[https://www.channel4.com/press/news/katherine-ryan-confirmed-team-captain-e4s-8-out-10-cats]</ref>\n\nThe original lineup featured host [[Jimmy Carr]] with team captains [[Sean Lock]] and [[Dave Spikey]]. Spikey was replaced by [[Jason Manford]] from the fifth series onwards, who was in turn replaced by [[Jon Richardson]] in the eleventh series. For the nineteenth series, both captains were replaced by [[Aisling Bea]] and [[Rob Beckett]], although the previous captains remained as regulars on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'' and the show moved to [[More4]]. It then moved to [[E4 (channel)|E4]] for the following series, with Beckett remaining as captain while Bea was replaced by various guest captains. From Series 22 (2020), [[Katherine Ryan]] became a permanent team captain.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|2|18|uk=y|num=227|title=8 Out of 10 Cats}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Series

The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are

wrestling]] competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winners of two bronze medals. The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are

The show is directed by Mike Fallows and motion capture directed by Peter Salmon; it is co-produced by [[Weta Workshop]] (as Weta Productions) in [[New Zealand]] and [[Nelvana|Nelvana Limited]] in [[Canada]]. The series follows the comedic exploits of Jane, an adolescent girl training to be a [[knight]], and her friend, Dragon, a talking, flying, 300-year-old, fire-breathing [[dragon]].\n\nThe program originally aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada and on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in Australia. Since September 9, 2006, it has also been running as part of the [[Qubo]] lineup, and can be seen on [[Five (TV)|Five]] in the UK. In American broadcasts, it bears the [[E/I]] [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]]. Episodes are available as part of the \"Kids Suite\" sold via Bell/Rogers in Canada, and are broadcast Tuesdays on [[Disney Junior]] on [[Disney Channel]]. It has also been on [[Treehouse TV]].\n\n'''Jane and the Dragon''' was one of the first animated TV shows to be presented in HD.\n\n==About the series==\nJane is a red head adolescent girl who lives in the Late 8th or Early 9th century<ref name=r1>{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/jane_ask_archive.asp |archive-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616132201/http://www.qubo.com/jane_ask_archive.asp |title=Jane Ask Archive |website=qubo.com}}</ref> Kippernia Castle in a small fictional kingdom called Kippernium<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/jane_fun_facts.asp |archive-date=20 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720174513/http://www.qubo.com/jane_fun_facts.asp |title=Jane and the Dragon \u2013 Fun Facts |website=qubo.com}}</ref> located in southern England.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAccording to the backstory explained in the opening theme song, Jane was being trained to become a [[lady-in-waiting]] but had always dreamed of becoming a knight. When the prince is kidnapped by a dragon, Jane sets out to slay the beast. When Jane brings the prince back, the king makes her a [[squire|knight apprentice]]. Jane and the dragon end up becoming best friends. Further details of this early adventure are never explained in the series. They are, however, explained in detail in the book ''[[Jane and the Dragon]]'' by Martin Baynton.\n\nThe series follows Jane's interactions with the rest of the castle's residents and their frequent adventures. Themes of integrity, loyalty, friendship, and courage are woven through the stories. Jane frequently makes errors in judgment, but every episode ends happily.\n\nAs a knight apprentice, Jane trains and performs various tasks and duties around the castle. Her master is wise Sir Theodore. Sir Ivon, a valiant but somewhat comical knight, has an apprentice of his own named Gunther, a boy whose integrity seems outwardly questionable, and whom Jane views as a rival.\n\nDragon helps Jane as she trains to become a knight. When she is on patrol duty, he lets her ride on his back as he flies around the kingdom. Jane, in turn, helps Dragon, who is an orphan, in his efforts to uncover the secrets of his ancestry.\n\nIn addition to her best friend, Dragon, Jane has several other friends among the castle staff. Jester the royal [[jester]], Pepper the castle cook, and Rake the castle gardener are all about Jane's age. She is also friends with Smithy, the castle [[blacksmith]] and stable hand.\n\nAlso residing in the castle are the King and Queen, their two children, Jane's parents, and the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. The only non-resident of the castle seen is Gunther's father, a merchant who has regular dealings with Jane's father and the king. No other characters are seen or heard in the series. The wizard is [[unseen character|never seen]] but he lives in a tower, in the far corner of the Royal Gardens near the castle. He is seemingly knowledgeable in [[alchemy]]. The younger members of the castle staff appear to be afraid of him, for some reason.\n\nWhile hoping to preserve [[verisimilitude]] in its portrait of the earthy characters inhabiting a medieval castle Baynton engineered into his depiction substitute [[Profanity|swear words]] to avoid controversy with parents. When frustrated or exasperated Jane is prone to exclaiming \"Maggots!\". In this manner the series taps into the imagination of children, encouraging them to find their own expressions that can be much more fun and creative and colourful than conventional profanity without being offensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wetanz.com/last-of-the-dragon-a-jane-and-the-dragon-dvd/ |title=Last of the Dragon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204115047/https://www.wetanz.com/last-of-the-dragon-a-jane-and-the-dragon-dvd/ |archivedate=2016-02-04 }}</ref>\n\nSee the [[List of Jane and the Dragon episodes]] for further details.\n\n==Characters==\nThe characters were voice acted (in English) by the Canadian actors credited below and physically performed and motion-captured by a team of 5 actors at Weta Productions in New Zealand.\n\n* '''Jane Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Tajja Isen]], motion-captured by Angela Green) \u2013 12-year-old Jane is a young skinny girl (the TV series occurs 2 years after the novel where she was 10<ref name=\"r1\" />) and the daughter of The King's Chamberlain and the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2 |title=Meet the Cast: Jane |website=Qubo.com |access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref> She has green eyes and wavy light red<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Thing of Beauty |series=Jane and the Dragon |first=Lavinia |last=Kippernook |quote=You look nice today Jane. Your hair is very uh... red.}}</ref> hair. She found her life as a future lady-in-waiting to be boring, and wanted to become a knight and experience adventure. When she heard that the King's son Prince Cuthbert had been kidnapped by a dragon, she set out to rescue him and slay the dragon. However, upon meeting the dragon Jane befriended him instead. Her courage in rescuing the prince led the King to make Jane a knight's apprentice, and she has been training hard ever since. While it's unknown if she is aware that her maternal grandfather was a knight, she doesn't know that in fact both her grandfathers were knights. Jane is close friends with Jester, Pepper, Smithy, and Rake, and has a fierce rivalry with her fellow apprentice, Gunther, but most of her time is spent with Dragon, exploring tunnels in his cave, studying Dragon Runes, or patrolling. Jester is Jane's closest human friend, whom she often confides in about her various problems, and drags along on some of her adventures. Jester has romantic feelings for Jane<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Mismatched}}</ref> and in the episode \"Mismatched\", it is implied that Jane returns these feelings. Gunther and Jane have a strong rivalry as the castle's only two squires, though on some occasions they have been known to be civil and compassionate towards each other. Jane wields a very special sword, which she found in Dragon's cave. It is made of special metals and was forged by the fire of dragons. Its unique properties make it capable of piercing dragon skin (which most ordinary weapons can not do, since dragon skin is so thick and hard). However, since Dragon trusts Jane entirely, and since Jane has vowed to protect Dragon at all costs, he does not mind her use of the sword. The sword's hilt also doubles as a special type of removable whistle, which, when attached and twirled around on a long string, lets out a sound that Dragon can hear from great distances. It is very effective for calling Dragon to Jane's aid when she needs him.\n**'''Cleva''' \u2013 Jane's horse.<ref>Foul Weather Friends</ref>\n* '''Milton Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]], motion-captured by Aaron Alexander) \u2013 38-year-old Milton Turnkey is the royal Chamberlain as well as Jane's father. The son of a knight, his father died in battle defending the castle. He oversees all of the kingdom's finances and negotiates trade deals with the surrounding kingdoms. He is very intelligent and, despite having to deal with financial matters on a daily basis, he is far from greedy and is quite humble. He loves his family very much, almost to the point of being a bit overprotective of Jane at times (a trait he shares with Dragon) and is generally supportive of Jane's efforts at knighthood and helps both her and Dragon when the need arises. The efforts of the Merchant to try and swindle the kingdom, as well as King Caradoc's occasional spending splurges can at times prove to be great sources of stress for him.\n* '''Adeline Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Jill Frappier]]) \u2013 36-year-old Adeline Turnkey (n\u00e9e d'Ark), is the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting.<ref name=\"AdelineMTC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/cast/jane&castid=8&navid=3 |website=Qubo |title=Meet the Cast: Lady in Waiting}}</ref> She was born in the year 776 to Sir John d'Ark, the First Knight of the King.<ref name=\"AdelineMTC\" /> Her maiden name resembles that of the famous real-life female warrior, [[Joan of Arc]]. She loves her family, but her relationship with Jane can be strained at times. She has concerns over Jane's plan to become a knight and does not always approve of the influence that Dragon seems to have over her daughter. She would have preferred it if Jane had instead followed in her footsteps and wanted to become a lady-in-waiting. She also opposes some of Jane's tomboyish looks and behaviors, to the point that she forbids Jane from attending a royal ball unless she wears a dress, for fear of embarrassment (resulting in Jane and the other children holding their own dance in the courtyard, away from the adults<ref>{{cite episode |title=Shall We Dance |series=Jane and the Dragon}}</ref>). For the most part, Jane's mother seems to be content with her life and her position.\n* '''Dragon''' (voiced by [[Adrian Truss]]) \u2013 Dragon is a young member of an airborne [[herbivore]]<ref name=\"r1\" /> species of [[dinosaur]]<ref name=\"r1\" /> who [[evolution|evolved]] over millions of years<ref name=\"r1\" /> from [[carnivorous]] ground-dragons.<ref name=\"r1\" /> He is Jane's best friend and is usually there when she needs him.

It is there that he meets Jane for the very first time. His home is actually on the mountain, full of secret tunnels and traps. Dragon is an orphan, so he had to teach himself how to fly as well as other things to survive. As a baby, he was captured by humans and kept as a pet, and was traded many times before escaping. He taught himself how to speak and stayed away from all humans, whom he would call a \"short-life\". After many years, he set out on a mission to discover more about the history of dragons. Dragon saw a rune in the dragon language on his cave wall, that had been left by his father many centuries before, that indicated a child. Thinking Prince Cuthbert was that child, and that he may be able to help explain what happened to the other dragons (which had long since vanished), he swooped down and took him, hoping he could help decipher the runes. But the prince was no help at all. Meanwhile, at the castle, Jane realized this was her opportunity to finally use her secret training and she journeyed to the cave, with plans to slay Dragon. Soon, however, she realized Dragon was friendly and brought back the prince, to everyone's relief. The King, in gratitude, made Jane a squire\u2014a knight in training. After being discovered by Jane, he accompanied her and helped her with her goal of becoming a knight. He is also friends with Jane's friends Rake, Smithy, Pepper, and Jester. Dragon enjoys toilet jokes, burning things, teasing Jane and her friends, lazing about the castle, and having adventures. Despite being centuries old, Dragon has a very childlike and innocent personality and is extremely friendly. However, he can be very protective and quick to anger if he thinks his friends, especially Jane, are threatened, and he will consider any challenge to Jane's honor to mean a challenge to his own as well. Dragon is also known to be a very talented singer, possessing a splendid [[falsetto]] voice, though he does not like admitting it.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Dragon Diva}}</ref> Dragon gets his ability to fly with such relatively small wings by storing the [[methane]] gas produced from the foods he eats.<ref name=\"r1\" /> The gas is stored in two sac-like organs in his body. The lighter-than-air gas reduces his weight and allows him to fly surprisingly fast for a creature of his size. The drawback is that the very same gas also fuels his fire-breath. If Dragon were to use up his gas reserves in a fight (or a fit of sneezing) he would be unable to fly until he ate and produced more gas to replace what was used.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Pride and Pollen}}</ref> He can help increase his potential for fiery breath by consuming raw iron. Both his sight and his hearing are far better than a human's. Though Dragon has been known to fly the other children around when needed or at Jane's request, he has never let any of the kingdom's adults ride him. Dragon's scales often cause him great [[itching]], which has been referenced several times in the series. Short-life weapons cannot pierce Dragon's skin, but is sensitive enough that Jane can tickle him.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Tests and Jests}}</ref> He has a very big heart (physically and emotionally). He is also very attracted to cows and finds their general shape and behavior amusing, especially their mooing.\n* '''Jester''' (voiced by [[Mark Rendall]], motion-captured by Aaron Alexander.) \u2013 14-year-old Jester is the [[jester]] of the king's royal court.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=14&navid=4 Meet the Cast: Jester].

Because of his multitude of talents which include reading, singing, composing, dancing, juggling, cartwheeling, and entertaining with marionettes, he was appointed to the title of royal court jester. He is not paid for his services but receives free education and housing (of which, considering the time period, the education alone would be highly valuable). Jester, whose real name he keeps a secret, is generous and gifted with an excellent memory and a quick wit. There have been occasions when his quick wit has gotten him into trouble with authority, but Jester always means well and would never deliberately hurt another person's feelings. Jester is Jane's \"best human friend\", and extremely loyal; he often provides her with encouragement and was the first person to help Jane on her path to becoming a knight by smuggling her a suit of armor. He also harbors romantic feelings for her, and it is slightly suggested that she might like him in return.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mismatched |series=Jane and the Dragon}} (He got really jealous and mad when he thought that Jane and Gunther liked each other, Jane winks at the end</ref> Beneath his hat (his entire outfit is based on puzzle pieces) he has a dirty blonde hair color.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Strawberry Fool |series=Jane and the Dragon}}<br>{{cite episode |title=For Crying Out Loud |series=Jane and the Dragon}}</ref> Dragon calls him \"Floppy Hat\"{{when|date=October 2015}} and \"Jingle-Boy\"{{when|date=October 2015}}.

He is also the most mature of Jane's friends and always keeps his head in an emergency. Although he is always willing to help a friend, Smithy will seldom ask for help himself. Dragon's clumsiness goes hard for Smithy, who often has to clean up after him or find ways to salvage burnt items.  His father either ran off or died in his earlier years.

Although the same age as Jane, she is not as slim and has developed womanly curves earlier than her.<ref name=\"r1\" /> Her parents work at salting herring and they took her to the castle to find better work for her.

His gardening talents are displayed in the [[topiary]] of the Royal Garden, although he seems to spend more time growing foodstuffs than maintaining ornamental plants. He also has his own compost pile, which he maintains by himself (this helps relieve the castle of Dragon's foul-smelling waste). He plans to make his [[compost]] famous throughout the kingdom. He has rarely been outside the castle walls, or even to the higher places within the castle. The only recorded time he has left the castle is to go out with Jane and Dragon to collect herbs and plants from the forest, mostly as a gesture to give Pepper new spices and herbs for her cooking.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Go West Young Gardener}}</ref> There is an indication that he is afraid of dark stairs,<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=All Fool's Day}}</ref> but he does not show signs of [[claustrophobia]] in the castle's kitchens.

He struggles to balance his loyalty to his merchant father and his loyalty to the Knight's Code of Honour. Gunther's father Magnus believes that being a knight is simply about being a good swordsman, and has no problem with coercing Gunther into dishonorable activities. These situations reveal Gunther's greatest strength: his quick and resourceful thinking. Gunther often manages to resolve the sticky situations his father creates without damaging the merchant's reputation. Although Gunther cannot be relied upon to always make an ethical decision, he usually will act morally by the end of an episode. He can easily best Jane when it comes to strength, but lacks her nimble feet and people skills and so is far less popular with others. Gunther is secretly jealous of Jane, and the two of them are in constant competition for which of the two is the better knight in training. Working for his father often causes Gunther to fall behind with his studies. Because Jane does not have the same problem, Gunther occasionally attempts to level the playing field. For example, when Dragon inadvertently reveals Jane's fear of the dark and Gunther finds out, Jane reminds Gunther that it is against the Code to reveal a weakness of a fellow knight. Gunther then asks Sir Ivon about having the maze test at night, without explicitly mentioning Jane's fear of the dark, thus exploiting Jane's weakness without directly violating the Code.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=Knight Light}}</ref> Many fans {{who|date=September 2015}} speculate that Gunther and Jane could be romantically linked, due to the constant teasing and needing to prove themselves to each other. When members of the castle witnessed Gunther teasing Jane and assumed that they were sweethearts, however later it is shown that Jester and Jane possibly feel something for each other.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=Mismatched}}</ref> Gunther has mentioned having a \"lady friend\" fond of roses, after having earlier seen Princess Lavinia and Jane (a former lady-in-waiting) carrying some.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Shall We Dance |minutes=19 |first=Gunther |last=Breech |quote=My lady friend happens to be very fond of roses}}</ref>\n*'''Magnus Breech''' (voiced by Clive Walton, motion-captured by Aaron Alexander) \u2013 41-year-old Magnus Breech is a wealthy merchant as well as Gunther's father. He is greedy and does things such as making a fake dragon egg and having Gunther steal a dragon's tooth just to get money. He hates Dragon and is always trying to get him to leave the kingdom, one way or another. His family is not well thought of in Kippernia, as they started their fortune by trading with enemy forces when the castle was under siege two generations ago.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=16&navid=3 Meet the Cast: Magnus Breech].

He much prefers hunting, fishing, and dancing - a lifestyle that has put a considerable financial strain on the kingdom. This is shown when he spends a large amount of money on a portrait of his queen. He also loves cabbage. He is the younger brother to the real \"King Caradoc\" (died before crowning), keeping his brother's name so people remember him (his own boyhood name was \"Rathbonne\")<!--Episode: King's Knight-->. In many ways, he can be childish and is prone to bursts of innocent and childlike enthusiasm. In some ways, his children (the young prince and princess) can seem even more mature than he is. However, it is not uncommon to hear great wisdom and insight come from his lips when the need arises. He loves his family and cares about his subjects very much.\n*'''Queen Gwendolyn''' (voiced by Alex Belcourt) \u2013 28-year-old Queen Gwendolyn Hulda Ankarcrona Kippernook comes from Scandinavia. She is the daughter of a noble family and came to England on a business trip with her father, where she eventually fell in love with and married Caradoc. She is beautiful, kind, and gentle, and because of this everyone is in awe of her. Jane believes the king's support and her mother's gradual acceptance of Jane's knightly aspirations is because of the queen's urgings in private. Gwendolyn desires to build a peaceful world for her children to live in. She can, however, be somewhat shallow over her own physical appearance at times. She is very conscious of how other people view her. She feels the pressures of being expected to be beautiful and ladylike since she is the queen.

Born a sickly child, he was pampered and doted on by his parents as well as the court staff. A selfish child, he tends to take what he wants and is very hard to impress. His life hit a sour note on the birth of his sister, which meant he had to now share all the affection that was previously reserved for him. Cuthbert usually thinks about short-term goals; he is focused on avoiding work and enjoying food, but he also desires his parents to be proud of him.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=15&navid=4 Meet the Cast: Prince Cuthbert].

He has sworn to Jane's mother to never tell Jane about it, but with the way Jane pokes around, it is only a matter of time before the truth is revealed. His family comes from a long line of dragonslayers, which is revealed one day when Jane stumbles upon his family's broken ancestral sword, hidden in his clothing chest.<!--Episode: The Last of the Dragonslayers--> The sword is a dragon blade like Jane's, only the blade has the pointed half missing, with a grey carving of a dragon being pierced with a sword. When confronted with his family's past actions, Sir Theodore begs for Dragon's forgiveness for his ancestors' cruel behavior. Dragon shows that all is forgiven by melting Sir Theodore's sword into molten rubble. This leaves Jane with the only known sword capable of harming Dragon. She offered at that time to also have her sword burned, but since Jane will only use her sword to defend Dragon, he once again reiterates his trust of her with its use.\n**'''Trencher''' \u2013 Trencher is Sir Theodore's trained [[falcon]] and Jane is being trained in [[falconry]] with him.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |episode-link=Foul Weather Friends}}</ref>\n*'''Sir Ivon Mackay''' (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]], motion-captured by David Hoskins) \u2013 44-year-old Sir Ivon is loud, enthusiastic, short-tempered, and very Scottish.

The show is directed by Mike Fallows and motion capture directed by Peter Salmon; it is co-produced by [[Weta Workshop]] (as Weta Productions) in [[New Zealand]] and [[Nelvana|Nelvana Limited]] in [[Canada]]. The series follows the comedic exploits of Jane, an adolescent girl training to be a [[knight]], and her friend, Dragon, a talking, flying, 300-year-old, fire-breathing [[dragon]].\n\nThe program originally aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada and on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in Australia. Since September 9, 2006, it has also been running as part of the [[Qubo]] lineup, and can be seen on [[Five (TV)|Five]] in the UK. In American broadcasts, it bears the [[E/I]] [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]]. Episodes are available as part of the \"Kids Suite\" sold via Bell/Rogers in Canada, and are broadcast Tuesdays on [[Disney Junior]] on [[Disney Channel]]. It has also been on [[Treehouse TV]].\n\n'''Jane and the Dragon''' was one of the first animated TV shows to be presented in HD.\n\n==About the series==\nJane is a red head adolescent girl who lives in the Late 8th or Early 9th century<ref name=r1>{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/jane_ask_archive.asp |archive-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616132201/http://www.qubo.com/jane_ask_archive.asp |title=Jane Ask Archive |website=qubo.com}}</ref> Kippernia Castle in a small fictional kingdom called Kippernium<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/jane_fun_facts.asp |archive-date=20 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720174513/http://www.qubo.com/jane_fun_facts.asp |title=Jane and the Dragon \u2013 Fun Facts |website=qubo.com}}</ref> located in southern England.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAccording to the backstory explained in the opening theme song, Jane was being trained to become a [[lady-in-waiting]] but had always dreamed of becoming a knight. When the prince is kidnapped by a dragon, Jane sets out to slay the beast. When Jane brings the prince back, the king makes her a [[squire|knight apprentice]]. Jane and the dragon end up becoming best friends. Further details of this early adventure are never explained in the series. They are, however, explained in detail in the book ''[[Jane and the Dragon]]'' by Martin Baynton.\n\nThe series follows Jane's interactions with the rest of the castle's residents and their frequent adventures. Themes of integrity, loyalty, friendship, and courage are woven through the stories. Jane frequently makes errors in judgment, but every episode ends happily.\n\nAs a knight apprentice, Jane trains and performs various tasks and duties around the castle. Her master is wise Sir Theodore. Sir Ivon, a valiant but somewhat comical knight, has an apprentice of his own named Gunther, a boy whose integrity seems outwardly questionable, and whom Jane views as a rival.\n\nDragon helps Jane as she trains to become a knight. When she is on patrol duty, he lets her ride on his back as he flies around the kingdom. Jane, in turn, helps Dragon, who is an orphan, in his efforts to uncover the secrets of his ancestry.\n\nIn addition to her best friend, Dragon, Jane has several other friends among the castle staff. Jester the royal [[jester]], Pepper the castle cook, and Rake the castle gardener are all about Jane's age. She is also friends with Smithy, the castle [[blacksmith]] and stable hand.\n\nAlso residing in the castle are the King and Queen, their two children, Jane's parents, and the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. The only non-resident of the castle seen is Gunther's father, a merchant who has regular dealings with Jane's father and the king. No other characters are seen or heard in the series. The wizard is [[unseen character|never seen]] but he lives in a tower, in the far corner of the Royal Gardens near the castle. He is seemingly knowledgeable in [[alchemy]]. The younger members of the castle staff appear to be afraid of him, for some reason.\n\nWhile hoping to preserve [[verisimilitude]] in its portrait of the earthy characters inhabiting a medieval castle Baynton engineered into his depiction substitute [[Profanity|swear words]] to avoid controversy with parents. When frustrated or exasperated Jane is prone to exclaiming \"Maggots!\". In this manner the series taps into the imagination of children, encouraging them to find their own expressions that can be much more fun and creative and colourful than conventional profanity without being offensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wetanz.com/last-of-the-dragon-a-jane-and-the-dragon-dvd/ |title=Last of the Dragon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204115047/https://www.wetanz.com/last-of-the-dragon-a-jane-and-the-dragon-dvd/ |archivedate=2016-02-04 }}</ref>\n\nSee the [[List of Jane and the Dragon episodes]] for further details.\n\n==Characters==\nThe characters were voice acted (in English) by the Canadian actors credited below and physically performed and motion-captured by a team of 5 actors at Weta Productions in New Zealand.\n\n* '''Jane Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Tajja Isen]], motion-captured by Angela Green) \u2013 12-year-old Jane is a young skinny girl (the TV series occurs 2 years after the novel where she was 10<ref name=\"r1\" />) and the daughter of The King's Chamberlain and the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2 |title=Meet the Cast: Jane |website=Qubo.com |access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref> She has green eyes and wavy light red<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Thing of Beauty |series=Jane and the Dragon |first=Lavinia |last=Kippernook |quote=You look nice today Jane. Your hair is very uh... red.}}</ref> hair. She found her life as a future lady-in-waiting to be boring, and wanted to become a knight and experience adventure. When she heard that the King's son Prince Cuthbert had been kidnapped by a dragon, she set out to rescue him and slay the dragon. However, upon meeting the dragon Jane befriended him instead. Her courage in rescuing the prince led the King to make Jane a knight's apprentice, and she has been training hard ever since. While it's unknown if she is aware that her maternal grandfather was a knight, she doesn't know that in fact both her grandfathers were knights. Jane is close friends with Jester, Pepper, Smithy, and Rake, and has a fierce rivalry with her fellow apprentice, Gunther, but most of her time is spent with Dragon, exploring tunnels in his cave, studying Dragon Runes, or patrolling. Jester is Jane's closest human friend, whom she often confides in about her various problems, and drags along on some of her adventures. Jester has romantic feelings for Jane<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Mismatched}}</ref> and in the episode \"Mismatched\", it is implied that Jane returns these feelings. Gunther and Jane have a strong rivalry as the castle's only two squires, though on some occasions they have been known to be civil and compassionate towards each other. Jane wields a very special sword, which she found in Dragon's cave. It is made of special metals and was forged by the fire of dragons. Its unique properties make it capable of piercing dragon skin (which most ordinary weapons can not do, since dragon skin is so thick and hard). However, since Dragon trusts Jane entirely, and since Jane has vowed to protect Dragon at all costs, he does not mind her use of the sword. The sword's hilt also doubles as a special type of removable whistle, which, when attached and twirled around on a long string, lets out a sound that Dragon can hear from great distances. It is very effective for calling Dragon to Jane's aid when she needs him.\n**'''Cleva''' \u2013 Jane's horse.<ref>Foul Weather Friends</ref>\n* '''Milton Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]], motion-captured by Aaron Alexander) \u2013 38-year-old Milton Turnkey is the royal Chamberlain as well as Jane's father. The son of a knight, his father died in battle defending the castle. He oversees all of the kingdom's finances and negotiates trade deals with the surrounding kingdoms. He is very intelligent and, despite having to deal with financial matters on a daily basis, he is far from greedy and is quite humble. He loves his family very much, almost to the point of being a bit overprotective of Jane at times (a trait he shares with Dragon) and is generally supportive of Jane's efforts at knighthood and helps both her and Dragon when the need arises. The efforts of the Merchant to try and swindle the kingdom, as well as King Caradoc's occasional spending splurges can at times prove to be great sources of stress for him.\n* '''Adeline Turnkey''' (voiced by [[Jill Frappier]]) \u2013 36-year-old Adeline Turnkey (n\u00e9e d'Ark), is the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting.<ref name=\"AdelineMTC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qubo.com/cast/jane&castid=8&navid=3 |website=Qubo |title=Meet the Cast: Lady in Waiting}}</ref> She was born in the year 776 to Sir John d'Ark, the First Knight of the King.<ref name=\"AdelineMTC\" /> Her maiden name resembles that of the famous real-life female warrior, [[Joan of Arc]]. She loves her family, but her relationship with Jane can be strained at times. She has concerns over Jane's plan to become a knight and does not always approve of the influence that Dragon seems to have over her daughter. She would have preferred it if Jane had instead followed in her footsteps and wanted to become a lady-in-waiting. She also opposes some of Jane's tomboyish looks and behaviors, to the point that she forbids Jane from attending a royal ball unless she wears a dress, for fear of embarrassment (resulting in Jane and the other children holding their own dance in the courtyard, away from the adults<ref>{{cite episode |title=Shall We Dance |series=Jane and the Dragon}}</ref>). For the most part, Jane's mother seems to be content with her life and her position.\n* '''Dragon''' (voiced by [[Adrian Truss]]) \u2013 Dragon is a young member of an airborne [[herbivore]]<ref name=\"r1\" /> species of [[dinosaur]]<ref name=\"r1\" /> who [[evolution|evolved]] over millions of years<ref name=\"r1\" /> from [[carnivorous]] ground-dragons.<ref name=\"r1\" /> He is Jane's best friend and is usually there when she needs him.

It is there that he meets Jane for the very first time. His home is actually on the mountain, full of secret tunnels and traps. Dragon is an orphan, so he had to teach himself how to fly as well as other things to survive. As a baby, he was captured by humans and kept as a pet, and was traded many times before escaping. He taught himself how to speak and stayed away from all humans, whom he would call a \"short-life\". After many years, he set out on a mission to discover more about the history of dragons. Dragon saw a rune in the dragon language on his cave wall, that had been left by his father many centuries before, that indicated a child. Thinking Prince Cuthbert was that child, and that he may be able to help explain what happened to the other dragons (which had long since vanished), he swooped down and took him, hoping he could help decipher the runes. But the prince was no help at all. Meanwhile, at the castle, Jane realized this was her opportunity to finally use her secret training and she journeyed to the cave, with plans to slay Dragon. Soon, however, she realized Dragon was friendly and brought back the prince, to everyone's relief. The King, in gratitude, made Jane a squire\u2014a knight in training. After being discovered by Jane, he accompanied her and helped her with her goal of becoming a knight. He is also friends with Jane's friends Rake, Smithy, Pepper, and Jester. Dragon enjoys toilet jokes, burning things, teasing Jane and her friends, lazing about the castle, and having adventures. Despite being centuries old, Dragon has a very childlike and innocent personality and is extremely friendly. However, he can be very protective and quick to anger if he thinks his friends, especially Jane, are threatened, and he will consider any challenge to Jane's honor to mean a challenge to his own as well. Dragon is also known to be a very talented singer, possessing a splendid [[falsetto]] voice, though he does not like admitting it.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Dragon Diva}}</ref> Dragon gets his ability to fly with such relatively small wings by storing the [[methane]] gas produced from the foods he eats.<ref name=\"r1\" /> The gas is stored in two sac-like organs in his body. The lighter-than-air gas reduces his weight and allows him to fly surprisingly fast for a creature of his size. The drawback is that the very same gas also fuels his fire-breath. If Dragon were to use up his gas reserves in a fight (or a fit of sneezing) he would be unable to fly until he ate and produced more gas to replace what was used.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Pride and Pollen}}</ref> He can help increase his potential for fiery breath by consuming raw iron. Both his sight and his hearing are far better than a human's. Though Dragon has been known to fly the other children around when needed or at Jane's request, he has never let any of the kingdom's adults ride him. Dragon's scales often cause him great [[itching]], which has been referenced several times in the series. Short-life weapons cannot pierce Dragon's skin, but is sensitive enough that Jane can tickle him.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Tests and Jests}}</ref> He has a very big heart (physically and emotionally). He is also very attracted to cows and finds their general shape and behavior amusing, especially their mooing.\n* '''Jester''' (voiced by [[Mark Rendall]], motion-captured by Aaron Alexander.) \u2013 14-year-old Jester is the [[jester]] of the king's royal court.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=14&navid=4 Meet the Cast: Jester]. Qubo.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-28.</ref> He was left at the castle at the age of 7 by his parents who thought it was best for him. Because of his multitude of talents which include reading, singing, composing, dancing, juggling, cartwheeling, and entertaining with marionettes, he was appointed to the title of royal court jester. He is not paid for his services but receives free education and housing (of which, considering the time period, the education alone would be highly valuable). Jester, whose real name he keeps a secret, is generous and gifted with an excellent memory and a quick wit. There have been occasions when his quick wit has gotten him into trouble with authority, but Jester always means well and would never deliberately hurt another person's feelings. Jester is Jane's \"best human friend\", and extremely loyal; he often provides her with encouragement and was the first person to help Jane on her path to becoming a knight by smuggling her a suit of armor. He also harbors romantic feelings for her, and it is slightly suggested that she might like him in return.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mismatched |series=Jane and the Dragon}} (He got really jealous and mad when he thought that Jane and Gunther liked each other, Jane winks at the end</ref> Beneath his hat (his entire outfit is based on puzzle pieces) he has a dirty blonde hair color.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Strawberry Fool |series=Jane and the Dragon}}<br>{{cite episode |title=For Crying Out Loud |series=Jane and the Dragon}}</ref> Dragon calls him \"Floppy Hat\"{{when|date=October 2015}} and \"Jingle-Boy\"{{when|date=October 2015}}.

He also has a way with animals, a calm confidence that all creatures seem to respond to\u2014all except Dragon.Smithy is calm, caring, and quiet. He is also the most mature of Jane's friends and always keeps his head in an emergency. Although he is always willing to help a friend, Smithy will seldom ask for help himself. Dragon's clumsiness goes hard for Smithy, who often has to clean up after him or find ways to salvage burnt items.  His father either ran off or died in his earlier years. This is mentioned in the episode when Dragon and Jane are stuck in a cave-in.<!--if so, it has been cut out-->\n**'''Pig''' \u2013 Smithy has a pet female<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=A Pig of a Problem |first=Jethro |last=\"Smithy\" |minutes=4 |quote=Pig would never hurt a fly.

Although the same age as Jane, she is not as slim and has developed womanly curves earlier than her.<ref name=\"r1\" /> Her parents work at salting herring and they took her to the castle to find better work for her. As a cook, she works long hours in the royal kitchens and is rarely able to go outside, which is why she has a pale complexion.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=11&navid=1 Meet the Cast: Pepper].

His gardening talents are displayed in the [[topiary]] of the Royal Garden, although he seems to spend more time growing foodstuffs than maintaining ornamental plants. He also has his own compost pile, which he maintains by himself (this helps relieve the castle of Dragon's foul-smelling waste). He plans to make his [[compost]] famous throughout the kingdom. He has rarely been outside the castle walls, or even to the higher places within the castle. The only recorded time he has left the castle is to go out with Jane and Dragon to collect herbs and plants from the forest, mostly as a gesture to give Pepper new spices and herbs for her cooking.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Go West Young Gardener}}</ref> There is an indication that he is afraid of dark stairs,<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=All Fool's Day}}</ref> but he does not show signs of [[claustrophobia]] in the castle's kitchens.

He struggles to balance his loyalty to his merchant father and his loyalty to the Knight's Code of Honour. Gunther's father Magnus believes that being a knight is simply about being a good swordsman, and has no problem with coercing Gunther into dishonorable activities. These situations reveal Gunther's greatest strength: his quick and resourceful thinking. Gunther often manages to resolve the sticky situations his father creates without damaging the merchant's reputation. Although Gunther cannot be relied upon to always make an ethical decision, he usually will act morally by the end of an episode. He can easily best Jane when it comes to strength, but lacks her nimble feet and people skills and so is far less popular with others. Gunther is secretly jealous of Jane, and the two of them are in constant competition for which of the two is the better knight in training. Working for his father often causes Gunther to fall behind with his studies. Because Jane does not have the same problem, Gunther occasionally attempts to level the playing field. For example, when Dragon inadvertently reveals Jane's fear of the dark and Gunther finds out, Jane reminds Gunther that it is against the Code to reveal a weakness of a fellow knight. Gunther then asks Sir Ivon about having the maze test at night, without explicitly mentioning Jane's fear of the dark, thus exploiting Jane's weakness without directly violating the Code.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=Knight Light}}</ref> Many fans {{who|date=September 2015}} speculate that Gunther and Jane could be romantically linked, due to the constant teasing and needing to prove themselves to each other. When members of the castle witnessed Gunther teasing Jane and assumed that they were sweethearts, however later it is shown that Jester and Jane possibly feel something for each other.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Jane and the Dragon|title=Mismatched}}</ref> Gunther has mentioned having a \"lady friend\" fond of roses, after having earlier seen Princess Lavinia and Jane (a former lady-in-waiting) carrying some.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |title=Shall We Dance |minutes=19 |first=Gunther |last=Breech |quote=My lady friend happens to be very fond of roses}}</ref>\n*'''Magnus Breech''' (voiced by Clive Walton, motion-captured by Aaron Alexander) \u2013 41-year-old Magnus Breech is a wealthy merchant as well as Gunther's father. He is greedy and does things such as making a fake dragon egg and having Gunther steal a dragon's tooth just to get money. He hates Dragon and is always trying to get him to leave the kingdom, one way or another. His family is not well thought of in Kippernia, as they started their fortune by trading with enemy forces when the castle was under siege two generations ago.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=16&navid=3 Meet the Cast: Magnus Breech].

He much prefers hunting, fishing, and dancing - a lifestyle that has put a considerable financial strain on the kingdom. This is shown when he spends a large amount of money on a portrait of his queen. He also loves cabbage. He is the younger brother to the real \"King Caradoc\" (died before crowning), keeping his brother's name so people remember him (his own boyhood name was \"Rathbonne\")<!--Episode: King's Knight-->. In many ways, he can be childish and is prone to bursts of innocent and childlike enthusiasm. In some ways, his children (the young prince and princess) can seem even more mature than he is. However, it is not uncommon to hear great wisdom and insight come from his lips when the need arises. He loves his family and cares about his subjects very much.\n*'''Queen Gwendolyn''' (voiced by Alex Belcourt) \u2013 28-year-old Queen Gwendolyn Hulda Ankarcrona Kippernook comes from Scandinavia. She is the daughter of a noble family and came to England on a business trip with her father, where she eventually fell in love with and married Caradoc. She is beautiful, kind, and gentle, and because of this everyone is in awe of her. Jane believes the king's support and her mother's gradual acceptance of Jane's knightly aspirations is because of the queen's urgings in private. Gwendolyn desires to build a peaceful world for her children to live in. She can, however, be somewhat shallow over her own physical appearance at times. She is very conscious of how other people view her. She feels the pressures of being expected to be beautiful and ladylike since she is the queen. Her favorite food is peas.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=9&navid=3 Meet the Cast: Queen Gwendolyn]. Qubo.com.

Born a sickly child, he was pampered and doted on by his parents as well as the court staff. A selfish child, he tends to take what he wants and is very hard to impress. His life hit a sour note on the birth of his sister, which meant he had to now share all the affection that was previously reserved for him. Cuthbert usually thinks about short-term goals; he is focused on avoiding work and enjoying food, but he also desires his parents to be proud of him.<ref>[http://www.qubo.com/index.php?path=cast&id=2&castid=15&navid=4 Meet the Cast: Prince Cuthbert].

He has sworn to Jane's mother to never tell Jane about it, but with the way Jane pokes around, it is only a matter of time before the truth is revealed. His family comes from a long line of dragonslayers, which is revealed one day when Jane stumbles upon his family's broken ancestral sword, hidden in his clothing chest.<!--Episode: The Last of the Dragonslayers--> The sword is a dragon blade like Jane's, only the blade has the pointed half missing, with a grey carving of a dragon being pierced with a sword. When confronted with his family's past actions, Sir Theodore begs for Dragon's forgiveness for his ancestors' cruel behavior. Dragon shows that all is forgiven by melting Sir Theodore's sword into molten rubble. This leaves Jane with the only known sword capable of harming Dragon. She offered at that time to also have her sword burned, but since Jane will only use her sword to defend Dragon, he once again reiterates his trust of her with its use.\n**'''Trencher''' \u2013 Trencher is Sir Theodore's trained [[falcon]] and Jane is being trained in [[falconry]] with him.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Jane and the Dragon |episode=Foul Weather Friends}}</ref>\n*'''Sir Ivon Mackay''' (voiced by [[Ben Campbell (voice actor)|Ben Campbell]], motion-captured by David Hoskins) \u2013 44-year-old Sir Ivon is loud, enthusiastic, short-tempered, and very Scottish.
