This is an expansion of the earlier [[Jami Sahih]] collection, which retains canonical status in its own right.\n*The [[Ismaili]] shia sects use the [[Daim al-Islam]] as hadith collections. \n*The [[Ahmadiyya]] sect generally rely on the Sunni canons.\n*Some minor groups, collectively known as [[Quranists]], reject the authority of the hadith collections altogether.<ref name=\"Aisha Y.

Sunni scholars put trust in narrators such as [[Aisha]], whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\n\n====Extent and nature in the Sunni tradition====\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand,{{#tag:ref|See the references and discussion by Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah ''Thalathatu rasa'il fi ulum al-hadith; risalat abi dawud ila ahl makkata fi wasf sunanihi'', pg 36, footnote.

If,  say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations.

They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are [[The Four Books]], which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174\">Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.174.</ref> The Four Books are: ''Kitab al-Kafi'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''Al-Tahdhib'' and ''Al-Istibsar'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\n\nUnlike Sunnis, the majority of Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, every individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity. However, the Akhbari school does take all hadith from the four books as authentic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammad A.

This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our [[Shariah]] and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head.

Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/>\n\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording hadith, it has been documented that [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the great grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light.

''Ideals and Realities of Islam'', 1966, p.80</ref>\n \nHadith studies use a number of methods of evaluation developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by \n*the individual narrators involved in its transmission, \n*the scale of the report's transmission, \n*analyzing the text of the report, and \n*the routes through which the report was transmitted.\n\nOn the basis of these criteria, various classifications were devised for hadith. The earliest comprehensive work in hadith studies was [[Ramahurmuzi|Abu Muhammad al-Ramahurmuzi's]] ''al-Muhaddith al-Fasil'', while another significant work was [[Hakim al-Nishaburi|al-Hakim al-Naysaburi]]'s ''Ma\u2018rifat \u2018ulum al-hadith''. Ibn al-Salah's [[Introduction to the Science of Hadith|''\u02bbUlum al-hadith'']] is considered the standard classical reference on hadith studies.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/> Some schools of Hadith methodology apply as many as sixteen separate tests.<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n\n===Biographical evaluation===\n{{Main|Biographical evaluation}}\nBiographical analysis (''[[Biographical evaluation|\u2018ilm al-rij\u0101l]]'', lit. \"science of people\", also \"science of ''Asma Al-Rijal' or ''\u2018ilm al-jar\u1e25 wa al-ta\u02bbd\u012bl'' (\"science of discrediting and accrediting\"), in which details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (''thiq\u0101t'') of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain.<ref>Berg (2000) p. 8</ref><ref name=\"Shafi\">{{cite web |last1=Shafi |first1=Mohammad |title=The HADITH - How it was Collected and Compiled |url=http://www.daralislam.org/portals/0/Publications/TheHADITHHowitwasCollectedandCompiled.pdf |website=Dar al-Islam |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> Examples of biographical dictionaries include: [[Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi]]'s ''[[Al-Kamal fi Asma' al-Rijal]]'', Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's ''Tahdh\u012bb al-Tahdh\u012bb'' and [[al-Dhahabi]]'s ''Tadhkirat al-huffaz''.<ref>See:\n* Robinson (2003) pp. 69\u201370;\n* Lucas (2004) p. 15</ref>\n\n===Scale of transmission===\nHadith on matters of importance needed to come through a number of independent chains,<ref name=\"Shafi\"/> this was known as the scale of transmission. Reports that passed through many reliable transmitters in many ''isnad'' up until their collection and transcription are known as ''[[Hadith terminology#Mutawatir|mutaw\u0101tir]]''. These reports are considered the most authoritative as they pass through so many different routes that collusion between all of the transmitters becomes an impossibility. Reports not meeting this standard are known  as ''[[Hadith terminology#Ahaad|aahad]]'', and are of several different types.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/>\n\n===Analyzing text===\nAccording to Muhammad Shafi, Hadith whose isnad has been scrutinized then have their text or ''matn'' examined for\n*contradiction of the Quran<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*contradiction of reliable hadith<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*making sense, being logical<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n*being a report about the importance of an individual (or individuals) which is transmitted only through their supporters or family, and which is not supported by reports from other independent channels.<ref name=\"Shafi\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Joseph Schacht]] states that the \"whole technical criticism of traditions ... is mainly based on criticism of isnads\", which he (and others) believe to be ineffective in eliminating fraudulent hadith.<ref name=\"[Schacht-1950_163]\">{{cite book| last1=Schacht |first1=Joseph |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |date=1950 |p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology: admissible and inadmissible hadiths===\n{{Main|Hadith terminology}}\nHaving been evaluated, hadith may be categorized.

'Provided the chain was uninterrupted and its individual links deemed trustworthy persons, the Hadith was accepted as binding law.

Then the generation following them received it, thus conveying it to those after them and so on. So a companion would say, \"I heard the Prophet say such and such.\" The Follower would then say, \"I heard a companion say, 'I heard the Prophet.'\" The one after him would then say, \"I heard someone say, 'I heard a Companion say, 'I heard the Prophet...''\" and so on.<ref>''Ilm al-Rijal wa Ahimiyatih'', by Mualami, p. 16, Dar al-Rayah.</ref>\n\n===Different schools===\nDifferent branches of Islam refer to different collections of hadith, though the same incident may be found in hadith in different collections:\n*In the Sunni branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[Kutub al-Sittah|the six books]]'', of which [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]] generally have the highest status. The other books of hadith are [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]] and [[Sunan ibn Majah]]. However the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four Sunni \"schools of thought\" (''[[madhhab]]s''), traditionally reject Sunan ibn Majah and assert the canonical status of [[Muwatta Imam Malik]].  \n*In the [[Twelver]] Shi'a branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[the Four Books]]'': [[Kitab al-Kafi]], [[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]], [[Tahdhib al-Ahkam]], and [[Al-Istibsar]]. \n*In the [[Ibadi]] branch of Islam, the main canonical collection is the [[Tartib al-Musnad]]. This is an expansion of the earlier [[Jami Sahih]] collection, which retains canonical status in its own right.\n*The [[Ismaili]] shia sects use the [[Daim al-Islam]] as hadith collections. \n*The [[Ahmadiyya]] sect generally rely on the Sunni canons.\n*Some minor groups, collectively known as [[Quranists]], reject the authority of the hadith collections altogether.<ref name=\"Aisha Y. Musa 2013\"/><ref name=\"Neal Robinson 2013 pp. 85-89\"/>\n\nIn general, the difference between Shi'a and Sunni collections is that Shia give preference to hadiths credited to the Prophet's family and close associates (''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]''), while Sunnis do not consider family lineage in evaluating hadith and sunnah narrated by any of twelve thousand companions of Muhammad.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=Religions.

Narrators who took the side of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] rather than [[Ali]], in the disputes over leadership that followed the death of Muhammad, are seen as unreliable by the Shia; narrations sourced to [[Ali]] and the family of Muhammad, and to their supporters, are preferred. Sunni scholars put trust in narrators such as [[Aisha]], whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\n\n====Extent and nature in the Sunni tradition====\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand,{{#tag:ref|See the references and discussion by Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah ''Thalathatu rasa'il fi ulum al-hadith; risalat abi dawud ila ahl makkata fi wasf sunanihi'', pg 36, footnote.

If,  say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century.

This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the place of departure for any serious study of hadith.

Some are more general, like the ''mu\u1e63annaf'', the ''mu\u02bfjam'', and the ''j\u0101mi\u02bf'', and some more specific, either characterized by the topics treated, like the ''sunan'' (restricted to legal-liturgical traditions), or by its composition, like the [[Forty hadith|''arba\u02bf\u012bniyy\u0101t'']] (collections of forty hadiths).<ref name=\"siddiqi\">Muhammad Zubayr Siddiqi, ''Hadith Literature'', Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1993, edited and revised by Abdal Hakim Murad.</ref>\n\n====Extent and nature in the Shia tradition====\nShi'a Muslims seldom if ever use the [[six major hadith collections]] followed by the Sunni, as they do not trust many of the Sunni narrators and transmitters. They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are [[The Four Books]], which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174\">Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.174.</ref> The Four Books are: ''Kitab al-Kafi'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''Al-Tahdhib'' and ''Al-Istibsar'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\n\nUnlike Sunnis, the majority of Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, every individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity. However, the Akhbari school does take all hadith from the four books as authentic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammad A. Shomali|title=Shi'i Islam: Origins, Faith and Practices|date=2003|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063117|page=35|edition=reprint}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of hadith in the Shia school of thought is well documented. This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our [[Shariah]] and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head. It will shine among the people gathered on the plain of resurrection.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/> [[Hassan al-Askari]], a descendant of Muhammad, gave support to this narration, stating \"Whoever he had taken out in the worldly life from the darkness of ignorance can hold to his light to be taken out of the darkness of the plain of resurrection to the garden (paradise). Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/>\n\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording hadith, it has been documented that [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the great grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light. Whatever agrees with the book of Allah you must take it and whatever disagrees you must leave it alone.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\">{{cite book|last1=ibn Ya\u2019qub al-Kulayni|first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad|title=Kitab al-Kafi|date=February 2013|publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9890016-2-5|edition=eBook}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Al-Baqir also emphasized the selfless devotion of Ahl al-Bayt to preserving the traditions of Muhammad through his conversation with [[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]], an old companion of Muhammad. He (Al-Baqir) said, \"Oh Jabir, had we spoken to you from our opinions and desires, we would be counted among those who are destroyed. We speak to you of the hadith which we treasure from the Messenger of Allah, Oh Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause, just as they treasure their gold and silver.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\" /> Further, it has been narrated that [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the son of al-Baqir, has said the following regarding hadith: \"You must write it down; you will not memorize until you write it down.\"<ref name= Kafi2013/>{{rp|33}}\n\n===Modern usage===\n[[File:Forty hadith nawawi taught by Sheikh Usama al Azhari in Sultan Hassan Mosque.JPG|thumb|[[Imam Nawawi's Forty Hadith]] taught in the [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan]] in Cairo, Egypt]]\nThe mainstream sects consider hadith to be essential supplements to, and clarifications of, the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as for clarifying issues pertaining to Islamic jurisprudence. [[Ibn al-Salah]], a hadith specialist, described the relationship between hadith and other aspect of the religion by saying: \"It is the science most pervasive in respect to the other sciences in their various branches, in particular to jurisprudence being the most important of them.\"<ref>''Ulum al-Hadith'' by Ibn al-Salah, p. 5, Dar al-Fikr, with the verification of Nur al-Din al-\u2018Itr.</ref> \"The intended meaning of 'other sciences' here are those pertaining to religion,\" explains Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, \"Quranic exegesis, hadith, and jurisprudence.

As for Quranic [[exegesis]], then the preferred manner of explaining the speech of God is by means of what has been accepted as a statement of Muhammad.

'Provided the chain was uninterrupted and its individual links deemed trustworthy persons, the Hadith was accepted as binding law. There could, by the terms of the religious faith itself, be no questioning of the content of the report; for this was the substance of divine revelation and therefore not susceptible to any form of legal or historical criticism,'\" according to scholar N.J. Coulson.<ref name=[183]-Coulson>N.J.

In 1969 the club purchased pitches at Kineton Road and started playing home games. Over three years' money was raised to build the club house which was constructed mainly by the players and was opened in 1972. Today the club plays in the Midland League and has three senior teams and a colts team.\n\n[[Southam United F.C.]] is the town's football club, and Southam also has a bowling club, a cricket club and the six pitch [[Dallas Burston Polo Club]] which includes conference and events facilities and the Millstone Hare pub and restaurant.\n\nSoutham is home to 2028 (Southam) Squadron Air Training Corps, an RAF-sponsored ([[Royal Air Force]]) youth organisation for 13- to 20-year-olds.

The water from the Well was said to cure eye complaints.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Holy Well and paths were renovated in 2007 using a National Lottery grant including wheelchair access and oak seats designed by artist Will Glanfield as part of his Southam Stories project, and fall within the unspoilt Stowe valley Area of Restraint as a protected landscape of special significance and value to the town.\n\nIn the 1540s [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] visited the town and described it as ''\"a modest market town of a single street\"''.{{sfn|Allen|2000|p=not cited}} [[William Shakespeare]] mentions Southam in ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]'', Act V, Scene I, Lines 10\u201316:\n\n<blockquote>\n''WARWICK''<br/>\n    Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?<br/>\n    And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?<br/>\n<br/>\n''SOMERSET''<br/>\n    At Southam I did leave him with his forces,<br/>\n    And do expect him here some two hours hence.<br/>\n<br/>\n''WARWICK''<br/>\n    Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.<br/>\n<br/>\n''SOMERSET''<br/>\n    It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:<br/>\n    The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.<br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nCharles I passed through Southam just before the outbreak of the Civil War and apparently was not made welcome by the townsfolk, who refused to ring the parish church bells.{{sfn|Allen|2000|p=not cited}} On 23 August 1642, the day after King Charles 1st formally declared war on Parliament, a skirmish was fought outside the town between [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces led by [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] and [[Cavalier|Royalist]] forces commanded by the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]]. The Battle of Southam is claimed by locals to have been the first battle of the English Civil Wars.

The [[Great Western Railway]] had absorbed the [[Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway]] in 1848, and when the GWR line to Birmingham opened in 1852 Southam had a station {{convert|3|mi|0}} to the south-west, named {{rws|Southam Road and Harbury}}. [[British Rail]]ways (BR) closed the station to goods in 1963 and passengers in 1964. The line is now part of the London Marylebone to Birmingham [[Chiltern Line]].\n\nThe [[London and North Western Railway]] completed its [[Weedon to Marton Junction Line]] in 1895 and opened {{rws|Southam and Long Itchington}} station on it {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of Southam.

The constituency was first contested in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]].\n\n[[RAF Southam]], about {{convert|0.6|mi|0}} east of the town, was a [[World War II]] airfield.

In 1969 the club purchased pitches at Kineton Road and started playing home games. Over three years' money was raised to build the club house which was constructed mainly by the players and was opened in 1972. Today the club plays in the Midland League and has three senior teams and a colts team.\n\n[[Southam United F.C.]] is the town's football club, and Southam also has a bowling club, a cricket club and the six pitch [[Dallas Burston Polo Club]] which includes conference and events facilities and the Millstone Hare pub and restaurant.\n\nSoutham is home to 2028 (Southam) Squadron Air Training Corps, an RAF-sponsored ([[Royal Air Force]]) youth organisation for 13- to 20-year-olds.
