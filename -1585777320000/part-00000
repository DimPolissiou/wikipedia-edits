{"title_page": "History of British Columbia", "text_new": "'''British Columbia''' is the westernmost province of [[Canada]]. Originally politically constituted as a pair of British colonies, [[British Columbia]] joined the [[Canadian Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. Perhaps the most influential historian of British Columbia has been [[Margaret Ormsby]]; in ''British Columbia: A History'' (1958) she presented a structural model that has been adopted by numerous historians and teachers. Chad Reimer says, \"in many aspects, it still has not been surpassed\". Ormsby posited a series of propositions that provided the dynamic to the history:\n\n<blockquote>the ongoing pull between maritime and continental forces; the opposition between a \"closed\", hierarchical model of society represented by the Hudson's Bay Company and colonial officials, and the \"open\", egalitarian vision of English and Canadian settlers, and regional tensions between Vancouver Island and mainland, metropolitan Vancouver and the hinterland interior.<ref>Chad Reimer \"Ormsby, Margaret A.\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA886|year=1999|page=886|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indigenous peoples==\n[[File:Tsimshian tea party.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tsimshian|Tsimshian people]] c. 1890, [[Metlakatla, British Columbia|Metlakatla]].]]\n\nHuman history in what has come to be known as British Columbia dates back thousands of years. Archaeology finds in British Columbia have been dated to as early as 13,500 years ago, with some exciting potential for underwater sites beginning to be detected.\n\nThe geography of the land influenced the cultural development of the peoples - and in places, allowed for the cultural development of permanent villages, complex social institutions and a huge range of languages. BC is divided by anthropological theory into three cultural areas - the Northwest Coast, The Plateau and the North. First Nations in each area developed customs and approaches to living that fit the resources in the region. Through much of British Columbia salmon are available and formed a substantial part of the diet where available. The term pre-contact is used to describe the time period prior to contact between First Nations and European explorers. The precise time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the 1770s and 1800. In places in the Interior, it occurred later.\n\nBritish Columbia, before the arrival of the Europeans, was home to many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indigenous peoples]] speaking more than 30 different languages, including [[Babine-Witsuwit'en language|Babine-Witsuwit'en]], [[Danezaa language|Danezaa (Beaver)]], [[Carrier language|Carrier]], [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Dene language]], [[Gitxsan language|Gitxsan]], [[Haida language|Haida]], [[Haisla language|Haisla]], [[Halkomelem]], [[Kaska language|Kaska]], [[Kutenai language|Kutenai]], [[Kwakwa\u0331ka\u0331'wakw language|Kwak\u0313wala]], [[Lillooet language|Lillooet]], [[Nisga'a language|Nisga'a]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nuu-chah-nulth]], [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]], [[Saanich language|SENCOTEN]], [[Sekani language|Sekani]], [[Shuswap language|Shuswap]], [[Sinixt dialect|Sinixt]], [[Squamish language|Squamish]], [[Tagish language|Tagish]], [[Tahltan language|Tahltan]], [[Thompson language|Thompson]], [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]], [[Tsetsaut]], and [[Tsimshianic languages|Tsimshian]]. There was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca were common.\n\nThe abundance of natural resources, such as salmon and cedar, enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities. With so much food being available, the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art, politics, and warfare.\n\n==Early Spanish explorers==\nThe first European visitors to present-day British Columbia were Spanish sailors and other European sailors who sailed for the Spanish crown. There is some evidence that the Greek-born [[Juan de Fuca]], who sailed for Spain and explored the West coast of North America in the 1590s, might have reached the passageway between Washington State and Vancouver Island\u2014today known as the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/juan-de-fuca|title=Juan de Fuca {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> (A later British explorer named [[Charles William Barkley]] named the passage after Juan de Fuca's reputed visit.)\n\nThere is actually no evidence that [[Juan de Fuca]] arrived in British Columbia. He invented a popular fiction known as the Strait of Ainan in 1560, which captured the minds of Europeans looking for a quick, direct route from Europe to China. This became known as the [[Northwest Passage]], a dangerous sea-ice covered route through the Arctic Circle which only ninety-four boats have ever made after the great Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s three-year expedition from 1903\u20131906. The Spanish and the British sent several expeditions to find this semi-mythical Northwest Passage, including James Cook's 1778 expedition. If Juan de Fuca were to be believed, he would have crossed the Arctic Ocean in 1560. While Europeans knew about the Northwest Passage, with [[John Cabot]]'s failed 1497 expedition being the first attempt to pass it which ultimately lead to the explorer's death. This is further complicated by the fact that controversy exists as to whether or not [[Juan de Fuca]] was even a real person, with some scholars doubting that he actually exists [[Juan de Fuca#Controversy]].\n\nThere is not much evidence to suggest that European traders and explorers regularly came to present-day British Columbia in the 17th century\u2014The first recorded European discovery of British Columbia was by James Cook in 1778.\n\nThe arrival of Europeans began to intensify in the mid-18th century, as [[fur trade]]rs entered the area to harvest [[sea otter]]s. While there is a theory and some evidence that [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the [[British Columbia Coast]] in 1579,<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/book-review-the-secret-voyage-of-sir-francis-drake/ ''Book Review: The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake'', ''Macleans'' magazine, July 18, 2003, quoted entire in ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-francis-drake/ ''Sir Francis Drake'' article, ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573229/Amateur-treasure-hunter-turns-Canadian-history-head-finding-435-year-old-British-shilling-buried-clay.html ''Another victory for Drake: Amateur treasure hunter's coin find proves English hero discovered Canada before the Spanish'', AP Reporter, ''Daily Mail'', London, March 14 2014]</ref> it is conventionally claimed that it was [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1775 [citation needed]. In doing so, Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the whole of the Pacific coast, first made by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in 1513, who declared the whole of the Pacific and its shores as part of the Spanish Empire. Quadra sailed over Sonora Reef, named after his boat, on [[Destruction Island]] in 1775. His crew were murdered by the cannibal natives on the beach, and they attempted to board his ship until his crew destroyed them with cannon-fire. Quadra left the coast of Washington and sailed to Sitka, Alaska, but he did not make landfall or \"discover\" British Columbia. It was not until [[Captain James Cook]]'s doomed third expedition that British Columbia was \"discovered\" when he anchored in Friendly Cove, modern-day Nootka Sound.\n\nIn 1774, the Spanish navigator [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez]], a native of [[Mexico]], sailed from [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], [[Nueva Galicia]] (modern-day [[Nayarit]]), with instructions to reach 60\u00b0 north [[latitude]] to discover possible Russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the Spanish Crown.

After illnesses, storms, and other troubles had affected the expedition, de Heceta returned to Nueva Galicia, while Quadra kept on a northward course, ultimately reaching 59\u00b0 North in what today is [[Sitka, Alaska]].<ref>[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5688 The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History]</ref> During this expedition, the Spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the Spanish Crown, while verifying the absence of Russian settlements along the coast [citation needed]. \nThree years later, in 1778, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in the region, searching for the [[Northwest Passage]], and successfully landed at [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]], where he and his crew traded with the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] [[First Nations|First Nation]]. Upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts, his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in [[Macau]] on their way back to Britain. This led to an influx of traders to the British Columbian coast, and ongoing economic contact with the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] peoples there.\n\n== Early European villages (1788\u20131790s) ==\n[[File:Nootka Sound NASA.PNG|thumb|left|[[Nootka Sound]] marked in [[Vancouver Island]].]]\n[[File:Spanish fort San Miguel at Nootka in 1793.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of [[Fort San Miguel]].]]\n[[File:Vancouver-friendly-cove.jpg|thumb|right|[[Friendly Cove]], [[Nootka Sound]]. Volume I, plate VII from: \"A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World\" by [[George Vancouver]].]]\nIn 1788, [[John Meares]], an English navigator and explorer, sailed from China and explored [[Nootka Sound]] and the neighbouring coasts. He bought some land from a local chief named [[Maquinna]] and built a [[trading post]] there.\n\nTwo years later, in 1789, the Spanish commander [[Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]], a native of [[Seville]], established a settlement and started building a [[fort]] in [[Friendly Cove]], [[Nootka Sound]], which was named [[Fort San Miguel]]. This territory was already considered as part of [[New Spain]] by the Spanish due to the previous explorations of the region. Upon Martinez's arrival, a number of British ships were seized, including those of Captain Meares. This originated the [[Nootka Crisis]], which almost led to a war between Britain and Spain. The controversy resulted in the abandonment of the Nootka Sound settlement by the Spanish. Some months later, [[Manuel Antonio Fl\u00f3rez]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]], ordered a [[Francisco de Eliza]] to rebuild the [[fort]]. The expedition, composed of three ships, the ''Concepci\u00f3n'', under the command of [[Francisco de Eliza|De Eliza]], the ''San Carlos'', under the command of [[Salvador Fidalgo]] and the ''[[Princess Royal (1778 sloop)|Princesa Real]]'', under the command of [[Manuel Quimper]], sailed in early 1790 from [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]] in Nueva Galicia and arrived at Nootka Sound in April of that year. The expedition had many [[Catalan people|Catalan volunteers]] from the [[First Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia]], commanded by [[Pere d'Albern\u00ed]], a native of [[Tortosa]]. The expedition rebuilt the fort, which had been dismantled after Mart\u00ednez abandoned it. The rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a [[vegetable garden]] to ensure the settlement had food supplies. The Catalan volunteers left the fort in 1792 and Spanish influence in the region ended in 1795 after the [[Nootka Convention]] came into force.<ref>[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf ''Catalans al Canad\u00e0'', page 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030000815/http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf |date=2008-10-30 }}, study from the [http://www.histocat.cat ''Fundaci\u00f3 d'Estudis Hist\u00f2rics de Catalunya'']</ref>\n\n==Late British expeditions (1790s\u20131821)==\nSubsequently, European explorer-merchants from the east started to discover British Columbia. Three figures dominate in the early history of mainland British Columbia: [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]. As employees of the [[North West Company]], the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the Pacific, specifically via the [[Columbia River]], for the extension of the [[fur trade]]. In 1793, Mackenzie became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the [[Rio Grande]]. He and his crew entered the region through the [[Rocky Mountains]] via the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]], reaching the ocean at [[North Bentinck Arm]], near present-day [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion, [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], founded the first permanent European settlement in British Columbia, [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]], located at the junction of the [[Beatton River|Beatton]] and Peace Rivers.\n\nSimon Fraser was the next to try to find the course of the Columbia. During his expedition of 1805\u201309, Fraser and his crew, including [[John Stuart (explorer)|John Stuart]], explored much of the British Columbia interior, establishing several forts ([[Hudson's Hope]], [[McLeod Lake|Trout Lake Fort]], [[Prince George, British Columbia|Fort George]], [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]], and [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]]). Fraser's expedition took him down the [[Fraser River|river]] that now bears his name, to the site of present-day Vancouver. Although both Mackenzie and Fraser reached the Pacific, they found the routes they took impassable for trade. It was David Thompson who found the Columbia River and followed it down to its mouth in 1811. He was unable to establish a claim, however, for the American explorers [[Lewis and Clark]] had already claimed the territory for the United States of America six years earlier. The [[American Fur Company]] of [[John Jacob Astor]] had founded [[Fort Astoria]] just months before Thompson arrived, though within a year the local staff at Astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the North West Company, which renamed it Fort George. Though \"returned\" to US hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the [[War of 1812]], this meant only there was a parallel US fort adjacent to the NWC one, which was the more prosperous of the two.<!--other NWC forts at Okanagan and Kamloops etc--> Following the forced merger of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, [[Fort Vancouver]] was established as the new regional headquarters.\n\n==From fur trade districts to colonies (1821\u20131858)==\nAlthough technically a part of [[British North America]], British Columbia was largely run by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] after its merger with the North West Company in 1821. The [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior]] of the region was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] District, a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole. It was administered from Fort St. James, about 150&nbsp;km northwest of present-day [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]]. The [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] south of the [[Thompson River]] and north of [[California]] was named by the company the [[Columbia District]], and was administered first from [[Fort Vancouver]] (present day [[Vancouver, Washington]]).\n\nThroughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], based out of the company headquarters at [[Fort Vancouver]] on the [[Columbia River]]. Although authority over the region was nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], company policy, enforced via Chief Factor [[John McLoughlin]] of the company's [[Columbia District]], was to discourage any settlement, including US settlement, of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region. It established [[Fort Boise]] in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American [[Fort Hall]], {{convert|483|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east. In 1837, it purchased Fort Hall, also along the route of the [[Oregon Trail]], where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.\n\nFort Vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Also, for many primarily American settlers the fort became the last stop on the [[Oregon Trail]] as they could get supplies before starting their homestead.\n\nBy 1843 the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] operated numerous posts in the Columbia Department, including Fort Vancouver, [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] (Astoria), [[Fort Nisqually]], [[Fort Umpqua]], [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]], [[Fort Colville]], [[Fort Okanogan]], Fort [[Kamloops]], [[Alexandria, British Columbia|Fort Alexandria]], [[Saleesh House|Flathead Post]], [[Kootanae House]], [[Fort Boise]], [[Fort Hall]], [[Lax Kw'alaams, British Columbia|Fort Simpson]], [[Fort Durham|Fort Taku]], [[Fort McLoughlin]] (in [[Milbanke Sound]]), [[Wrangell, Alaska|Fort Stikine]], as well as a number of others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0613-8 |page=250}} online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKXgJw6K088C Google Books]</ref>\n\nA very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in BC; a response to this was the development of a trade jargon, [[Chinook Jargon]]. Not a complete language, it was used in trade, governance and some early writings, for example hymns.\n\n{{quote|By 1811 John Jacob Astor had founded Astoria, and ten years later the Hudson's Bay Company had established itself on the Columbia. In the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land. Somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the (Chinook) Jargon became known. All the Indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites. Knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the trader's equipment.<ref>Thomas, Edward Harper. ''Chinook: A History and Dictionary''. Portland, Ore. Winford & Morts. 1935. {{ISBN|0-8323-0217-1}}</ref>}}\n\nFort Victoria was established as a trading post in 1843, both as a means to protect HBC interests, as well as to assert British claims to Vancouver Island and the adjacent [[Gulf Islands]]. The Gulf Islands and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] are the access point to [[Puget Sound]] as well as a fall back position in preparation for the \"worst case\" scenario settlement of the dispute, in the face of [[manifest destiny]]. Increasing numbers of American settlers arriving on the [[Oregon Trail]] gave rise to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The Hudson's Bay Company dominated and controlled all territory north of the Columbia River. The British position was that a fair division of the Columbia District was a boundary at the Columbia River.\n\nIn 1844, the [[United States Democratic Party]] asserted that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire [[Columbia District]] or [[Oregon Country]], but President [[James K. Polk|James Polk]] was prepared to draw the border along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], the longstanding U.S. proposal. When the British rejected this offer, Polk broke off negotiations, and American expansionists reasserted the claim, coining slogans (most famously \"[[Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!]]\"). With the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] diverting attention and resources, Polk was again prepared to compromise. The [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled in the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty|Treaty of Washington]]. The terms of the agreement established the border between British North America and the United States at the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the sea, the original American proposal, with all of Vancouver Island retained as British territory.\n\nThis effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the HBC's Columbia Department, since the lower Columbia River was the core and lifeline of the system. The U.S. soon organized its portion as the [[Oregon Territory]]. The administrative headquarters of fur operations, and of the Columbia Department, then shifted north to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Fort Victoria]], which had been founded by [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]].\n\n{{anchor|Douglas Treaties}}\nIn 1849, the Crown [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created; and in 1851, [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] was appointed Governor. Douglas, known as the father of British Columbia, established colonial institutions in Victoria. He started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing 14 treaties between 1850\u20131854 to purchase land for settlement and industrial development (coal deposits were known by the HWBC in the vicinities of Nanaimo and [[Fort Rupert, British Columbia|Fort Rupert]]).<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091903/http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/treaty/landmark/douglas/default.html |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/treaty/landmark/douglas/default.html |title=Douglas Treaties: 1850-1854 |publisher=Gov.bc.ca }}</ref> Subsequent native population crashes later in the 19th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with British principles, treaties, and [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|laws]].\n\nMeanwhile, on the mainland, [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] continued to focus on the fur trade with few non-native inhabitants (mostly HBC employees and their families){{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} under the administrative oversight of Douglas, who was also the HBC's regional chief executive. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] like the previous French colony and [[North West Company]] of [[Montreal]] still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. The fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local HBC trading fort and adjacent native tribes. American expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population.<ref>The Canadian Frontier 1534-1760 by W.J. Eccles.</ref><ref>Superior Rendezvous Place Fort William in the Canadian Fur Trade by J. Morrison</ref> The British made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]] of the area. In accordance with the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], large-scale settlement by non-aboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by [[treaty]].\n\n==Colonial British Columbia (1858\u20131871)==\nIn 1858,<!--1857 I think actually, for the Nicoamen strike; gold had been found for years before but never by Americans--> [[gold]] was found along the banks of the [[Thompson River]] just east of what is now [[Lytton, British Columbia]], triggering the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. When word got out to [[San Francisco]] about gold in British territory, Victoria was transformed overnight into a tent city as [[prospecting|prospectors]], speculators, land agents, and outfitters flooded in from around the world, mostly via [[San Francisco]]. The Hudson's Bay Company's [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]] burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the Canyon.\n\nA wide range of linguistic diversity among First Nations and explorers/traders made communication difficult. Trade jargon, initially used by First Nations expanded and changed to include words from English and French to become the [[Chinook Jargon]]. Not a complete language, the jargon became widespread among First Nations and early Europeans to enable communication and trade. Though little used today a significant number of place names in British Columbia derive from Chinook and early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon.\n\nAt the time, the region was still not under formal colonial authority. Douglas, fearing challenges to the claim of British sovereignty in the region in the face of an influx of some 20,000 Americans, stationed a gunboat at the mouth of the Fraser in order to obtain license fees from those seeking to head upstream.

He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \"Mary Hill\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \"government reserves\", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.\n\nBy 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864.

The influx of gold miners into B.C.'s economy led to the creation of basic [[infrastructure]] in B.C., most notably, the creation of the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]] which linked the [[Lower Mainland]] to the rich gold fields of [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. However, the enormous costs of the road, and its predecessor the [[Douglas Road]] and services such as the [[Gold Escort]], left B.C. in debt by the mid-1860s. In 1866, because of the massive debt left over from the gold rush, the mainland and Vancouver Island became [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|one colony named British Columbia]], with its capital in Victoria.\n\nOn Vancouver Island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines. For example, see the 19th century settlement in [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]] or [[Colony of Vancouver Island]].\n\n===Annexation debate===\nIn 1867, there were three options open: to continue as a British colony, to be [[Annexation movements of Canada|annexed by the United States]], or to confederate with the newly formed Dominion of Canada.<ref>Jean Barman, ''The West Beyond the West: A History of British Columbia'' (1991) p. 91</ref><ref>Charles Hou and Marlena Morgan, eds.

That said, annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the United States a free trade agreement similar to the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1854]], and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the American tariff. Most Canadian-born residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular, as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in British Columbia as the American-born colonists did. Residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of British North America; they argued that this would benefit the colony as Canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty.

The Confederation League, spearheaded by three future premiers of the province \u2014 [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[Robert Beaven]], and [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]] \u2014 took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal. And so it was on July 20, 1871, that British Columbia became the sixth province to join Canada. In return for entering Confederation, Canada absorbed B.C.'s massive debt, and promised to build a railway from [[Montreal]] to the Pacific coast within 10 years.\n\nContrary to popular belief British Columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation; its delegates expected a wagon road, but [[John A. Macdonald]]'s national government proposed the railroad as a substitute, with Ottawa and London viewing it as a way of connecting not just British Columbia but the prairies with the rest of the British Empire.{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|235\u2013236}} The promise of a railroad became, however, the most important reason for British Columbia to stay within Canada. The provincial legislature threatened to secede in 1878 because Macdonald's successor [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], whose [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] had opposed the railroad, attempted to modify the promise; Macdonald's return to power that year likely kept British Columbia from departing Canada.{{r|keenlyside1952}}{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|236\u2013238}} In fulfillment of the promise, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|last spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was driven in [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]] on 7 November 1885. (No good road yet existed between British Columbia and other provinces; until the completion of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] automobiles had to enter the United States to travel to eastern Canada.){{r|howay1942}}{{rp|240\u2013241,406}}\n\nThe mining frontier in B.C. led to the creation of many mines and smelters, mostly through American investment. One of the world's largest smelters still exists today in [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]]. The capital and work to be found in B.C. during the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century led to the creation of several new towns in B.C. such as [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], [[Nakusp, British Columbia|Nakusp]], [[Slocan, British Columbia|Slocan]], [[Kimberley, British Columbia|Kimberley]], [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], [[Rossland, British Columbia|Rossland]], and [[Salmo, British Columbia|Salmo]]. A large [[coal]] empire run by [[Robert Dunsmuir]], and his son and later premier, [[James Dunsmuir]] also developed on Vancouver Island during this era.\n\nAs the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement, other resource-based economic activity began to flourish. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, [[fishery|fishing]], [[logging|forestry]], and [[agriculture|farming]] (including the planting of extensive [[orchard]]s in the [[Okanagan]] region) became the \"three F's\" on which the new province built its economy \u2014 a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century.\n\nWith the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities (such as Victoria, [[Nanaimo]], and [[Kamloops]]). It also led to the establishment of new communities, such as Yale, New Westminster, and \u2014 most notably, though a latecomer \u2014 Vancouver. The product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of Granville and Hastings Mill located near the mouth of the Fraser on [[Burrard Inlet]] in the later 1860s, Vancouver was incorporated in 1886 following its selection as the railhead for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later, Vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province, its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail, to markets overseas. Vancouver's status as the principal city in the province has endured, augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Burnaby]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[New Westminster]]. Today, [[Metro Vancouver]] is the third most populous metropolitan area in Canada, behind Toronto and [[Montreal]].\n\nIt was also during this period where ethnic diversity began to develop significantly, as immigration was not fed entirely by European countries. Chinese and Japanese emigrants made many coastal settlements home, beginning in the 1850s, and became increasingly more pronounced in the 1880s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Indian emigrants also began sailing to British Columbia in the following years, and would help develop the provincial logging industry.<ref>Pontellini, Michaela. \"[http://vancouverweekly.com/the-history-of-punjabis-in-british-columbia/ The History of Punjabis in British Columbia]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6TPriFO2n?url=http://vancouverweekly.com/the-history-of-punjabis-in-british-columbia/ Archive]) (book review).

From the canneries to the mills and mines, B.C.'s resource sector was increasingly the domain of large commercial interests.\n\nWith industrialization and economic growth, workers arrived to join in the seemingly boundless prosperity. Increasingly, these workers came from Asia as well as Europe. The mix of cultures and diversity was a source of strength, but also, often, of conflict. The early part of the 20th century was a time of great change and talk between immigrants and the First Nations, all of whom found their lives changing rapidly.\n\n===Rise of the labour movement===\nThe dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant [[Trades and Labour Congress of Canada|labour movement]]. The first major sympathy [[strike action|strike]] was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition.

Racism and a desire to create a white colony were widespread. The scientific thinking of Charles Darwin was used to develop a theory of the races, which is today completely discredited - came to be known as [[Social Darwinism]].\n\nUnder the ideology of Social Darwinism a series of restrictive laws were passed, by both federal and provincial levels of government. The [[Potlatch Ban]] outlawed First Nations cultural and spiritual practices,<ref>Cole, Douglas & Ira Chaiken 'An Iron Hand Upon the People: The Law against the Potlatch on the Northwest Coast.' Douglas & McIntyre. Vancouver. 1990</ref> non-white people were denied the vote - specifically First Nations, Chinese and Japanese people were not eligible to vote.\n\nDuring the 20th century, many immigrant groups arrived in British Columbia and today, Vancouver is the second most ethnically diverse city in Canada, only behind Toronto. Vancouver in particular has a long history of Chinese and Indian settlement; today, ethnic [[Chinese Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Chinese]] and [[South Asian Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Indians]] form over 30% of the city's population.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=5915&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Greater%20Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Visible%20minority&TABID=1 Census Profile, 2016 Census: Greater Vancouver, Regional district].

By 1923 the government passed the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]], which prohibited all Chinese immigration until 1947. [[Sikh]]s from [[British Raj|British India]] had to face an amended Immigration Act in 1908 that required [[Overseas Indians|Indians]] to have $200 on arrival in Canada, and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from India, which was impossible. Perhaps the most famous incident of anti-Indian racism in B.C. was in 1914 when the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in Vancouver harbour with 376 [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] Sikhs, [[Punjabi Muslims|Muslims]] and [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] aboard, of whom only 20 were allowed entry. The ''Komagata Maru'' spent two months in harbour while the [[Khalsa Society]] went through the courts to appeal their case. The Khalsa Society also kept the passengers on the ''Komagata Maru'' alive during those two months. When the case was lost, {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] cruiser, escorted the ''Komagata Maru'' out to sea while thousands of Caucasians cheered from the seawall of [[Stanley Park]].\n\nDuring the Second World War, security concerns following the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] and Canada's entry into the war versus Japan led to controversial measures. The local Japanese-Canadian population was openly discriminated against, being put in [[Concentration camp#Canada|internment camps]]. The [[Pacific Coast Militia Rangers]] were formed in 1942 in order to provide an armed presence on the coast in addition to the pre-war fortress garrisons, which were expanded after hostilities. Japanese military attacks against BC amounted to a small number of parachute bombs released from great distance away and by the middle of 1942 the threat of direct attack diminished following defeat at the [[Battle of Midway]] by US forces.\n\n===Prohibition===\n[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] was prohibited in British Columbia for about four years, from 1917 to 1921. A referendum in 1916 asked BC citizens whether they approved of making alcohol illegal (the other question was whether women had the right to vote). The contested results rejecting [[prohibition]] led to a major political scandal that subsequently saw the referendum being overturned and alcohol prohibited.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/part1-24.html |title=\"Electoral History,\" Elections BC |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011154204/http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/part1-24.html |archive-date=2006-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, by 1921 the failures were so apparent&mdash;a thriving black market, arbitrary (often class- and race-based) enforcement and punishment, rampant corruption&mdash;that alcohol was established as a commodity subject to government regulation and taxation as it is today. U.S. prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s led to a thriving business of producing and smuggling alcohol to quench the thirst of BC's southern neighbors. Many of Vancouver's richest families built or consolidated their fortunes in the rum-running business. Some compare today's robust [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-growing industry in BC (the number-one cash crop) to this earlier era.<ref name=\"Haddow\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/05/marijuana-industry-canada|title=Marijuana may cause Canada's economic comedown|last=Haddow|first=Douglas|date=5 August 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===World War II contributions===\n\nA [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] was created in 1942 also, and was disbanded in 1945. During the war a range of coastal defences were constructed, including harbour defences for Vancouver. Today's [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]] sits atop the foundation for gun batteries that were used to command Vancouver Harbour approaches.\n\nMilitia units from southern BC provided cadres for many regiments that eventually fought in Europe. The [[Rocky Mountain Rangers]] sent a battalion to fight the Japanese in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands]] in 1943. Thousands more British Columbians volunteered for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

With few exceptions (the Douglas Treaties of Fort Rupert and southern Vancouver Island) no treaties were signed. Some early settlers assumed, based on the catastrophic population crash of First Nations peoples linked to smallpox, and racist ideas that 'Indians' were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the 'Indian Land Question'.\n\nUpon Confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for Indians and lands reserved for Indians, while the province had responsibility for non-Aboriginal civil matters and resources. The 1913 [[McKenna-McBride Royal Commission]] made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and First Nations rights. Several delegations to Ottawa and London were sent by First Nations seeking redress for grievances, to little avail. Instead the Indian Act, federal legislation governing First Nations, was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council. Other oppressive measures also accompanied the amendment including the [[Potlatch Ban]] and the increasingly applied [[Indian Residential School]] system designed to assimilate First Nations.\n\nThe status of the [[First Nations]] (Aboriginal) people of British Columbia is a long-standing problem that has become a major issue in recent years. First Nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base. They were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways. In many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments. Status Indians gained the right to vote in 1960. They were prohibited from possessing alcohol, which rather than preventing problems with this drug, exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinking.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Certain privileges of status Indians are governed by the [[Indian Act]]. With the exception of what are known as the [[Douglas Treaties]], negotiated by Sir James Douglas with the native people of the [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] area, no treaties were signed in British Columbia until 1998. Many native people wished to negotiate treaties, but the province refused until 1990. Another major development was the 1997 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the ''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' case that aboriginal title still exists in British Columbia.\n\n60% of First Nations in British Columbia are aligned with the First Nations Summit. This brings a total of 58 First Nations, but only 20 are said to be in active negotiations. Three Final Agreements have been settled, with one being rejected by [[Lheidli T'enneh]] in 2007. The other two, the Maa-nulth treaty group, a 5 Nuu-chah-nulth member group, and the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]]. Although these treaties have yet to be ratified by Parliament in Ottawa and Legislature in Victoria, neighbouring First Nations are seeking to block these treaties in the courts. A group of Vancouver Island and some mainland First Nations, the [[WSANEC]], [[Lekwungen]], and [[Semiahmoo First Nation|Semiahmoo]], are seeking to block to Tsawwassen First Nation treaty, claiming infringement on their rights and land titles. On the west coast of Vancouver Island, the [[Ditidaht]] First Nation is doing the same against the Maa-nulth treaty group. The only treaty signed in recent years, the [[Nisga'a Final Agreement|Nisga'a Treaty]] (1998), was negotiated outside of the current [[British Columbia Treaty Process|treaty process]]. There is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations. Among indigenous people, there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of [[Aboriginal title]] and continued [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government. Therefore, a substantial number of [[First Nations government]]s consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nA November 2007 court ruling for the [[Xeni Gwet'in First Nation]] called future participation in the process into question. The judge ruled that the [[Xeni Gwet'in]] could demonstrate [[aboriginal title]] to half of the [[Nemaia Valley]], and that the province had no power over these lands.<ref name=\"hugewin\">[http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=44bcbe05-644b-41ac-a8c2-168540b2342d Huge win for Interior natives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201193131/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=44bcbe05-644b-41ac-a8c2-168540b2342d |date=2008-12-01 }}, [[The Province]], November 22, 2007</ref> Under the BC treaty process, negotiating nations have received as little as 5% of their claimed land recognized.

Archaeology finds in British Columbia have been dated to as early as 13,500 years ago, with some exciting potential for underwater sites beginning to be detected.\n\nThe geography of the land influenced the cultural development of the peoples - and in places, allowed for the cultural development of permanent villages, complex social institutions and a huge range of languages. BC is divided by anthropological theory into three cultural areas - the Northwest Coast, The Plateau and the North. First Nations in each area developed customs and approaches to living that fit the resources in the region. Through much of British Columbia salmon are available and formed a substantial part of the diet where available. The term pre-contact is used to describe the time period prior to contact between First Nations and European explorers. The precise time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the 1770s and 1800. In places in the Interior, it occurred later.\n\nBritish Columbia, before the arrival of the Europeans, was home to many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indigenous peoples]] speaking more than 30 different languages, including [[Babine-Witsuwit'en language|Babine-Witsuwit'en]], [[Danezaa language|Danezaa (Beaver)]], [[Carrier language|Carrier]], [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Dene language]], [[Gitxsan language|Gitxsan]], [[Haida language|Haida]], [[Haisla language|Haisla]], [[Halkomelem]], [[Kaska language|Kaska]], [[Kutenai language|Kutenai]], [[Kwakwa\u0331ka\u0331'wakw language|Kwak\u0313wala]], [[Lillooet language|Lillooet]], [[Nisga'a language|Nisga'a]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nuu-chah-nulth]], [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]], [[Saanich language|SENCOTEN]], [[Sekani language|Sekani]], [[Shuswap language|Shuswap]], [[Sinixt dialect|Sinixt]], [[Squamish language|Squamish]], [[Tagish language|Tagish]], [[Tahltan language|Tahltan]], [[Thompson language|Thompson]], [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]], [[Tsetsaut]], and [[Tsimshianic languages|Tsimshian]]. There was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca were common.\n\nThe abundance of natural resources, such as salmon and cedar, enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities. With so much food being available, the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art, politics, and warfare.\n\n==Early Spanish explorers==\nThe first European visitors to present-day British Columbia were Spanish sailors and other European sailors who sailed for the Spanish crown. There is some evidence that the Greek-born [[Juan de Fuca]], who sailed for Spain and explored the West coast of North America in the 1590s, might have reached the passageway between Washington State and Vancouver Island\u2014today known as the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/juan-de-fuca|title=Juan de Fuca {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> (A later British explorer named [[Charles William Barkley]] named the passage after Juan de Fuca's reputed visit.)\n\nThere is actually no evidence that [[Juan de Fuca]] arrived in British Columbia. He invented a popular fiction known as the Strait of Ainan in 1560, which captured the minds of Europeans looking for a quick, direct route from Europe to China. This became known as the [[Northwest Passage]], a dangerous sea-ice covered route through the Arctic Circle which only ninety-four boats have ever made after the great Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s three-year expedition from 1903-1906. The Spanish and the British sent several expeditions to find this semi-mythical Northwest Passage, including James Cook's 1778 expedition. If Juan de Fuca were to be believed, he would have crossed the Arctic Ocean in 1560. While Europeans knew about the Northwest Passage, with [[John Cabot]]'s failed 1497 expedition being the first attempt to pass it which ultimately lead to the explorer's death. This is further complicated by the fact that controversy exists as to whether or not [[Juan de Fuca]] was even a real person, with some scholars doubting that he actually exists [[Juan de Fuca#Controversy]].\n\nThere is not much evidence to suggest that European traders and explorers regularly came to present-day British Columbia in the 17th century\u2014The first recorded European discovery of British Columbia was by James Cook in 1778.\n\nThe arrival of Europeans began to intensify in the mid-18th century, as [[fur trade]]rs entered the area to harvest [[sea otter]]s. While there is a theory and some evidence that [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the [[British Columbia Coast]] in 1579,<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/book-review-the-secret-voyage-of-sir-francis-drake/ ''Book Review: The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake'', ''Macleans'' magazine, July 18, 2003, quoted entire in ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-francis-drake/ ''Sir Francis Drake'' article, ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573229/Amateur-treasure-hunter-turns-Canadian-history-head-finding-435-year-old-British-shilling-buried-clay.html ''Another victory for Drake: Amateur treasure hunter's coin find proves English hero discovered Canada before the Spanish'', AP Reporter, ''Daily Mail'', London, March 14 2014]</ref> it is conventionally claimed that it was [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1775 [citation needed]. In doing so, Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the whole of the Pacific coast, first made by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in 1513, who declared the whole of the Pacific and its shores as part of the Spanish Empire. Quadra sailed over Sonora Reef, named after his boat, on [[Destruction Island]] in 1775. His crew were murdered by the cannibal natives on the beach, and they attempted to board his ship until his crew destroyed them with cannon-fire. Quadra left the coast of Washington and sailed to Sitka, Alaska, but he did not make landfall or \"discover\" British Columbia. It was not until [[Captain James Cook]]'s doomed third expedition that British Columbia was \"discovered\" when he anchored in Friendly Cove, modern-day Nootka Sound.\n\nIn 1774, the Spanish navigator [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez]], a native of [[Mexico]], sailed from [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], [[Nueva Galicia]] (modern-day [[Nayarit]]), with instructions to reach 60\u00b0 north [[latitude]] to discover possible Russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the Spanish Crown. Hern\u00e1ndez reached 55\u00b0 north latitude, becoming the first European to sight the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] and [[Vancouver Island]]. He traded with the natives near [[Estevan Point]], although apparently without landing. The expedition was forced to return to Nueva Galicia, due to the lack of provisions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cicese.mx/mexico/bc/biografias/Juan_Jose_Perez.html |title=Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada |access-date=2007-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011953/http://www.cicese.mx/mexico/bc/biografias/Juan_Jose_Perez.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mvuchuck.com/historic.htm |title=Nootka Sound Service LTD's website |access-date=2007-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416205920/http://www.mvuchuck.com/historic.htm |archive-date=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez's first expedition failed to achieve its objective, the Spanish organized a second expedition in 1775 with the same goal.

After illnesses, storms, and other troubles had affected the expedition, de Heceta returned to Nueva Galicia, while Quadra kept on a northward course, ultimately reaching 59\u00b0 North in what today is [[Sitka, Alaska]].<ref>[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5688 The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History]</ref> During this expedition, the Spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the Spanish Crown, while verifying the absence of Russian settlements along the coast [citation needed]. \nThree years later, in 1778, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in the region, searching for the [[Northwest Passage]], and successfully landed at [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]], where he and his crew traded with the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] [[First Nations|First Nation]]. Upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts, his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in [[Macau]] on their way back to Britain. This led to an influx of traders to the British Columbian coast, and ongoing economic contact with the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] peoples there.\n\n== Early European villages (1788\u20131790s) ==\n[[File:Nootka Sound NASA.PNG|thumb|left|[[Nootka Sound]] marked in [[Vancouver Island]].]]\n[[File:Spanish fort San Miguel at Nootka in 1793.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of [[Fort San Miguel]].]]\n[[File:Vancouver-friendly-cove.jpg|thumb|right|[[Friendly Cove]], [[Nootka Sound]]. Volume I, plate VII from: \"A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World\" by [[George Vancouver]].]]\nIn 1788, [[John Meares]], an English navigator and explorer, sailed from China and explored [[Nootka Sound]] and the neighbouring coasts. He bought some land from a local chief named [[Maquinna]] and built a [[trading post]] there.\n\nTwo years later, in 1789, the Spanish commander [[Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]], a native of [[Seville]], established a settlement and started building a [[fort]] in [[Friendly Cove]], [[Nootka Sound]], which was named [[Fort San Miguel]]. This territory was already considered as part of [[New Spain]] by the Spanish due to the previous explorations of the region. Upon Martinez's arrival, a number of British ships were seized, including those of Captain Meares. This originated the [[Nootka Crisis]], which almost led to a war between Britain and Spain. The controversy resulted in the abandonment of the Nootka Sound settlement by the Spanish. Some months later, [[Manuel Antonio Fl\u00f3rez]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]], ordered a [[Francisco de Eliza]] to rebuild the [[fort]]. The expedition, composed of three ships, the ''Concepci\u00f3n'', under the command of [[Francisco de Eliza|De Eliza]], the ''San Carlos'', under the command of [[Salvador Fidalgo]] and the ''[[Princess Royal (1778 sloop)|Princesa Real]]'', under the command of [[Manuel Quimper]], sailed in early 1790 from [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]] in Nueva Galicia and arrived at Nootka Sound in April of that year. The expedition had many [[Catalan people|Catalan volunteers]] from the [[First Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia]], commanded by [[Pere d'Albern\u00ed]], a native of [[Tortosa]]. The expedition rebuilt the fort, which had been dismantled after Mart\u00ednez abandoned it. The rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a [[vegetable garden]] to ensure the settlement had food supplies. The Catalan volunteers left the fort in 1792 and Spanish influence in the region ended in 1795 after the [[Nootka Convention]] came into force.<ref>[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf ''Catalans al Canad\u00e0'', page 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030000815/http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf |date=2008-10-30 }}, study from the [http://www.histocat.cat ''Fundaci\u00f3 d'Estudis Hist\u00f2rics de Catalunya'']</ref>\n\n==Late British expeditions (1790s\u20131821)==\nSubsequently, European explorer-merchants from the east started to discover British Columbia. Three figures dominate in the early history of mainland British Columbia: [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]. As employees of the [[North West Company]], the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the Pacific, specifically via the [[Columbia River]], for the extension of the [[fur trade]]. In 1793, Mackenzie became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the [[Rio Grande]]. He and his crew entered the region through the [[Rocky Mountains]] via the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]], reaching the ocean at [[North Bentinck Arm]], near present-day [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion, [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], founded the first permanent European settlement in British Columbia, [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]], located at the junction of the [[Beatton River|Beatton]] and Peace Rivers.\n\nSimon Fraser was the next to try to find the course of the Columbia. During his expedition of 1805-09, Fraser and his crew, including [[John Stuart (explorer)|John Stuart]], explored much of the British Columbia interior, establishing several forts ([[Hudson's Hope]], [[McLeod Lake|Trout Lake Fort]], [[Prince George, British Columbia|Fort George]], [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]], and [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]]). Fraser's expedition took him down the [[Fraser River|river]] that now bears his name, to the site of present-day Vancouver. Although both Mackenzie and Fraser reached the Pacific, they found the routes they took impassable for trade. It was David Thompson who found the Columbia River and followed it down to its mouth in 1811. He was unable to establish a claim, however, for the American explorers [[Lewis and Clark]] had already claimed the territory for the United States of America six years earlier. The [[American Fur Company]] of [[John Jacob Astor]] had founded [[Fort Astoria]] just months before Thompson arrived, though within a year the local staff at Astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the North West Company, which renamed it Fort George. Though \"returned\" to US hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the [[War of 1812]], this meant only there was a parallel US fort adjacent to the NWC one, which was the more prosperous of the two.<!--other NWC forts at Okanagan and Kamloops etc--> Following the forced merger of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, [[Fort Vancouver]] was established as the new regional headquarters.\n\n==From fur trade districts to colonies (1821\u20131858)==\nAlthough technically a part of [[British North America]], British Columbia was largely run by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] after its merger with the North West Company in 1821. The [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior]] of the region was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] District, a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole. It was administered from Fort St. James, about 150&nbsp;km northwest of present-day [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]]. The [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] south of the [[Thompson River]] and north of [[California]] was named by the company the [[Columbia District]], and was administered first from [[Fort Vancouver]] (present day [[Vancouver, Washington]]).\n\nThroughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], based out of the company headquarters at [[Fort Vancouver]] on the [[Columbia River]]. Although authority over the region was nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], company policy, enforced via Chief Factor [[John McLoughlin]] of the company's [[Columbia District]], was to discourage any settlement, including US settlement, of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region. It established [[Fort Boise]] in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American [[Fort Hall]], {{convert|483|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east. In 1837, it purchased Fort Hall, also along the route of the [[Oregon Trail]], where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.\n\nFort Vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Also, for many primarily American settlers the fort became the last stop on the [[Oregon Trail]] as they could get supplies before starting their homestead.\n\nBy 1843 the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] operated numerous posts in the Columbia Department, including Fort Vancouver, [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] (Astoria), [[Fort Nisqually]], [[Fort Umpqua]], [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]], [[Fort Colville]], [[Fort Okanogan]], Fort [[Kamloops]], [[Alexandria, British Columbia|Fort Alexandria]], [[Saleesh House|Flathead Post]], [[Kootanae House]], [[Fort Boise]], [[Fort Hall]], [[Lax Kw'alaams, British Columbia|Fort Simpson]], [[Fort Durham|Fort Taku]], [[Fort McLoughlin]] (in [[Milbanke Sound]]), [[Wrangell, Alaska|Fort Stikine]], as well as a number of others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0613-8 |page=250}} online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKXgJw6K088C Google Books]</ref>\n\nA very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in BC; a response to this was the development of a trade jargon, [[Chinook Jargon]]. Not a complete language, it was used in trade, governance and some early writings, for example hymns.\n\n{{quote|By 1811 John Jacob Astor had founded Astoria, and ten years later the Hudson's Bay Company had established itself on the Columbia. In the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land. Somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the (Chinook) Jargon became known. All the Indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites. Knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the trader's equipment.<ref>Thomas, Edward Harper. ''Chinook: A History and Dictionary''. Portland, Ore. Winford & Morts. 1935. {{ISBN|0-8323-0217-1}}</ref>}}\n\nFort Victoria was established as a trading post in 1843, both as a means to protect HBC interests, as well as to assert British claims to Vancouver Island and the adjacent [[Gulf Islands]]. The Gulf Islands and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] are the access point to [[Puget Sound]] as well as a fall back position in preparation for the \"worst case\" scenario settlement of the dispute, in the face of [[manifest destiny]]. Increasing numbers of American settlers arriving on the [[Oregon Trail]] gave rise to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The Hudson's Bay Company dominated and controlled all territory north of the Columbia River. The British position was that a fair division of the Columbia District was a boundary at the Columbia River.\n\nIn 1844, the [[United States Democratic Party]] asserted that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire [[Columbia District]] or [[Oregon Country]], but President [[James K. Polk|James Polk]] was prepared to draw the border along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], the longstanding U.S. proposal. When the British rejected this offer, Polk broke off negotiations, and American expansionists reasserted the claim, coining slogans (most famously \"[[Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!]]\"). With the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] diverting attention and resources, Polk was again prepared to compromise. The [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled in the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty|Treaty of Washington]]. The terms of the agreement established the border between British North America and the United States at the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the sea, the original American proposal, with all of Vancouver Island retained as British territory.\n\nThis effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the HBC's Columbia Department, since the lower Columbia River was the core and lifeline of the system. The U.S. soon organized its portion as the [[Oregon Territory]]. The administrative headquarters of fur operations, and of the Columbia Department, then shifted north to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Fort Victoria]], which had been founded by [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]].\n\n{{anchor|Douglas Treaties}}\nIn 1849, the Crown [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created; and in 1851, [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] was appointed Governor. Douglas, known as the father of British Columbia, established colonial institutions in Victoria. He started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing 14 treaties between 1850\u20131854 to purchase land for settlement and industrial development (coal deposits were known by the HWBC in the vicinities of Nanaimo and [[Fort Rupert, British Columbia|Fort Rupert]]).<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091903/http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/treaty/landmark/douglas/default.html |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/treaty/landmark/douglas/default.html |title=Douglas Treaties: 1850-1854 |publisher=Gov.bc.ca }}</ref> Subsequent native population crashes later in the 19th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with British principles, treaties, and [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|laws]].\n\nMeanwhile, on the mainland, [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] continued to focus on the fur trade with few non-native inhabitants (mostly HBC employees and their families){{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} under the administrative oversight of Douglas, who was also the HBC's regional chief executive. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] like the previous French colony and [[North West Company]] of [[Montreal]] still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. The fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local HBC trading fort and adjacent native tribes. American expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population.<ref>The Canadian Frontier 1534-1760 by W.J. Eccles.</ref><ref>Superior Rendezvous Place Fort William in the Canadian Fur Trade by J. Morrison</ref> The British made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]] of the area. In accordance with the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], large-scale settlement by non-aboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by [[treaty]].\n\n==Colonial British Columbia (1858\u20131871)==\nIn 1858,<!--1857 I think actually, for the Nicoamen strike; gold had been found for years before but never by Americans--> [[gold]] was found along the banks of the [[Thompson River]] just east of what is now [[Lytton, British Columbia]], triggering the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. When word got out to [[San Francisco]] about gold in British territory, Victoria was transformed overnight into a tent city as [[prospecting|prospectors]], speculators, land agents, and outfitters flooded in from around the world, mostly via [[San Francisco]]. The Hudson's Bay Company's [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]] burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the Canyon.\n\nA wide range of linguistic diversity among First Nations and explorers/traders made communication difficult. Trade jargon, initially used by First Nations expanded and changed to include words from English and French to become the [[Chinook Jargon]]. Not a complete language, the jargon became widespread among First Nations and early Europeans to enable communication and trade. Though little used today a significant number of place names in British Columbia derive from Chinook and early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon.\n\nAt the time, the region was still not under formal colonial authority. Douglas, fearing challenges to the claim of British sovereignty in the region in the face of an influx of some 20,000 Americans, stationed a gunboat at the mouth of the Fraser in order to obtain license fees from those seeking to head upstream. The resolution of the [[Oregon Boundary Dispute]] whereby British interests, primarily the HBC, lost governance of all territory between the 49th Parallel and the Columbia River due to a sudden influx of American settlers 8 years previous.\n\n===Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers===\n\nWhen news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, the [[Colonial Office]] established the mainland as a Crown colony on August 2, 1858, naming it the [[Colony of British Columbia]].<ref>It was named after the Columbia Department of the Hudson's Bay Company, which in turn was named after the Columbia River.

Ormsby, author of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography entry for Moody (2002), condemns Moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city. However, most other historians have exonerated Moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive, especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of Douglas, whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development.

He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \"Mary Hill\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \"government reserves\", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.\n\nBy 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.\n[[File:Frederick Seymour.GIF|thumb|upright|Frederick Seymour, second governor of the Colony of British Columbia, and his cat.]]\n\n[[Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment]] was disbanded in July, 1863.

The influx of gold miners into B.C.'s economy led to the creation of basic [[infrastructure]] in B.C., most notably, the creation of the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]] which linked the [[Lower Mainland]] to the rich gold fields of [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. However, the enormous costs of the road, and its predecessor the [[Douglas Road]] and services such as the [[Gold Escort]], left B.C. in debt by the mid-1860s. In 1866, because of the massive debt left over from the gold rush, the mainland and Vancouver Island became [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|one colony named British Columbia]], with its capital in Victoria.\n\nOn Vancouver Island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines. For example, see the 19th century settlement in [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]] or [[Colony of Vancouver Island]].\n\n===Annexation debate===\nIn 1867, there were three options open: to continue as a British colony, to be [[Annexation movements of Canada|annexed by the United States]], or to confederate with the newly formed Dominion of Canada.<ref>Jean Barman, ''The West Beyond the West: A History of British Columbia'' (1991) p. 91</ref><ref>Charles Hou and Marlena Morgan, eds.

That said, annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the United States a free trade agreement similar to the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1854]], and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the American tariff. Most Canadian-born residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular, as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in British Columbia as the American-born colonists did. Residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of British North America; they argued that this would benefit the colony as Canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty. Many British-born colonists were on both sides.{{r|keenlyside1952}}{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|190\u2013192,208\u2013209}}\n\nRepresentative [[Nathaniel P.

The bill was unsuccessful, as was Senator [[Alexander Ramsey]] of Minnesota's 1867 proposal that the United States, as part of another reciprocity treaty with Canada, offer $6 million to the Hudson's Bay Company for the territory west of the 90th longitude. The US would assume British Columbia's $2 million debt, and subsidize the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to build a road to Puget Sound.{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|196\u2013198}} Two American military officers, who travelled throughout British Columbia for two months while arranging for supply of occupation troops in Alaska, wrote a detailed report to Washington in November 1867 of their belief that a majority of residents supported annexation.

Employees of the Hudson's Bay Company were said to be especially supportive, although they and many others could not make their opinion public because of fears of being denounced as disloyal.{{r|jstor40491056}} A majority of British Columbians never publicly supported American annexation, however, and support for joining Canada grew over time;{{r|jstor3633112}} in particular, annexationists failed to persuade the anti-confederation Hudson's Bay Company officials and their friends that dominated Vancouver Island politics.{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|209}} Accusations that \"American gold\" and \"American greenbacks\" funded \"renegade Englishmen\" likely hurt annexation support; whether the US officers' belief of the existence of widespread covert support was correct, by October 1867 annexation no longer appeared as a topic in British Columbia newspapers or documents.{{r|jstor40491056}}\n\nUntil the Alaska Purchase and the new Dominion status<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trotter | first1 = Reginald | year = 1935 | title = Canada as a Factor in Anglo-American Relations in the 1860s | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/708936fe391565f622a13ddd0af81c32c303d005| journal = Canadian Historical Review | volume = 16 | issue = | page = 354 | doi=10.3138/chr-16-01-02}}</ref> (which were almost simultaneous), the British had been indifferent to the fate of British Columbia.

The Confederation League, spearheaded by three future premiers of the province \u2014 [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[Robert Beaven]], and [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]] \u2014 took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal. And so it was on July 20, 1871, that British Columbia became the sixth province to join Canada. In return for entering Confederation, Canada absorbed B.C.'s massive debt, and promised to build a railway from [[Montreal]] to the Pacific coast within 10 years.\n\nContrary to popular belief British Columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation; its delegates expected a wagon road, but [[John A. Macdonald]]'s national government proposed the railroad as a substitute, with Ottawa and London viewing it as a way of connecting not just British Columbia but the prairies with the rest of the British Empire.{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|235\u2013236}} The promise of a railroad became, however, the most important reason for British Columbia to stay within Canada. The provincial legislature threatened to secede in 1878 because Macdonald's successor [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], whose [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] had opposed the railroad, attempted to modify the promise; Macdonald's return to power that year likely kept British Columbia from departing Canada.{{r|keenlyside1952}}{{r|howay1942}}{{rp|236\u2013238}} In fulfillment of the promise, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|last spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was driven in [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]] on 7 November 1885.

One of the world's largest smelters still exists today in [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]]. The capital and work to be found in B.C. during the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century led to the creation of several new towns in B.C. such as [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], [[Nakusp, British Columbia|Nakusp]], [[Slocan, British Columbia|Slocan]], [[Kimberley, British Columbia|Kimberley]], [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], [[Rossland, British Columbia|Rossland]], and [[Salmo, British Columbia|Salmo]]. A large [[coal]] empire run by [[Robert Dunsmuir]], and his son and later premier, [[James Dunsmuir]] also developed on Vancouver Island during this era.\n\nAs the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement, other resource-based economic activity began to flourish. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, [[fishery|fishing]], [[logging|forestry]], and [[agriculture|farming]] (including the planting of extensive [[orchard]]s in the [[Okanagan]] region) became the \"three F's\" on which the new province built its economy \u2014 a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century.\n\nWith the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities (such as Victoria, [[Nanaimo]], and [[Kamloops]]). It also led to the establishment of new communities, such as Yale, New Westminster, and \u2014 most notably, though a latecomer \u2014 Vancouver. The product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of Granville and Hastings Mill located near the mouth of the Fraser on [[Burrard Inlet]] in the later 1860s, Vancouver was incorporated in 1886 following its selection as the railhead for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later, Vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province, its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail, to markets overseas. Vancouver's status as the principal city in the province has endured, augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Burnaby]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[New Westminster]]. Today, [[Metro Vancouver]] is the third most populous metropolitan area in Canada, behind Toronto and [[Montreal]].\n\nIt was also during this period where ethnic diversity began to develop significantly, as immigration was not fed entirely by European countries. Chinese and Japanese emigrants made many coastal settlements home, beginning in the 1850s, and became increasingly more pronounced in the 1880s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Indian emigrants also began sailing to British Columbia in the following years, and would help develop the provincial logging industry.<ref>Pontellini, Michaela. \"[http://vancouverweekly.com/the-history-of-punjabis-in-british-columbia/ The History of Punjabis in British Columbia]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6TPriFO2n?url=http://vancouverweekly.com/the-history-of-punjabis-in-british-columbia/ Archive]) (book review).

From the canneries to the mills and mines, B.C.'s resource sector was increasingly the domain of large commercial interests.\n\nWith industrialization and economic growth, workers arrived to join in the seemingly boundless prosperity. Increasingly, these workers came from Asia as well as Europe. The mix of cultures and diversity was a source of strength, but also, often, of conflict. The early part of the 20th century was a time of great change and talk between immigrants and the First Nations, all of whom found their lives changing rapidly.\n\n===Rise of the labour movement===\nThe dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant [[Trades and Labour Congress of Canada|labour movement]].

Vancouver. 1990</ref> non-white people were denied the vote - specifically First Nations, Chinese and Japanese people were not eligible to vote.\n\nDuring the 20th century, many immigrant groups arrived in British Columbia and today, Vancouver is the second most ethnically diverse city in Canada, only behind Toronto. Vancouver in particular has a long history of Chinese and Indian settlement; today, ethnic [[Chinese Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Chinese]] and [[South Asian Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Indians]] form over 30% of the city's population.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=5915&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Greater%20Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Visible%20minority&TABID=1 Census Profile, 2016 Census: Greater Vancouver, Regional district].

By 1923 the government passed the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]], which prohibited all Chinese immigration until 1947. [[Sikh]]s from [[British Raj|British India]] had to face an amended Immigration Act in 1908 that required [[Overseas Indians|Indians]] to have $200 on arrival in Canada, and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from India, which was impossible. Perhaps the most famous incident of anti-Indian racism in B.C. was in 1914 when the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in Vancouver harbour with 376 [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] Sikhs, [[Punjabi Muslims|Muslims]] and [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] aboard, of whom only 20 were allowed entry. The ''Komagata Maru'' spent two months in harbour while the [[Khalsa Society]] went through the courts to appeal their case. The Khalsa Society also kept the passengers on the ''Komagata Maru'' alive during those two months. When the case was lost, {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] cruiser, escorted the ''Komagata Maru'' out to sea while thousands of Caucasians cheered from the seawall of [[Stanley Park]].\n\nDuring the Second World War, security concerns following the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] and Canada's entry into the war versus Japan led to controversial measures. The local Japanese-Canadian population was openly discriminated against, being put in [[Concentration camp#Canada|internment camps]]. The [[Pacific Coast Militia Rangers]] were formed in 1942 in order to provide an armed presence on the coast in addition to the pre-war fortress garrisons, which were expanded after hostilities. Japanese military attacks against BC amounted to a small number of parachute bombs released from great distance away and by the middle of 1942 the threat of direct attack diminished following defeat at the [[Battle of Midway]] by US forces.\n\n===Prohibition===\n[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] was prohibited in British Columbia for about four years, from 1917 to 1921. A referendum in 1916 asked BC citizens whether they approved of making alcohol illegal (the other question was whether women had the right to vote). The contested results rejecting [[prohibition]] led to a major political scandal that subsequently saw the referendum being overturned and alcohol prohibited.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/part1-24.html |title=\"Electoral History,\" Elections BC |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011154204/http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/part1-24.html |archive-date=2006-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, by 1921 the failures were so apparent&mdash;a thriving black market, arbitrary (often class- and race-based) enforcement and punishment, rampant corruption&mdash;that alcohol was established as a commodity subject to government regulation and taxation as it is today. U.S. prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s led to a thriving business of producing and smuggling alcohol to quench the thirst of BC's southern neighbors. Many of Vancouver's richest families built or consolidated their fortunes in the rum-running business. Some compare today's robust [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-growing industry in BC (the number-one cash crop) to this earlier era.<ref name=\"Haddow\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/05/marijuana-industry-canada|title=Marijuana may cause Canada's economic comedown|last=Haddow|first=Douglas|date=5 August 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===World War II contributions===\n\nA [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] was created in 1942 also, and was disbanded in 1945. During the war a range of coastal defences were constructed, including harbour defences for Vancouver. Today's [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]] sits atop the foundation for gun batteries that were used to command Vancouver Harbour approaches.\n\nMilitia units from southern BC provided cadres for many regiments that eventually fought in Europe. The [[Rocky Mountain Rangers]] sent a battalion to fight the Japanese in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands]] in 1943. Thousands more British Columbians volunteered for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Two soldiers, [[Ernest Alvia Smith]] and [[John Keefer Mahony]], were awarded the Victoria Cross for actions with BC-based regiments in Italy.\n\n===Columbia River Treaty===\nIn 1961, British Columbia ratified the [[Columbia River Treaty]] which required the building of three large dams in British Columbia in return for financial compensation related to U.S. hydroelectric power production enabled by the dams. The dams flooded large areas within British Columbia, but would prove to be a very stable and renewable source of power for the province.\n\n==21st century==\n\nIf the 20th century can be said to have been (see above) one of ethnocultural strife, the 21st thus far can be said to be one of relative harmony.

With few exceptions (the Douglas Treaties of Fort Rupert and southern Vancouver Island) no treaties were signed. Some early settlers assumed, based on the catastrophic population crash of First Nations peoples linked to smallpox, and racist ideas that 'Indians' were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the 'Indian Land Question'.\n\nUpon Confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for Indians and lands reserved for Indians, while the province had responsibility for non-Aboriginal civil matters and resources. The 1913 [[McKenna-McBride Royal Commission]] made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and First Nations rights. Several delegations to Ottawa and London were sent by First Nations seeking redress for grievances, to little avail. Instead the Indian Act, federal legislation governing First Nations, was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council. Other oppressive measures also accompanied the amendment including the [[Potlatch Ban]] and the increasingly applied [[Indian Residential School]] system designed to assimilate First Nations.\n\nThe status of the [[First Nations]] (Aboriginal) people of British Columbia is a long-standing problem that has become a major issue in recent years. First Nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base. They were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways. In many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments. Status Indians gained the right to vote in 1960. They were prohibited from possessing alcohol, which rather than preventing problems with this drug, exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinking.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Certain privileges of status Indians are governed by the [[Indian Act]]. With the exception of what are known as the [[Douglas Treaties]], negotiated by Sir James Douglas with the native people of the [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] area, no treaties were signed in British Columbia until 1998. Many native people wished to negotiate treaties, but the province refused until 1990. Another major development was the 1997 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the ''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' case that aboriginal title still exists in British Columbia.\n\n60% of First Nations in British Columbia are aligned with the First Nations Summit. This brings a total of 58 First Nations, but only 20 are said to be in active negotiations. Three Final Agreements have been settled, with one being rejected by [[Lheidli T'enneh]] in 2007. The other two, the Maa-nulth treaty group, a 5 Nuu-chah-nulth member group, and the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]]. Although these treaties have yet to be ratified by Parliament in Ottawa and Legislature in Victoria, neighbouring First Nations are seeking to block these treaties in the courts. A group of Vancouver Island and some mainland First Nations, the [[WSANEC]], [[Lekwungen]], and [[Semiahmoo First Nation|Semiahmoo]], are seeking to block to Tsawwassen First Nation treaty, claiming infringement on their rights and land titles. On the west coast of Vancouver Island, the [[Ditidaht]] First Nation is doing the same against the Maa-nulth treaty group. The only treaty signed in recent years, the [[Nisga'a Final Agreement|Nisga'a Treaty]] (1998), was negotiated outside of the current [[British Columbia Treaty Process|treaty process]]. There is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations. Among indigenous people, there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of [[Aboriginal title]] and continued [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government. Therefore, a substantial number of [[First Nations government]]s consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nA November 2007 court ruling for the [[Xeni Gwet'in First Nation]] called future participation in the process into question. The judge ruled that the [[Xeni Gwet'in]] could demonstrate [[aboriginal title]] to half of the [[Nemaia Valley]], and that the province had no power over these lands.<ref name=\"hugewin\">[http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=44bcbe05-644b-41ac-a8c2-168540b2342d Huge win for Interior natives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201193131/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=44bcbe05-644b-41ac-a8c2-168540b2342d |date=2008-12-01 }}, [[The Province]], November 22, 2007</ref> Under the BC treaty process, negotiating nations have received as little as 5% of their claimed land recognized.

Founded out of the remains of a defunct [[Packet trade|packet company]], it gradually rose up as one of the most prominent shipping lines in the world, providing passenger and cargo services between the British Empire and the United States. While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed, White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing steady and comfortable passages, for both upper class travellers and immigrants. Today, it is most famous for the innovative vessel [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and for the losses of some of their best passenger liners, including the wrecking of [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] at Halifax in 1873, the sinking of [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']] off Nantucket in 1909, the loss of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']] in 1916 while serving as a hospital ship. Despite its casualties, the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the [[Great Depression]], which ultimately led to a merger with its chief rival, [[Cunard Line]], which operated as [[Cunard-White Star Line]] until 1950. Cunard Line then operated as a separate entity until 2005 and is now part of [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. As a lasting reminder of the White Star Line, modern Cunard ships use the term ''White Star Service'' to describe the level of customer care expected of the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |title=The Legendary Cunard White Star Service |website=The Cunarders |access-date=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117120152/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |archive-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:White Star flag NEW.svg|thumb|180px|White Star Line flag]]\nThe first company bearing the name ''White Star Line'' was founded in [[Liverpool]], England, by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson in 1845. It focused on the UK\u2013Australia trade, which increased following the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in Australia. The fleet initially consisted of the chartered sailing ships [[RMS Tayleur|RMS ''Tayleur'']], ''[[Blue Jacket (clipper)|Blue Jacket]]'', ''White Star'', ''[[Red Jacket (clipper)|Red Jacket]]'', ''Ellen'', ''Ben Nevis'', ''Emma'', ''Mermaid'' and ''Iowa''. ''Tayleur'', the largest ship of its day, was wrecked on its maiden voyage to Australia at [[Lambay Island]], near Ireland, a disaster that haunted the company for years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=Edward J|title=Bound for Australia|year=2003|page=18|isbn=0-9523027-3-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, the company acquired its first steamship, ''Royal Standard''.<ref>http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/R-Ships/royalstandard1863.html</ref>\n\nThe original White Star Line merged with two other small lines in 1864, The Black Ball Line and The Eagle Line, to form a conglomerate, the [[Liverpool]], [[Melbourne]] and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/White_Star_Line|title=White Star Line|website=Gracesguide.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> This did not prosper and White Star broke away. White Star concentrated on Liverpool to [[New York City]] services. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company's bank, the [[Royal Bank of Liverpool]], failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an incredible debt of \u00a3527,000 ({{Inflation|UK|572000|1867|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and was forced into bankruptcy.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ===\nOn 18 January 1868, [[Thomas Henry Ismay|Thomas Ismay]], a director of the [[National Line]], purchased the house flag, trade name and goodwill of the bankrupt company for \u00a31,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1868|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} with the intention of operating large ships on the North Atlantic service between Liverpool and New York. Ismay established the company's headquarters at [[Albion House, Liverpool]].\n[[File:Albion House (White Star Building), Lobby, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|left|Albion House (White Star Line Building), Interior Lobby, Liverpool]]\n\nIsmay was approached by [[Gustav Christian Schwabe]], a prominent [[Liverpool]] merchant, and his nephew, the shipbuilder [[Gustav Wilhelm Wolff]], during a game of billiards.

The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any vessels for the White Star's rivals. In 1870, [[William Imrie]] joined the managing company. As the first ship was being commissioned, Ismay formed the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company to operate the steamers under construction.\n\n==The North Atlantic Run==\n===The ''Oceanic'' class===\nWhite Star began its North Atlantic run between Liverpool and New York with six nearly identical ships, also known as the 'Oceanic' class: [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'' (I)]], [[RMS Atlantic|''Atlantic'']], [[SS Baltic (1871)|''Baltic'']], and [[SS Republic (1872)|''Republic'']], followed by the slightly larger [[SS Celtic (1872)|''Celtic'']] and [[SS Adriatic (1871)|''Adriatic'']]. It had long been customary for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of their ships. White Star gave their ships names ending in ''-ic''. The line also adopted a buff-coloured funnel with a black top as a distinguishing feature for their ships, as well as a distinctive [[Maritime flags|house flag]], a red [[broad pennant]] with two tails, bearing a white five-pointed star. In the initial designs for this first fleet of liners, each ship was to measure 420 feet in length, 40 feet in width and approximately 3,707 in gross tonnage, equipped with compound expansion engines powering a single screw, and capable of speeds of up to 14 knots. They were also identical in passenger accommodations based on a two-class system, providing accommodations for 166 First Class passengers amidships, which in those days was commonly referred to as 'Saloon Class' and 1,000 Steerage passengers.\n\nIt was within the circles of the massive tides of immigrants flowing from Europe to North America that the White Star Line aimed to be revered by, as throughout the company's full history they regularly strived to provide passage for steerage passengers which greatly exceeded that seen with other shipping lines. With the 'Oceanic' class, one of the most notable developments in steerage accommodations was the division of steerage at opposite ends of the vessels, with single men being berthed forward, and single women and families berthed aft, with later developments allowing married couples berths aft as well. \n[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1871, (3,888 GRT)]]\nWhite Star's entry into the Trans-Atlantic passenger market in the spring of 1871 got off to a rocky start. When ''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 2 March, she departed Liverpool with only 64 passengers aboard, from whence she was expected to make port at Queenstown the following day to pick up more passengers before proceeding to New York. However, before she had cleared the Welsh coast her bearings overheated off Holyhead and she was forced to return for repairs. She resumed her crossing on 17 March and ended up not completing the crossing to New York until 28 March. However, upon her arrival in New York, she drew considerable attention, as by the time she departed on her return crossing to Liverpool on 15 April, some 50,000 spectators had looked her over.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 11\u201312.</ref> White Star's troubles with their first ship were short lived, as on ''Oceanic'''s second crossing to New York, on which she departed Liverpool on 11 May and arrived in New York on 23 May, she completed the crossing timely and with 407 passengers aboard.\n\nIn the eighteen months to follow, the five remaining ships were completed, and one by one, joined her on the North Atlantic run. ''Atlantic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 8 June without incident. However, later that summer another problem surfaced which posed a threat to public opinion of the line. Of the six ships, the names originally selected for third and sixth ships of the fleet had initially been selected as ''Pacific'' and ''Arctic'', which when mentioned in the press appeared alongside references two ships of the same names which had belonged to the since defunct [[Collins Line]], both of which were lost at sea with large losses of life. In the cases of those ships, both of which had been wooden hulled paddle steamers, the ''[[SS Arctic|Arctic]]'' had foundered of the coast of Newfoundland in September 1854 after colliding with another ship, resulting in the loss of over 300 lives, while the ''[[SS Pacific (1849)|Pacific]]'' vanished with 186 on board in January 1856. As a result, White Star made arrangements to change the names of these two ships. The third ship of the fleet, which had been launched as ''Pacific'' on 8 March 1871 was renamed ''Baltic'' prior to its completion, a name which she sailed under on her maiden voyage on 14 September. At that same time, the keel of the last ship in the fleet, which had been named ''Arctic'' had just been laid at Harland & Wolff, and was thus renamed ''Celtic'' prior to her launch.\n\nThe fourth vessel of the ''Oceanic'' class, ''Republic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 February 1872, around which time modifications were being made to the last two ships still under construction. Alterations in their designs called for their hulls to be extended in length by 17 feet, which for the ''Adriatic'' increased her gross tonnage to 3,888, and for ''Celtic'' her tonnage was increased to 3,867. ''Adriatic'' entered service on 11 April 1872, followed by ''Celtic'' six months later on 24 October. These ships began their careers with notable success, the most notable being ''Adriatic'', which after barely a month in service became the first White Star ship to capture the Blue Riband, having completed a record westbound crossing in 7 days, 23 hours and 17 minutes at an average speed of 14.53 knots. In January 1873, ''Baltic'' became the first of the line to capture the Blue Riband for an eastbound crossing, having completed a return trip to Liverpool in 7 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of 15.09 knots.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 20, 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe first substantial loss for the company came only four years after its founding, occurring 31 March 1873 with the sinking of the [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] and the loss of 535 lives near [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. While en route to New York from Liverpool amidst a vicious storm, the ''Atlantic'' attempted to make port at Halifax when a concern arose that the ship would run out of coal before reaching New York. However, when attempting to enter Halifax, she ran aground on the rocks and sank in shallow waters. Despite being so close to shore, a majority of the victims of the disaster drowned. The crew were blamed for serious navigational errors by the Canadian Inquiry, although a British Board of Trade investigation cleared the company of all extreme wrongdoing.<ref>Greg Cochkanoff and Bob Chaulk, ''SS Atlantic: The White Star Line's First Disaster at Sea'', (Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton, 2009) p. 99.</ref>\n\n===''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''===\n[[File:SS Britannic.jpg|thumb|SS Britannic of 1874 underway.]]\nIn the wake of the ''Atlantic'' disaster, White Star ordered two new steamers from Harland & Wolff, both of which were designed as considerably larger, two-funneled versions of the ''Oceanic'' class steamers. These two ships measured in design at 455 feet in length, 45 in width, each with a gross tonnage of roughly 5,000 tons and with engines of similar design as seen in the earlier ships, with the exception of greater horsepower, capable of driving their single screws at speeds of up to 15 knots. Also increased was passenger capacity, as designs for these ships provided for 200 Saloon passengers and 1,500 Steerage passengers. The first of the pair, which had initially been named ''Hellenic'', was launched as ''[[SS Britannic (1874)|Britannic]]'' on 3 February 1874 and commenced on her maiden voyage to New York on 25 June. Her sister, ''[[SS Germanic (1874)|Germanic]]'' was launched on 15 July of that same year, but due to a rather unsightly complication in her construction involving an experimental 'adjustable' propeller shaft which had to be removed, ''Germanic'' did not enter service until 20 May 1875. One notable development with the addition of these two ships was that with this addition, ''Oceanic'' was declared surplus and in the spring of 1875 was chartered to one of White Star's subsidiaries, the Occidental & Oriental Shipping company, under which she operated on their Trans-Pacific route between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong until her retirement in 1895.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 25\u201330.</ref> The two new steamers proved immensely popular on the North Atlantic run, and both would end up capturing the Blue Riband on two eastbound and three westbound crossings within a two-year period. The ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record first in August 1875, then captured the eastbound record in February 1876, while ''Britannic'' captured both records within less than two months of each other, beating the westbound record in November and the eastbound record in December. ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record for the last time in April 1877.<ref name=\"auto\">[[Blue Riband#List of record breakers]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n===''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''===\n\nOver the next 12 years, White Star focused their attention on other matters of business, expanding their services with the introduction of several cargo and livestock carriers on the North Atlantic as well as establishing a small but lucrative passenger and cargo service to New Zealand. By 1887, however, the ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and the four remaining ''Oceanic'' class liners had aged significantly and were now being outdone in speed and comfort by newer ships brought into service by White Star's competitors such as Cunard and Inman. In an effort to outdo their competitors, White Star began making plans to put two new liners into service which would prove to be exceptionally innovative in design for the time, ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. In order to build these new ships, Thomas Ismay made arrangements with the British Government under which in exchange for financial support from the British government, the two new ships would be designed as not only passenger liners, but also as armed merchant cruisers which could be requisitioned by the British Navy in times of war. Measuring at 565 feet in length and 57 feet in width and with a gross tonnage of just under 10,000 tons, the new liners would be nearly twice the size of ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''. Additionally, owing to the arrangement with the British Government, the ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' were the first White Star liners to be built with twin screws, powered by triple expansion engines capable of driving the ships at speeds of up to 19 knots. \n[[File:Teutonic1890-1900.jpg|thumb|''Teutonic'' of 1889, (9,984 GRT)]]\nIn all, ''[[RMS Teutonic|Teutonic]]'' and ''[[RMS Majestic (1889)|Majestic]]'' were designed to be built with accommodations for 1,490 passengers in three classes across four decks, titled 'Promenade', 'Upper', 'Saloon' and 'Main'; with 300 in First Class, 190 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. Their First Class accommodations, were located amidships on all four decks, with Second Class located abaft of first on the three uppermost decks on ''Teutonic'' and all four decks on ''Majestic'', and Third Class located at the far forward and aft ends of the vessel on the Saloon and Main decks.\n\nOne notable development associated with the introduction of these two new ships was that they were the first White Star liners to incorporate the three-class passenger system. Prior to this, White Star had made smaller attempts to enter the market for Second Class travelers on the North Atlantic by adding limited spaces for Second Class passengers on their older liners. According to De Kerbrech, spaces for Second Class were added to ''Adriatic'' in 1884, ''Celtic'' in 1887 and ''Republic'' in 1888, often occupying one or two compartments formerly occupied by Steerage berths.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 19, 22, 24.</ref>\n\nIn March 1887, the first keel plates of the ''Teutonic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, while construction on ''Majestic'' commenced the following September. Construction on the two liners progressed in roughly six-month intervals, with the Teutonic being launched in January 1889 and sailing on her maiden voyage to New York the following August; while ''Majestic'' was launched in June 1889 and entered service in April 1890.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 45, 51.</ref> Prior to her entry into service, ''Teutonic'' made a rather noteworthy appearance at the 1889 Naval Review at Spithead, which was also set to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Although due to scheduling commitments she could not take part in the actual review, she anchored briefly amidst a line of merchant ships awaiting review, complete with four guns mounted, during which time she was toured by the Prince of Wales and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser, much impressed with what he saw in ''Teutonic'', is rumored to have mentioned to others in his party \"We must have one of these!\".<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 46.</ref> They would be White Star's last speed record breakers, as both ships would capture the Blue Riband in the summer of 1891 within two weeks of each other. ''Majestic'' beat the westbound record first on 5 August 1891, arriving in New York in 5 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes after keeping an average speed of 20.1 knots. This record was beat by ''Teutonic'', which arrived in New York on 19 August and beat the previous record by 1 hour and 37 minutes, this time maintaining an average speed of 20.35 knots.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', White Star did away with some of their aging fleet to make room for the new ships. Prior to the completion of the two new ships, ''Baltic'' and ''Republic'' were both sold to the [[Holland America Line]] and respectively renamed ''Veendam'' and ''Maasdam'', after which they were put into service on the company's main Trans-Atlantic route between Rotterdam and New York. ''Veendam'' was lost at sea without loss of life after striking a submerged object in 1898, while ''Maasdam'' was again sold in 1902 to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana and renamed ''Citta di Napoli'', after which she was used as an emigrant ship for an additional eight years before being sold for scrap at Genoa in 1910.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 19.</ref> In 1893, by which time ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had established themselves on the North Atlantic run, White Star sold ''Celtic'' to the Danish [[Thingvalla Line]], who renamed her ''Amerika'' and attempted to use her for their own emigrant service from Copenhagen to New York. This, however, failed to prove profitable for the line and she was sold for scrap at Brest in 1898.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 24.</ref>\n\n===''Cymric'' and the move from speed to comfort===\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, White Star experienced an explosion of rapid growth and expansion of its services, highlighted by a dramatic shift in focus from building the fastest ships on the North Atlantic to building the most comfortable and luxurious. Their first step in this direction came in 1897 during the construction of a new ship, ''[[SS Cymric|Cymric]]''. Initially designed as an enlarged version of the livestock carrier ''[[SS Georgic (1895)|Georgic]]'', which had entered service in 1895, ''Cymric'' had been planned as a combination passenger and livestock carrier, and thus was not designed with engines necessary to qualify her for the express service maintained by ''Britannic'', ''Germanic'', ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. However, while she was under construction at Harland & Wolff, a decision was made to convert spaces aboard her designated for cattle into Third Class accommodations after it was deemed that carrying passengers and livestock aboard the same vessel would not likely prove a popular venture. Therefore, in addition to the accommodations planned for 258 First Class passengers, her designs were altered to include berthing for 1,160 Third Class passengers.<ref name=\"auto1\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 65</ref>\n\nOverall, her modest layout and design placed her with a footing directly between that of the aged but well reputable ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and that of the more modern ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. Measuring at just over 13,000 tons and with a length of 585 feet and a beam of 64 feet, she was to be the largest liner in the White Star fleet, for a time at least. Additionally, her more utilitarian appearance with a single funnel and four masts contrasted her against her four running mates considerably. Because of this design, she was considered the first of White Star's 'intermediate' liners. However, as a result of this partial transition from livestock carrier to passenger liner, ''Cymric'' came to attain several noteworthy advantages which White Star would employ on several other liners. While her passenger accommodations had been modified, the specifications of her machinery and engines were left in place. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Cymric'' was fitted with twin screws, but was instead powered by quadruple expansion engines capable of achieving a modest speed of 15 knots commonly seen in cargo and livestock carriers of that time. The major difference was that because these engines were designed for more modest speeds, they were considerably smaller and required only seven boilers, leaving more space within the hull for passenger and crew accommodations.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. 'The Big Four of the White Star Line'. pp. 9\u201310.</ref> At the same time, this also meant she consumed much less coal than steamers designed with larger engines, making her more economical. ''Cymric'' was launched at Harland & Wolff in October 1897 and entered White Star's North Atlantic service in February 1898, and in time proved a popular and profitable addition to the fleet.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|''Oceanic'' of 1899, (17,272 GRT)]]\n\n===''Oceanic'' and the death of Thomas Ismay===\n\nIn the early months of 1897, while ''Cymric'' was still under construction at Harland & Wolff, it became clear to Thomas Ismay and other line officials that a new addition to the North Atlantic fleet was needed, as compared to the fleets of many of their competitors such as Cunard and North German Lloyd, White Star was lagging behind. By this point, the only remaining ship of the original 'Oceanic' class of liners was the ''Adriatic'', and in her old age of a full quarter century, her days on the North Atlantic were now numbered. ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' were not too far behind after more than twenty years service, and with the advancements seen in shipbuilding during the 1890s ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had been eclipsed by several newer vessels, most recently North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''. In response to this lagging, Ismay and his partners at Harland & Wolff set out to design two new liners for the North Atlantic run which would, in a fashion similar to how ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had done, go down in shipbuilding history.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 81.</ref>\n\nThe new steamers, which were intended to be named ''[[RMS Oceanic (1899)|Oceanic]]'' and ''Olympic'', were designed to be both the largest and most luxurious the world had ever seen. In March 1897, the first keel plates for ''Oceanic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, but almost immediately problems arose. Because the shipbuilder had never constructed a vessel of this size, work on the ship was delayed until an overhead gantry crane could be built. Her launch on 14 January 1899 drew an immense crowd of spectators numbering more than 50,000, as the launch placed ''Oceanic'' in history as the last British Trans-Atlantic liner to be launched in the 19th century as well as the first to exceed the ''Great Eastern'' in length. In all, she measured in at 704 feet in length with a beam of 68 feet, and had a gross tonnage of 17,254, making her a full 42% larger than North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse''. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' was designed with capabilities to be converted to an armed merchant cruiser in time of war if needed, specifications for which included her to be built with a double-plated hull and turrets on her upper decks which could be quickly mounted with guns.<ref name=\"auto2\">The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 4\u20135.</ref> She was also built with triple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of achieving a respectable, if not record breaking, service speed of 19 knots. Additionally, she had a considerably larger passenger capacity of just over 1,700, providing for 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 6 September 1899, arriving in New York to much added fanfare on the morning of 13 September with 1,456 passengers aboard, many of whom were well satisfied with how the crossing had gone. Among those travelling aboard in First Class were Harland & Wolff's managing director, Lord Pirrie, and Thomas Andrews, who had designed ''Oceanic'' under Thomas Ismay's direction. At the time ''Oceanic'' made her departure from Liverpool a fireman's strike had been ensuing at the docks, which in turn meant she sailed with a boiler room crew consisting of fewer men than her specifications called for. Thus, during her maiden voyage her engines had been run and maintained an average speed of just under 19 knots. In an interview, Lord Pirrie had been asked why she hadn't broken any speed records. His reply was thus as follows: \"The only record she is built to beat is that for regular running. She is to swing back and forth across the Atlantic with the regularity of a pendulum.\"<ref>The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 7, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas Ismay was unable to enjoy the fruits of his labor, much to the dismay of his family and his colleagues. Just a few weeks after ''Oceanic'' was launched, Thomas began complaining of pains in his chest, from whence his health steadily began to decline. In fact, his health began to deteriorate so rapidly that managers with White Star and Harland & Wolff both decided to cancel plans to construct the second ship which was to serve as running mate to ''Oceanic'', ''Olympic''. The name was shelved, only to be reused 12 years later. His health improved for a brief time, allowing him to visit ''Oceanic'' upon her completion in Belfast that July. During his visit, Belfast officials awarded him with a key to the city, citing his contributions to the local economy and to British merchant shipping. Unfortunately, in late August he took a turn for the worse and he underwent two operations to alleviate his ailment, both of which proved unsuccessful, and Thomas suffered a heart attack on 14 September. He lingered in worsening agony for another ten weeks until his death on 23 November 1899 at the age of 62. In the immediate aftermath, control of the company was passed to Thomas' son Bruce, who was named chairman of the line.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==='The Big Four'===\n{{main|Big Four (White Star Line)}}\n[[File:RMS Adriatic postcard.jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1907 (24,541 GRT), the largest of the ''Big Four'']]\nEven before ''Oceanic'' had been completed, White Star had already started making plans for a considerably larger addition to their fleet. In September 1898, before his health began failing, Thomas Ismay negotiated the terms for the orders for the last passenger liner he would ever order for the line he'd built. This time around, plans were essentially the same as they had been with ''Oceanic'', only taking considerable more steps in innovation. While staying with the trend in focusing more on comfort than speed as had been set with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic'', Ismay's plans called for a new passenger liner of dimensions the world had never seen, and her chosen name was to be ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', a name taken and reused from the original ''Oceanic'' class. The initial designs for ''Celtic'' had her at 680 feet in length, a tad bit shorter than ''Oceanic'', but with a greater breadth of her predecessor at 75 feet. Additionally, while the ''Oceanic'' had set the record for length, ''Celtic'' would triumph in tonnage, weighing in at just over 20,000 tons.<ref>https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/SS_Celtic</ref>\n\nOne interesting note about this new ship was in regards to her engines. Historian Mark Chirnside made a notable comparison between the machinery installed aboard ''Cymric'' and that placed in ''Oceanic''. Because ''Cymric'' had initially been designed as a livestock carrier, she was built with smaller engines capable of modest speeds which both consumed less coal and occupied less space within the hull. As a result, there was an astonishing difference which gave ''Cymric'' a considerable advantage over ''Oceanic''. Although ''Cymric'' was overall only about two-thirds the size of ''Oceanic'' in terms of gross tonnage (12,552 to 17,274), her net tonnage, a unit of measurement used to account for space aboard a ship usable for passengers and cargo was actually greater than what was seen in the larger vessel (8,123 net tons aboard ''Cymric'' compared to only 6,996 with the ''Oceanic''). According to Chirnside, builders and designers used this as a baseline for engine designs for ''Celtic''.<ref name=\"auto3\">Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10\u201311, 13.</ref> She was to be equipped with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of considerably modest speeds of just over 16 knots. Because she was geared to set lower service speeds, her coal consumption was far less at only 260 tons per day, which compared to the 400 tons per day needed to power ''Oceanic'' made her much more economical.<ref>Gardiner, Robin. \"The History of the White Star Line\". p. 121.</ref> At the same time, owing to her broad hull, she was designed with cargo holds capable of storing up to 18,500 tons of commercial cargo, a strategic placement in her design as that cargo was to serve as ballast, keeping her steady in even the roughest seas.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAdditionally, ''Celtic'' was to be designed with far greater capacities for both passengers and cargo. Her plans called for accommodations for a staggering 2,859 passengers: 347 in First Class, 160 in Second Class, and a total of 2,352 in Third Class, the latter being largest capacity seen of any liner on the North Atlantic at the time. Passenger accommodations were spread across six decks, titled from top to bottom: Boat Deck (A Deck), Upper Promenade (B Deck), Promenade (C Deck), Saloon (D Deck), Upper (E Deck) and Lower (F Deck). First Class accommodations were located amidships on the uppermost four decks and included a lounge and smoke room on the Boat Deck, as well as a grand and spacious dining room on the Saloon Deck. Second Class accommodations were allocated to the starboard sides of the Saloon and Upper Decks. Like as seen aboard ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', and ''Oceanic'', Second Class passengers were provided with their own smoke room and library, housed within a separate deckhouse situated just aft of the main superstructure, directly beneath which on the Saloon Deck was located their dining room.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20</ref>\n\nWhat made ''Celtic'' rather exceptional for the time was her Third Class accommodations, which in addition to ample open deck space on the Promenade Deck, were located on the Saloon, Upper and Lower Decks at both the forward and aft ends of the vessel, with a vast majority being located aft. The pattern followed that as was seen on all White Star vessels on the North Atlantic, with single men berthed forward, and single women, married couples and families berthed aft. On the Saloon Deck, in addition to baths and lavatories both forward and aft, were located two large dining rooms at the far after end of the deck, situated side by side, which when meals weren't being served respectively functioned as smoke and general rooms. An additional, fairly larger dining room was located directly beneath these on the Upper Deck, while a fourth dining room was located forward where single men were to be berthed, for which this dining room was equipped with a service bar. Aside from this, the biggest change brought by the ''Celtic'' for Third Class passengers was in sleeping quarters. In these days, open berths were still fairly common on the North Atlantic, which White Star had from the start gradually shied away from. Aboard the ''Oceanic'' class liners, ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'', steerage passengers had been provided with large rooms which generally slept around 20 people, while aboard ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' the usage of two and four berth cabins had been introduced, but only for married couples and families with children, a policy which also held with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic''. ''Celtic'' broke that mold. At the forward end of the vessel, located in two compartments on the Lower Deck were accommodations of the older style of sleeping arrangements, each compartment providing for 300 single men. The remaining 1,752 berths were located aft, all of which consisted of two, four and six berth cabins.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20.</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 1899, just two months after ''Oceanic'' was launched, the first keel plates of the ''Celtic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff. Construction progressed on her rapidly, and as White Star had planned, the new fleet of liners would be constructed in overlapping succession, as in October 1900, while ''Celtic''s hull was nearing completion, construction began on the second ship, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]''. When ''Celtic'' was launched in April 1901, there was much fanfare, as she was hailed the largest ship in the world in terms of tonnage, as well as being the first to exceed the tonnage of the infamous ''Great Eastern''. She took a mere four additional months for fitting out before sailing on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 26 July of that year.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10, 15\u201320.</ref> Upon her entry into service, one of her most attractive features was her seaworthiness, as on her maiden voyage it was noted how while at sea, she was \"as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.\"<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 7</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, construction on ''Cedric'' had proceeded as planned and she was launched on 21 August 1902. Although she was of exactly the same dimensions as ''Celtic'' in length and width, she outweighed her twin by a mere 155 tons, making her now the largest ship in the world. Despite their similarities, the two had distinct differences. Aboard ''Cedric'', First Class accommodations included more private bathrooms as well as more suites consisting of interconnecting cabins provided with sitting rooms.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 33</ref> In all, she had accommodations for 2,600 passengers, with a slightly increased number of First Class passengers at 350, her Second Class capacity was increased to 250, while Third Class was scaled back to approximately 2,000. ''Cedric'' entered service later that winter, departing Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 11 February 1903.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 9</ref>\n\nThe keel of the third sister, ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' had been laid down at Harland & Wolff in June 1902, while construction on ''Cedric'' was still underway. One notable instance in her construction was once her keel was fitted in place, White Star gave orders for her length to be extended by 28 feet. This change in plans required builders to cut her keel in two, move the after end backwards and install the new addition in between. Their reasons for this addition was likely to provide more spaces for passenger accommodations, which combined added up to 2,850 passengers Although ''Baltic'' was designed with the same layout for Third Class passengers as ''Cedric'', with a capacity of 2,000, her First and Second Class capacities were significantly greater. First Class was increased to a capacity for 425 passengers, while capacity for Second Class was extended to 450 passengers, almost twice that of ''Cedric'' and three times that of ''Celtic''. Simultaneously, the added length also increased her gross tonnage to 23,884, making her now the largest ship in the world. ''Baltic'' was launched on 12 November 1903, subsequently fitted out and delivered to White Star on 23 June 1904, and sailed on her maiden voyage on 29 June.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 13\u201315.</ref>\n\nWhile the first three members of the highly regarded quartet of liners were built and put into service with little problems, the fourth and final ship, ''[[RMS Adriatic (1906)|Adriatic]]'', experienced a considerable delay in her construction. Initially, her construction had commenced in November 1902 while ''Baltic'' was still being built, but a series of delays slowed her construction to a snail's pace as compared to that of her sisters. For example, the timeline of construction on ''Baltic'' between the laying of her keel and her launch was roughly 17 months. By the time ''Adriatic'' was finally launched in September 1906, she'd been under construction for almost 46 months, more than twice the time needed to construct her twin.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 54</ref> In her design, her passenger accommodations followed the same trend as seen with ''Baltic'', with added focus on the upper two classes while still maintaining the high standard for Third Class. Her overall passenger capacity was also identical to that of ''Baltic'' at 2,850, but with differences in capacities for each class, with First Class increased to 450, Second Class increased to 500 and Third Class scaled back to 1,900. Unlike her sisters however, she was unable to attain the title of world's largest ship at the time of her completion, as her 24,451 gross tonnage was just barely outmatched by Hamburg Amerika's ''Kaiserin Auguste Victoria'', which measured at 24,581 tons and entered service four months prior to the launch of ''Adriatic''. She would, however, rank briefly as the largest British-built ship until Cunard's famous greyhound ''Lusitania'' came into service the following year.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 16\u201317.</ref> She sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 8 May 1907, and not long afterwards gained a considerable reputation for her interiors, enough for the British tabloid ''The Bystander'' to dub her 'The Liner Luxurious'. One of her most notable innovations was that she was the first liner to have an onboard Turkish Bath and swimming pool.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 61</ref>\n\n===Intermediate liners and rapid expansion, 1903\u201307===\n\nAs White Star gradually brought the 'Big Four' into service, they also attained several smaller 'intermediate' liners in preparation for a considerable expansion of their passenger services on the North Atlantic. In 1903 alone they came to obtain five new liners, beginning with ''Arabic''. Originally laid down as ''Minnewaska'' for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was transferred to White Star prior to completion and was launched under her new name on 18 December 1902. Similar in size and appearance to ''Cymric'' with a single funnel and four masts, she measured at 600 feet in length with a beam of 65 feet, weighing in at 15,801 gross tons with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of a service speed of 16 knots. She was fitted with fairly modest accommodations for 1,400 passengers: 200 in First Class, 200 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. She sailed on her maiden voyage out of Liverpool to New York on 26 June 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the IMMCo. takeover under J. Pierpont Morgan, White Star obtained four newly completed liners in the last months of 1903, they being the ''Columbus'', ''Commonwealth'', ''New England'' and ''Mayflower''. These four liners had been owned and operated by the Dominion Line for their services between Liverpool and Boston as well as their Mediterranean cruising and emigrant route, which also connected to Boston. However, the Dominion Line was also absorbed into the IMM scheme and the four ships were transferred to White Star. In addition to the acquisition of these ships, White Star also acquired control of the routes as well. Upon their acquisition by White Star, the four liners were respectively renamed ''Republic'', ''Cretic'', ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic''. These four ships were greatly similar in appearance to the ''Cymric'' and ''Arabic'', all with a single funnel with two or four masts, with engines geared to twin screws capable of service speeds between 14 and 16 knots. They all also fell within the same range in terms of dimensions, with lengths between 550 and 582 feet, beams between 59 and 67 feet, and gross tonnage as follows, ''Republic'' at 15,378 tons, ''Cretic'' 13,518 tons, ''Romanic'' at 11,394 tons and ''Canopic'' at 12,097 tons. There was, however, considerable variances in passenger capacities. ''Republic'', which in time would come to obtain the nickname 'The Millionaire's Ship', had the largest capacity with accommodations for 2,400 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 2,000 Third Class). The three remaining ships had considerably smaller capacities, with the ''Cretic'' designed with accommodations for 1,510 passengers (260 First Class, 250 Second Class, 1,000 Third Class), ''Romanic'' with accommodations for 1,200 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 800 Third Class) and ''Canopic'' with accommodations for 1,277 passengers (275 First Class, 232 Second Class, 770 Third Class).<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 113\u2013118.</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of their service under Dominion in the late fall of 1903, the four liners were briefly withdrawn from service, their names redone, funnels repainted in White Star colors, and made ready for their new services. ''Romanic'' was the first to enter service under White Star, sailing for Boston on 19 November, followed by ''Cretic'' on 26 November. In order to balance the schedule between the Liverpool and Mediterranean services to Boston, ''Cymric'' was transferred to the Liverpool-Boston route, departing Liverpool for her first trip to Boston on 10 December, while ''Republic'' entered service to Boston on 17 December. ''Canopic'' completed the service upon her departure from Liverpool on 14 January 1904. Upon their arrivals in Boston, ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic'' were both immediately transferred to the Mediterranean services formerly upheld by the Dominion Line. This route followed a line which first made port at [[Sao Miguel Island|Sao Miguel]] in the [[Azores]] before passing through the straits of Gibraltar and making port in Naples and Genoa. ''Republic'' was also put into service on the Mediterranean route following her first crossing to Boston, but only for the first half of the 1904 season, as come summer she was switched back to the Liverpool-Boston service until winter, a pattern of divided seasons between  the North Atlantic and Mediterranean routes which she would follow for the remainder of her career. ''Cretic'' remained on the Liverpool-Boston service running opposite ''Cymric'' for a full year until November 1904, when alongside ''Republic'' she began sailing on a secondary service to the Mediterranean from New York.<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\"/>\n\n[[File:Canute Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|Canute Chambers, former White Star Line offices in Southampton]]\nIn the early months of 1907, White Star began preparations for another extension of their services on the North Atlantic by establishing an 'Express' service to New York. The new service would terminate out of Southampton every Wednesday, first heading south across the English Channel to the French port of Cherbourg that evening, then sailing back across the channel to Queenstown the following morning before proceeding to New York. On eastbound crossings, ships would forego calling at Queenstown and make port at Plymouth, before proceeding to Cherbourg and Southampton. Because of its proximity to London, Southampton had a clear advantage over Liverpool in reducing travelling time, while by establishing a terminal at Cherbourg White Star had established a route which allowed travelers to embark or disembark at either a British or Continental port.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 66</ref> Another subsidiary of IMM, the [[American Line]], had moved their operations to Southampton in 1893 and established an express service via Cherbourg which had proved very successful, thus prompting White Star to make a similar move.<ref>Flayhart, William H. \"The American Line: 1871\u20131902\". p. 139.</ref> ''Celtic'' embarked on two experimental crossings from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown, first on 20 April and then again on 18 May, which proved successful and set the way for the establishment of the route, which was to be maintained by ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' and the newly completed ''Adriatic''. ''Celtic'' was returned to the Liverpool service after the second crossing, and her place taken on the new run by ''Adriatic'', which sailed from Southampton for the first time on 5 June, followed by ''Teutonic'' on 12 June, ''Oceanic'' on 19 June and ''Majestic'' on 26 June.\n\n=== Olympic class ships ===\n{{Main|Olympic-class ocean liner}}\n[[File:RMS Titanic 1.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' of 1912 (46,328 GRT)]]\nThe Cunard Line was the chief competitor to White Star. In response to Cunard's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']], White Star ordered the ''Olympic'' class liners: [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']]. While Cunard was famed for the speed of their ships, the ''Olympic'' class were to be the largest and most luxurious ships in the world. ''Olympic'', however, was the only ship of this class to have a successful career. ''Titanic'' sank on her maiden voyage in April 1912, while ''Britannic'' was requisitioned by the British government while she was still being fitted out, and was used as a [[hospital ship]] during [[World War I]]. ''Britannic'' hit an underwater mine in the Kea Channel and sank on the morning of 21 November 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britannic-sinks-in-aegean-sea|title=Britannic sinks in Aegean Sea \u2013 Nov 21, 1916 |website=History.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nLike many other shipping lines, the White Star Line suffered heavy losses during the [[First World War]] which began in August 1914, including some of their most prestigious vessels. The first major war loss was of [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1899, which was converted into an [[armed merchant cruiser]] and ran aground near the [[Shetland Islands]] due to navigational error in September 1914. The first White Star ship lost to enemy action was the liner [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in August 1915 with the loss of 44 lives.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=181\u2013183|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref>\n\n1916 would see the largest loss of the war, Titanic's sister ship [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']] which was sunk near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] in May after striking a [[naval mine]], while in service as a [[hospital ship]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest loss for the company, and also the [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|largest ship sunk]] during the conflict. 1916 also saw the loss of the liner [[SS Cymric|''Cymric'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in May, and also of the cargo ship [[SS Georgic (1895)|''Georgic'']], which was scuttled in December with its cargo of 1,200 horses still on board, after being intercepted in the Atlantic by the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|M\u00f6we|1914|6}}.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n1917 saw the loss of the liner [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] in January which struck a mine off the Irish coast and sank with the loss of 354 lives and 3,211 gold ingots. The following month the liner [[SS Afric|''Afric'']] was sunk by a torpedo in the English Channel, as was the liner [[SS Delphic (1897)|''Delphic'']] in August.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nMany White Star vessels were requisitioned for various types of war service, most commonly for use as [[troop ship]]s, the most notable of these was the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] which transported over 200,000 troops during the conflict.<ref>Chirnside, Mark (2011). The 'Olympic' Class Ships. The History Press. p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-5895-3}}.</ref><ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n=== Interwar years ===\n[[File:White Star Line Routes and Ships 1923.jpg|thumb|right|White Star Line routes and steamer fleet, 1923]]\nThe losses of the ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic'' left ''Olympic'' as the only surviving member of White Star's planned trio of express liners. In 1922 the White Star Line obtained two former German liners which had been ceded to Britain as [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ostensibly as replacements for the war losses of ''Britannic'', ''Oceanic'', ''Arabic'', ''Cymric'' and ''Laurentic''.: The former ''SS Bismarck'' which was renamed [[RMS Majestic (1914)|''Majestic'']], and the former ''SS Columbus'' which was renamed [[RMS Homeric (1913)|''Homeric'']]. At 56,551 gross tons,  ''Majestic'' was then the world's largest liner and became the company's flagship. The two former German liners operated successfully alongside ''Olympic'' for an express service on the Southampton\u2013New York route until the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand after 1930.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn the immediate post-war period there was a boom in the transatlantic emigrant trade, from which White Star was able to benefit for a time, however this trade was badly affected by the American [[Immigration Act of 1924]] which introduced quotas for immigrants to the United States. This hit the profits of the shipping lines, for whom the emigrant trade had been a staple for nearly a century. However the growth in [[tourism]] was to some degree able to offset the decline of the emigrant trade, and White Star made efforts to appeal to this new breed of traveller by gradually overhauling liners still in service and re-configuring Third Class accommodations as Tourist Class.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn 1927 the White Star Line was purchased by the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] (RMSPC), making RMSPC the largest shipping group in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsoll.org/OnTheLine/ShippingLines/royalmail/default.asp#2 |title=Fact file \u2013 PortCities Southampton |website=Plimsoll.org |date= |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: The Kylsant years |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208010107/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 a new [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic (III)]] was proposed and her keel was laid down that year at Harland and Wolff. The thousand foot long liner was to have been a [[motor ship]] propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system, but the ship was never completed due to financial issues. ''Oceanic'''s keel was dismantled and the steel was used in two new smaller motor ships: [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'' (III)]] and [[MV Georgic (1932)|''Georgic'' (II)]]. Both of these ships entered service by 1932; they were the last liners White Star had built.\n\nRMSPC ran into financial trouble, and was liquidated in 1932. A new company, Royal Mail Lines Limited, took over the ships of RMSPC and their subordinate lines including White Star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: Royal Mail Lines, Ltd |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083323/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Georgic postcard.jpg|thumb|[[MV Georgic (1932)|MV ''Georgic'']]; the last ship to be built for the White Star Line before the merger.]]\n\n=== Cunard merger ===\n[[File:Cunard White Star Line Logo.JPG|thumbpx|thumbnail|left|''Cunard-White Star'' Logo]]\nIn 1933 White Star and Cunard were both in serious financial difficulties because of the [[Great Depression]], falling passenger numbers and the advanced age of their fleets. Work was halted on Cunard's new giant, Hull 534 (later the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]) in 1931 to save money. In 1933 the British government agreed to provide assistance to the two competitors on the condition that they merge their North Atlantic operations. The agreement was completed on 30 December 1933.\n\nThe merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating [[Cunard-White Star Limited]]. White Star contributed ten ships to the new company while Cunard contributed 15 ships. Because of this, and since Hull 534 was Cunard's ship, 62% of the company was owned by Cunard's shareholders and 38% of the company was owned for the benefit of White Star's creditors. White Star's Australia and New Zealand services were not involved in the merger, but were separately disposed of to Shaw, Savill & Albion later in 1934. A year after this merger, [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], the last of her class, was removed from service. She was scrapped in 1937.\n\nIn 1947 Cunard acquired the 38% of Cunard White Star they did not already own, and on 31 December 1949 they acquired Cunard-White Star's assets and operations, and reverted to using the name \"Cunard\" on 1 January 1950. From the time of the 1934 merger, the house flags of both lines had been flown on all their ships, with each ship flying the flag of its original owner above the other, but from 1950, even [[MV Georgic (1931)|''Georgic'']]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/georgic/ |title=Georgic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010 }}</ref> and [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'']],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/britannic/ |title=Britannic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> the last surviving White Star liners, flew the Cunard house flag above the White Star burgee until they were each withdrawn from service, in 1956 and 1961 respectively.

However, in the late 1890s White Star decided to reinstate a service to Australia, partly because of the discovery of further gold deposits in [[Western Australia]] leading to another series of gold rushes and an increased traffic in emigrants to Australia, while there was also an increasing trade in minerals, agricultural produce, wool and meat in the other direction. The latter had become a major source of revenue for shipping lines already on the route after the advent of effective mechanical [[refrigeration]] systems in the late 1880s, allowing large quantities of cattle carcasses to be preserved on the long voyage back to the [[British Isles]].\n\nThomas Ismay decided to re-enter the Australian run in 1897 with a monthly service between [[Liverpool]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Sydney]]. A stop at [[Tenerife]] was included in the schedule both outbound and inbound. Outbound ships would call at [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] and the return trip would call at [[Plymouth]] before ending at Liverpool. With that route taking six weeks, five ships would be needed to maintain the service in both directions. The specification for the new ships was drawn up and the order placed with Harland & Wolff in the summer of 1897, coinciding with the [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], thus they became known as the [[Jubilee-class ocean liner]]s.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=78\u201389|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> In keeping with White Star's new philosophy on the Atlantic of size over speed, the Jubilee-class were to be the largest ships ever put on the Australia run, at 550&nbsp;ft (168 metres) in length and nearly 12,000 gross tons. They were single-funnel, twin-screw ships designed as mixed cargo/passenger vessels, being in essence enlarged versions of White Star's [[SS Naronic|Naronic-class]] ships.<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=50\u201354}}</ref> With a service speed of 14 knots the Jubilee-class were significantly slower than the smaller mailships run by the [[Orient Line]] and [[P&O (company)|P&O]]. Their size meant they could not transit the [[Suez Canal]] and would have to take the long route via South Africa so would not attract first-class passengers. Instead they were intended for the emigrant/seasonal worker traffic, carrying 320 passengers solely in what was described as third-class accommodation. However, following White Star's long tradition of improving standards for third-class passengers, these facilities were considerably ahead of the equivalent on other lines, being broadly in line with second-class facilities on other ships. Although all of the same class, prices for berths on the Jubilee-class varied, allowing passengers the choice of two- or four-berth cabins for a premium or open dormitories. Passengers had use of facilities such as a large dining room, a library and a smoking room, as well as free run of nearly all the ship's deck space during the voyage. The ships could carry 15,000 tons of cargo in seven holds, including capacity for 100,000 meat carcasses.<ref name=\"NQR\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81645587 |title=A Mammoth Steamship.

The final pair of ships for the Australia run were to a modified design following the experiences with the original trio. The Australia Run proved to be more popular with passengers than expected so these two ships, [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] and [[SS Suevic|''Suevic'']] had their bridges moved forward and their poop decks extended.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/><ref name=\"Haws\"/> As well as slightly increasing their gross tonnage this gave them capacity for a further 50 passengers, bringing the total to 400. ''Suevic'' made her maiden voyage in May 1901, bringing White Star's new Australian service to full strength. By now the return voyage also included a stop at [[London]] \u2013 most passengers from Australia disembarked at Plymouth, to go to their final destination by railway, while much of the cargo was bound for London. The ship would then steam back through the [[English Channel]] to offload the last of her cargo and passengers at Liverpool before preparing for the next voyage. \n[[File:PERSIC_on_left_and_CERAMIC_on_right,_both_of_the_White_Star_Line._(3307507923).jpg|thumb|''Persic'' (left) and ''Ceramic'' (right) loading at [[Sydney]] in the 1920s.]]\nThe Australian Run was successful and profitable for White Star, and largely uneventful for the ships. In the earliest days of the route the initial three ships were heavily used to transport men, soldiers and supplies to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], while ''Suevic'' [[SS Suevic#Shipwreck|ran aground]] off [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] in dramatic fashion in 1907, but there were no casualties and, despite the ship being broken in two, she was repaired and reentered service in January 1908.<ref name=\"Haws\"/> The success of the new Australian service in terms of freight led to White Star transferring an older cargo-only ship of a similar size to the Jubilee-class, the [[SS Cevic (1893)|''Cevic'']], from the New York service to the Australia Run. In 1910 ''Cevic'' was used to experiment with routing ships to Australia via the [[Suez Canal]] but she ran aground several times in the canal and the ships remained on the route via the Cape. ''Cevic'' was used on the Australia Run on a seasonale basis, mainly carrying cattle and wool at the end of the Australian autumn (February\u2013April) and then being switched to the New York Run during the Atlantic summer.\n\nContinued demand for extra passenger capacity led to White Star building a one-off ship for the route. Launched in 1913, [[SS Ceramic|''Ceramic'']] was a larger, more sophisticated development of the Jubilee-class, at 655 feet (200 metres) in length and 18,495 gross tons. Like the [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] and the [[Olympic-class ocean liner|Olympic-class]], ''Ceramic'' was a triple-screw ship with the central propeller driven by a low-pressure turbine using exhaust from the two recriprocating steam engines. This enabled her to be slightly faster \u2013 16 knots \u2013 than the Jubilee-class vessels despite her extra size for a minimal increase in coal consumption. The new ship had a significantly larger superstructure and nearly double the passenger capacity of the Jubilee-class ships \u2013 a total of 600 passengers, still carried only in what was advertised as third-class accommodation. She could also carry 19,000 tons cargo in eight holds, including 321,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space.<ref name=\"Hardy\">{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Clare|title=SS Ceramic, The Untold Story|date=2006|pages=19\u201320|ISBN=1 904908 64 0}}</ref> The dimensions of ''Ceramic'' were restricted by the length of the quay at London's [[Port of Tilbury]] and the clearance for the masts under the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. When she arrived in Sydney in September 1914 she took the place of the Jubilee-class ships as the largest vessels put on the Australia Run from Britain and became the tallest ship to pass under the bridge.<ref name=\"Hardy\"/>\n\nAll seven ships were requisitioned as troop transports during the [[World War I]], forcing White Star to suspend the regular Australia service. ''Afric'' was torpedoed by a [[U-Boat]] in the English Channel in 1917 and ''Cevic'' remained in the ownership of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] after the war but the other five ships were returned to White Star and the service was resumed in 1919. The remaining Jubilee-class liners were withdrawn from White Star service in the late 1920s. ''Persic'' was scrapped in 1926 while the other three were sold in 1928 (''Medic'' and ''Suevic'') and 1929 (''Runic''). All were converted into whaling [[factory ship]]s on account of their size and cargo capacity. The Australia Run was no longer so lucrative or as heavily-trafficked as it had been before the war and the route was no longer a priority for White Star, especially once it came under the ownership of the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] in 1927. A new ship, intended to be the first of a new class to replace the Jubilee-class, had been launched in 1917 - the [[SS Vedic|''Vedic'']]. This was the first White Star Line ship to be powered solely by [[steam turbine|turbines]] and had the same emigrant/cargo-carrying role as her predecessors, although at 460 feet (140 metres) and 9,332 gross tons she was smaller than the older ships. ''Vedic'' went straight from the builders to service as a troopship and was initially used on White Star's Canadian service until she was put on the Australia Run in 1925. Between them ''Ceramic'' and ''Vedic'' maintained a less-intensive Australian service until their owners merged with the [[Cunard Line]]. The new management immediately decided to end White Star's routes to the southern hemisphere \u2013 ''Ceramic'' was sold to [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]], which continued to operate her on the same route, while ''Vedic'' was scrapped.\n\n== White Star Line today ==\n\n[[File:SS Nomadic March 2012.jpg|thumb|Last surviving White Star ship, [[SS Nomadic (1911)|SS ''Nomadic'']], as she appeared in 2012, drydocked in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland]]\n\nThe White Star Line's Head Offices still exist in Liverpool, standing in James Street within sight of the more grandiose headquarters of their rivals, the Cunard Building.

Founded out of the remains of a defunct [[Packet trade|packet company]], it gradually rose up as one of the most prominent shipping lines in the world, providing passenger and cargo services between the British Empire and the United States. While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed, White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing steady and comfortable passages, for both upper class travellers and immigrants. Today, it is most famous for the innovative vessel [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and for the losses of some of their best passenger liners, including the wrecking of [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] at Halifax in 1873, the sinking of [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']] off Nantucket in 1909, the loss of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']] in 1916 while serving as a hospital ship. Despite its casualties, the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the [[Great Depression]], which ultimately led to a merger with its chief rival, [[Cunard Line]], which operated as [[Cunard-White Star Line]] until 1950. Cunard Line then operated as a separate entity until 2005 and is now part of [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. As a lasting reminder of the White Star Line, modern Cunard ships use the term ''White Star Service'' to describe the level of customer care expected of the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |title=The Legendary Cunard White Star Service |website=The Cunarders |access-date=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117120152/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/cunard%20white%20star%20service.html |archive-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:White Star flag NEW.svg|thumb|180px|White Star Line flag]]\nThe first company bearing the name ''White Star Line'' was founded in [[Liverpool]], England, by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson in 1845. It focused on the UK\u2013Australia trade, which increased following the [[Australian gold rushes|discovery of gold]] in Australia. The fleet initially consisted of the chartered sailing ships [[RMS Tayleur|RMS ''Tayleur'']], ''[[Blue Jacket (clipper)|Blue Jacket]]'', ''White Star'', ''[[Red Jacket (clipper)|Red Jacket]]'', ''Ellen'', ''Ben Nevis'', ''Emma'', ''Mermaid'' and ''Iowa''. ''Tayleur'', the largest ship of its day, was wrecked on its maiden voyage to Australia at [[Lambay Island]], near Ireland, a disaster that haunted the company for years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=Edward J|title=Bound for Australia|year=2003|page=18|isbn=0-9523027-3-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, the company acquired its first steamship, ''Royal Standard''.<ref>http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/R-Ships/royalstandard1863.html</ref>\n\nThe original White Star Line merged with two other small lines in 1864, The Black Ball Line and The Eagle Line, to form a conglomerate, the [[Liverpool]], [[Melbourne]] and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/White_Star_Line|title=White Star Line|website=Gracesguide.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> This did not prosper and White Star broke away. White Star concentrated on Liverpool to [[New York City]] services. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company's bank, the [[Royal Bank of Liverpool]], failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an incredible debt of \u00a3527,000 ({{Inflation|UK|572000|1867|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and was forced into bankruptcy.<ref name=\"gracesguide.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ===\nOn 18 January 1868, [[Thomas Henry Ismay|Thomas Ismay]], a director of the [[National Line]], purchased the house flag, trade name and goodwill of the bankrupt company for \u00a31,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1868|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} with the intention of operating large ships on the North Atlantic service between Liverpool and New York.

The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any vessels for the White Star's rivals. In 1870, [[William Imrie]] joined the managing company. As the first ship was being commissioned, Ismay formed the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company to operate the steamers under construction.\n\n==The North Atlantic Run==\n===The ''Oceanic'' class===\nWhite Star began its North Atlantic run between Liverpool and New York with six nearly identical ships, also known as the 'Oceanic' class: [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'' (I)]], [[RMS Atlantic|''Atlantic'']], [[SS Baltic (1871)|''Baltic'']], and [[SS Republic (1872)|''Republic'']], followed by the slightly larger [[SS Celtic (1872)|''Celtic'']] and [[SS Adriatic (1871)|''Adriatic'']]. It had long been customary for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of their ships. White Star gave their ships names ending in ''-ic''. The line also adopted a buff-coloured funnel with a black top as a distinguishing feature for their ships, as well as a distinctive [[Maritime flags|house flag]], a red [[broad pennant]] with two tails, bearing a white five-pointed star. In the initial designs for this first fleet of liners, each ship was to measure 420 feet in length, 40 feet in width and approximately 3,707 in gross tonnage, equipped with compound expansion engines powering a single screw, and capable of speeds of up to 14 knots. They were also identical in passenger accommodations based on a two-class system, providing accommodations for 166 First Class passengers amidships, which in those days was commonly referred to as 'Saloon Class' and 1,000 Steerage passengers.\n\nIt was within the circles of the massive tides of immigrants flowing from Europe to North America that the White Star Line aimed to be revered by, as throughout the company's full history they regularly strived to provide passage for steerage passengers which greatly exceeded that seen with other shipping lines. With the 'Oceanic' class, one of the most notable developments in steerage accommodations was the division of steerage at opposite ends of the vessels, with single men being berthed forward, and single women and families berthed aft, with later developments allowing married couples berths aft as well. \n[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1871, (3,888 GRT)]]\nWhite Star's entry into the Trans-Atlantic passenger market in the spring of 1871 got off to a rocky start. When ''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 2 March, she departed Liverpool with only 64 passengers aboard, from whence she was expected to make port at Queenstown the following day to pick up more passengers before proceeding to New York. However, before she had cleared the Welsh coast her bearings overheated off Holyhead and she was forced to return for repairs. She resumed her crossing on 17 March and ended up not completing the crossing to New York until 28 March. However, upon her arrival in New York, she drew considerable attention, as by the time she departed on her return crossing to Liverpool on 15 April, some 50,000 spectators had looked her over.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 11\u201312.</ref> White Star's troubles with their first ship were short lived, as on ''Oceanic'''s second crossing to New York, on which she departed Liverpool on 11 May and arrived in New York on 23 May, she completed the crossing timely and with 407 passengers aboard.\n\nIn the eighteen months to follow, the five remaining ships were completed, and one by one, joined her on the North Atlantic run. ''Atlantic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 8 June without incident. However, later that summer another problem surfaced which posed a threat to public opinion of the line. Of the six ships, the names originally selected for third and sixth ships of the fleet had initially been selected as ''Pacific'' and ''Arctic'', which when mentioned in the press appeared alongside references two ships of the same names which had belonged to the since defunct [[Collins Line]], both of which were lost at sea with large losses of life. In the cases of those ships, both of which had been wooden hulled paddle steamers, the ''[[SS Arctic|Arctic]]'' had foundered of the coast of Newfoundland in September 1854 after colliding with another ship, resulting in the loss of over 300 lives, while the ''[[SS Pacific (1849)|Pacific]]'' vanished with 186 on board in January 1856. As a result, White Star made arrangements to change the names of these two ships. The third ship of the fleet, which had been launched as ''Pacific'' on 8 March 1871 was renamed ''Baltic'' prior to its completion, a name which she sailed under on her maiden voyage on 14 September. At that same time, the keel of the last ship in the fleet, which had been named ''Arctic'' had just been laid at Harland & Wolff, and was thus renamed ''Celtic'' prior to her launch.\n\nThe fourth vessel of the ''Oceanic'' class, ''Republic'' sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 February 1872, around which time modifications were being made to the last two ships still under construction. Alterations in their designs called for their hulls to be extended in length by 17 feet, which for the ''Adriatic'' increased her gross tonnage to 3,888, and for ''Celtic'' her tonnage was increased to 3,867. ''Adriatic'' entered service on 11 April 1872, followed by ''Celtic'' six months later on 24 October. These ships began their careers with notable success, the most notable being ''Adriatic'', which after barely a month in service became the first White Star ship to capture the Blue Riband, having completed a record westbound crossing in 7 days, 23 hours and 17 minutes at an average speed of 14.53 knots. In January 1873, ''Baltic'' became the first of the line to capture the Blue Riband for an eastbound crossing, having completed a return trip to Liverpool in 7 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of 15.09 knots.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 20, 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe first substantial loss for the company came only four years after its founding, occurring 31 March 1873 with the sinking of the [[RMS Atlantic|RMS ''Atlantic'']] and the loss of 535 lives near [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. While en route to New York from Liverpool amidst a vicious storm, the ''Atlantic'' attempted to make port at Halifax when a concern arose that the ship would run out of coal before reaching New York. However, when attempting to enter Halifax, she ran aground on the rocks and sank in shallow waters. Despite being so close to shore, a majority of the victims of the disaster drowned. The crew were blamed for serious navigational errors by the Canadian Inquiry, although a British Board of Trade investigation cleared the company of all extreme wrongdoing.<ref>Greg Cochkanoff and Bob Chaulk, ''SS Atlantic: The White Star Line's First Disaster at Sea'', (Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton, 2009) p. 99.</ref>\n\n===''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''===\n[[File:SS Britannic.jpg|thumb|SS Britannic of 1874 underway.]]\nIn the wake of the ''Atlantic'' disaster, White Star ordered two new steamers from Harland & Wolff, both of which were designed as considerably larger, two-funneled versions of the ''Oceanic'' class steamers. These two ships measured in design at 455 feet in length, 45 in width, each with a gross tonnage of roughly 5,000 tons and with engines of similar design as seen in the earlier ships, with the exception of greater horsepower, capable of driving their single screws at speeds of up to 15 knots. Also increased was passenger capacity, as designs for these ships provided for 200 Saloon passengers and 1,500 Steerage passengers. The first of the pair, which had initially been named ''Hellenic'', was launched as ''[[SS Britannic (1874)|Britannic]]'' on 3 February 1874 and commenced on her maiden voyage to New York on 25 June. Her sister, ''[[SS Germanic (1874)|Germanic]]'' was launched on 15 July of that same year, but due to a rather unsightly complication in her construction involving an experimental 'adjustable' propeller shaft which had to be removed, ''Germanic'' did not enter service until 20 May 1875. One notable development with the addition of these two ships was that with this addition, ''Oceanic'' was declared surplus and in the spring of 1875 was chartered to one of White Star's subsidiaries, the Occidental & Oriental Shipping company, under which she operated on their Trans-Pacific route between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong until her retirement in 1895.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 25\u201330.</ref> The two new steamers proved immensely popular on the North Atlantic run, and both would end up capturing the Blue Riband on two eastbound and three westbound crossings within a two-year period. The ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record first in August 1875, then captured the eastbound record in February 1876, while ''Britannic'' captured both records within less than two months of each other, beating the westbound record in November and the eastbound record in December. ''Germanic'' captured the westbound record for the last time in April 1877.<ref name=\"auto\">[[Blue Riband#List of record breakers]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n===''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''===\n\nOver the next 12 years, White Star focused their attention on other matters of business, expanding their services with the introduction of several cargo and livestock carriers on the North Atlantic as well as establishing a small but lucrative passenger and cargo service to New Zealand. By 1887, however, the ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and the four remaining ''Oceanic'' class liners had aged significantly and were now being outdone in speed and comfort by newer ships brought into service by White Star's competitors such as Cunard and Inman. In an effort to outdo their competitors, White Star began making plans to put two new liners into service which would prove to be exceptionally innovative in design for the time, ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. In order to build these new ships, Thomas Ismay made arrangements with the British Government under which in exchange for financial support from the British government, the two new ships would be designed as not only passenger liners, but also as armed merchant cruisers which could be requisitioned by the British Navy in times of war. Measuring at 565 feet in length and 57 feet in width and with a gross tonnage of just under 10,000 tons, the new liners would be nearly twice the size of ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic''. Additionally, owing to the arrangement with the British Government, the ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' were the first White Star liners to be built with twin screws, powered by triple expansion engines capable of driving the ships at speeds of up to 19 knots. \n[[File:Teutonic1890-1900.jpg|thumb|''Teutonic'' of 1889, (9,984 GRT)]]\nIn all, ''[[RMS Teutonic|Teutonic]]'' and ''[[RMS Majestic (1889)|Majestic]]'' were designed to be built with accommodations for 1,490 passengers in three classes across four decks, titled 'Promenade', 'Upper', 'Saloon' and 'Main'; with 300 in First Class, 190 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. Their First Class accommodations, were located amidships on all four decks, with Second Class located abaft of first on the three uppermost decks on ''Teutonic'' and all four decks on ''Majestic'', and Third Class located at the far forward and aft ends of the vessel on the Saloon and Main decks.\n\nOne notable development associated with the introduction of these two new ships was that they were the first White Star liners to incorporate the three-class passenger system. Prior to this, White Star had made smaller attempts to enter the market for Second Class travelers on the North Atlantic by adding limited spaces for Second Class passengers on their older liners. According to De Kerbrech, spaces for Second Class were added to ''Adriatic'' in 1884, ''Celtic'' in 1887 and ''Republic'' in 1888, often occupying one or two compartments formerly occupied by Steerage berths.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 19, 22, 24.</ref>\n\nIn March 1887, the first keel plates of the ''Teutonic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, while construction on ''Majestic'' commenced the following September. Construction on the two liners progressed in roughly six-month intervals, with the Teutonic being launched in January 1889 and sailing on her maiden voyage to New York the following August; while ''Majestic'' was launched in June 1889 and entered service in April 1890.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 45, 51.</ref> Prior to her entry into service, ''Teutonic'' made a rather noteworthy appearance at the 1889 Naval Review at Spithead, which was also set to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Although due to scheduling commitments she could not take part in the actual review, she anchored briefly amidst a line of merchant ships awaiting review, complete with four guns mounted, during which time she was toured by the Prince of Wales and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser, much impressed with what he saw in ''Teutonic'', is rumored to have mentioned to others in his party \"We must have one of these!\".<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 46.</ref> They would be White Star's last speed record breakers, as both ships would capture the Blue Riband in the summer of 1891 within two weeks of each other. ''Majestic'' beat the westbound record first on 5 August 1891, arriving in New York in 5 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes after keeping an average speed of 20.1 knots. This record was beat by ''Teutonic'', which arrived in New York on 19 August and beat the previous record by 1 hour and 37 minutes, this time maintaining an average speed of 20.35 knots.<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', White Star did away with some of their aging fleet to make room for the new ships. Prior to the completion of the two new ships, ''Baltic'' and ''Republic'' were both sold to the [[Holland America Line]] and respectively renamed ''Veendam'' and ''Maasdam'', after which they were put into service on the company's main Trans-Atlantic route between Rotterdam and New York. ''Veendam'' was lost at sea without loss of life after striking a submerged object in 1898, while ''Maasdam'' was again sold in 1902 to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana and renamed ''Citta di Napoli'', after which she was used as an emigrant ship for an additional eight years before being sold for scrap at Genoa in 1910.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 17, 19.</ref> In 1893, by which time ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had established themselves on the North Atlantic run, White Star sold ''Celtic'' to the Danish [[Thingvalla Line]], who renamed her ''Amerika'' and attempted to use her for their own emigrant service from Copenhagen to New York. This, however, failed to prove profitable for the line and she was sold for scrap at Brest in 1898.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 24.</ref>\n\n===''Cymric'' and the move from speed to comfort===\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, White Star experienced an explosion of rapid growth and expansion of its services, highlighted by a dramatic shift in focus from building the fastest ships on the North Atlantic to building the most comfortable and luxurious. Their first step in this direction came in 1897 during the construction of a new ship, ''[[SS Cymric|Cymric]]''. Initially designed as an enlarged version of the livestock carrier ''[[SS Georgic (1895)|Georgic]]'', which had entered service in 1895, ''Cymric'' had been planned as a combination passenger and livestock carrier, and thus was not designed with engines necessary to qualify her for the express service maintained by ''Britannic'', ''Germanic'', ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. However, while she was under construction at Harland & Wolff, a decision was made to convert spaces aboard her designated for cattle into Third Class accommodations after it was deemed that carrying passengers and livestock aboard the same vessel would not likely prove a popular venture. Therefore, in addition to the accommodations planned for 258 First Class passengers, her designs were altered to include berthing for 1,160 Third Class passengers.<ref name=\"auto1\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 65</ref>\n\nOverall, her modest layout and design placed her with a footing directly between that of the aged but well reputable ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' and that of the more modern ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic''. Measuring at just over 13,000 tons and with a length of 585 feet and a beam of 64 feet, she was to be the largest liner in the White Star fleet, for a time at least. Additionally, her more utilitarian appearance with a single funnel and four masts contrasted her against her four running mates considerably. Because of this design, she was considered the first of White Star's 'intermediate' liners. However, as a result of this partial transition from livestock carrier to passenger liner, ''Cymric'' came to attain several noteworthy advantages which White Star would employ on several other liners. While her passenger accommodations had been modified, the specifications of her machinery and engines were left in place. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Cymric'' was fitted with twin screws, but was instead powered by quadruple expansion engines capable of achieving a modest speed of 15 knots commonly seen in cargo and livestock carriers of that time. The major difference was that because these engines were designed for more modest speeds, they were considerably smaller and required only seven boilers, leaving more space within the hull for passenger and crew accommodations.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. 'The Big Four of the White Star Line'. pp. 9\u201310.</ref> At the same time, this also meant she consumed much less coal than steamers designed with larger engines, making her more economical. ''Cymric'' was launched at Harland & Wolff in October 1897 and entered White Star's North Atlantic service in February 1898, and in time proved a popular and profitable addition to the fleet.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|''Oceanic'' of 1899, (17,272 GRT)]]\n\n===''Oceanic'' and the death of Thomas Ismay===\n\nIn the early months of 1897, while ''Cymric'' was still under construction at Harland & Wolff, it became clear to Thomas Ismay and other line officials that a new addition to the North Atlantic fleet was needed, as compared to the fleets of many of their competitors such as Cunard and North German Lloyd, White Star was lagging behind. By this point, the only remaining ship of the original 'Oceanic' class of liners was the ''Adriatic'', and in her old age of a full quarter century, her days on the North Atlantic were now numbered. ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'' were not too far behind after more than twenty years service, and with the advancements seen in shipbuilding during the 1890s ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had been eclipsed by several newer vessels, most recently North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''. In response to this lagging, Ismay and his partners at Harland & Wolff set out to design two new liners for the North Atlantic run which would, in a fashion similar to how ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' had done, go down in shipbuilding history.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". p. 81.</ref>\n\nThe new steamers, which were intended to be named ''[[RMS Oceanic (1899)|Oceanic]]'' and ''Olympic'', were designed to be both the largest and most luxurious the world had ever seen. In March 1897, the first keel plates for ''Oceanic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff, but almost immediately problems arose. Because the shipbuilder had never constructed a vessel of this size, work on the ship was delayed until an overhead gantry crane could be built. Her launch on 14 January 1899 drew an immense crowd of spectators numbering more than 50,000, as the launch placed ''Oceanic'' in history as the last British Trans-Atlantic liner to be launched in the 19th century as well as the first to exceed the ''Great Eastern'' in length. In all, she measured in at 704 feet in length with a beam of 68 feet, and had a gross tonnage of 17,254, making her a full 42% larger than North German Lloyd's ''Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse''. Like ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' was designed with capabilities to be converted to an armed merchant cruiser in time of war if needed, specifications for which included her to be built with a double-plated hull and turrets on her upper decks which could be quickly mounted with guns.<ref name=\"auto2\">The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 4\u20135.</ref> She was also built with triple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of achieving a respectable, if not record breaking, service speed of 19 knots. Additionally, she had a considerably larger passenger capacity of just over 1,700, providing for 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n''Oceanic'' sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 6 September 1899, arriving in New York to much added fanfare on the morning of 13 September with 1,456 passengers aboard, many of whom were well satisfied with how the crossing had gone. Among those travelling aboard in First Class were Harland & Wolff's managing director, Lord Pirrie, and Thomas Andrews, who had designed ''Oceanic'' under Thomas Ismay's direction. At the time ''Oceanic'' made her departure from Liverpool a fireman's strike had been ensuing at the docks, which in turn meant she sailed with a boiler room crew consisting of fewer men than her specifications called for. Thus, during her maiden voyage her engines had been run and maintained an average speed of just under 19 knots. In an interview, Lord Pirrie had been asked why she hadn't broken any speed records. His reply was thus as follows: \"The only record she is built to beat is that for regular running. She is to swing back and forth across the Atlantic with the regularity of a pendulum.\"<ref>The Titanic Commutator: Vol II, Issue 23, Fall 1979: pp. 7, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas Ismay was unable to enjoy the fruits of his labor, much to the dismay of his family and his colleagues. Just a few weeks after ''Oceanic'' was launched, Thomas began complaining of pains in his chest, from whence his health steadily began to decline. In fact, his health began to deteriorate so rapidly that managers with White Star and Harland & Wolff both decided to cancel plans to construct the second ship which was to serve as running mate to ''Oceanic'', ''Olympic''. The name was shelved, only to be reused 12 years later. His health improved for a brief time, allowing him to visit ''Oceanic'' upon her completion in Belfast that July. During his visit, Belfast officials awarded him with a key to the city, citing his contributions to the local economy and to British merchant shipping. Unfortunately, in late August he took a turn for the worse and he underwent two operations to alleviate his ailment, both of which proved unsuccessful, and Thomas suffered a heart attack on 14 September. He lingered in worsening agony for another ten weeks until his death on 23 November 1899 at the age of 62. In the immediate aftermath, control of the company was passed to Thomas' son Bruce, who was named chairman of the line.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==='The Big Four'===\n{{main|Big Four (White Star Line)}}\n[[File:RMS Adriatic postcard.jpg|thumb|''Adriatic'' of 1907 (24,541 GRT), the largest of the ''Big Four'']]\nEven before ''Oceanic'' had been completed, White Star had already started making plans for a considerably large addition to their fleet. In September 1898, before his health began failing, Thomas Ismay negotiated the terms for the orders for the last passenger liner he would ever order for the line he'd built. This time around, plans were essentially the same as they had been with ''Oceanic'', only taking considerable more steps in innovation. While staying with the trend in focusing more on comfort than speed as had been set with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic'', Ismay's plans called for a new passenger liner of dimensions the world had never seen, and her chosen name was to be ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', a name taken and reused from the original ''Oceanic'' class. The initial designs for ''Celtic'' had her at 680 feet in length, a tad bit shorter than ''Oceanic'', but with a greater breadth of her predecessor at 75 feet. Additionally, while the ''Oceanic'' had set the record for length, ''Celtic'' would triumph in tonnage, weighing in at just over 20,000 tons.<ref>https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/SS_Celtic</ref>\n\nOne interesting note about this new ship was in regards to her engines. Historian Mark Chirnside made a notable comparison between the machinery installed aboard ''Cymric'' and that placed in ''Oceanic''. Because ''Cymric'' had initially been designed as a livestock carrier, she was built with smaller engines capable of modest speeds which both consumed less coal and occupied less space within the hull. As a result, there was an astonishing difference which gave ''Cymric'' a considerable advantage over ''Oceanic''. Although ''Cymric'' was overall only about two-thirds the size of ''Oceanic'' in terms of gross tonnage (12,552 to 17,274), her net tonnage, a unit of measurement used to account for space aboard a ship usable for passengers and cargo was actually greater than what was seen in the larger vessel (8,123 net tons aboard ''Cymric'' compared to only 6,996 with the ''Oceanic''). According to Chirnside, builders and designers used this as a baseline for engine designs for ''Celtic''.<ref name=\"auto3\">Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10\u201311, 13.</ref> She was to be equipped with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of considerably modest speeds of just over 16 knots. Because she was geared to set lower service speeds, her coal consumption was far less at only 260 tons per day, which compared to the 400 tons per day needed to power ''Oceanic'' made her much more economical.<ref>Gardiner, Robin. \"The History of the White Star Line\". p. 121.</ref> At the same time, owing to her broad hull, she was designed with cargo holds capable of storing up to 18,500 tons of commercial cargo, a strategic placement in her design as that cargo was to serve as ballast, keeping her steady in even the roughest seas.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAdditionally, ''Celtic'' was to be designed with far greater capacities for both passengers and cargo. Her plans called for accommodations for a staggering 2,859 passengers: 347 in First Class, 160 in Second Class, and a total of 2,352 in Third Class, the latter being largest capacity seen of any liner on the North Atlantic at the time. Passenger accommodations were spread across six decks, titled from top to bottom: Boat Deck (A Deck), Upper Promenade (B Deck), Promenade (C Deck), Saloon (D Deck), Upper (E Deck) and Lower (F Deck). First Class accommodations were located amidships on the uppermost four decks and included a lounge and smoke room on the Boat Deck, as well as a grand and spacious dining room on the Saloon Deck. Second Class accommodations were allocated to the starboard sides of the Saloon and Upper Decks. Like as seen aboard ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', and ''Oceanic'', Second Class passengers were provided with their own smoke room and library, housed within a separate deckhouse situated just aft of the main superstructure, directly beneath which on the Saloon Deck was located their dining room.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20</ref>\n\nWhat made ''Celtic'' rather exceptional for the time was her Third Class accommodations, which in addition to ample open deck space on the Promenade Deck, were located on the Saloon, Upper and Lower Decks at both the forward and aft ends of the vessel, with a vast majority being located aft. The pattern followed that as was seen on all White Star vessels on the North Atlantic, with single men berthed forward, and single women, married couples and families berthed aft. On the Saloon Deck, in addition to baths and lavatories both forward and aft, were located two large dining rooms at the far after end of the deck, situated side by side, which when meals weren't being served respectively functioned as smoke and general rooms. An additional, fairly larger dining room was located directly beneath these on the Upper Deck, while a fourth dining room was located forward where single men were to be berthed, for which this dining room was equipped with a service bar. Aside from this, the biggest change brought by the ''Celtic'' for Third Class passengers was in sleeping quarters. In these days, open berths were still fairly common on the North Atlantic, which White Star had from the start gradually shied away from. Aboard the ''Oceanic'' class liners, ''Britannic'' and ''Germanic'', steerage passengers had been provided with large rooms which generally slept around 20 people, while aboard ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'' the usage of two and four berth cabins had been introduced, but only for married couples and families with children, a policy which also held with ''Cymric'' and ''Oceanic''. ''Celtic'' broke that mold. At the forward end of the vessel, located in two compartments on the Lower Deck were accommodations of the older style of sleeping arrangements, each compartment providing for 300 single men. The remaining 1,752 berths were located aft, all of which consisted of two, four and six berth cabins.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 13, 20.</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 1899, just two months after ''Oceanic'' was launched, the first keel plates of the ''Celtic'' were laid at Harland & Wolff. Construction progressed on her rapidly, and as White Star had planned, the new fleet of liners would be constructed in overlapping succession, as in October 1900, while ''Celtic''s hull was nearing completion, construction began on the second ship, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]''. When ''Celtic'' was launched in April 1901, there was much fanfare, as she was hailed the largest ship in the world in terms of tonnage, as well as being the first to exceed the tonnage of the infamous ''Great Eastern''. She took a mere four additional months for fitting out before sailing on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 26 July of that year.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". pp. 10, 15\u201320.</ref> Upon her entry into service, one of her most attractive features was her seaworthiness, as on her maiden voyage it was noted how while at sea, she was \"as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.\"<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 7</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, construction on ''Cedric'' had proceeded as planned and she was launched on 21 August 1902. Although she was of exactly the same dimensions as ''Celtic'' in length and width, she outweighed her twin by a mere 155 tons, making her now the largest ship in the world. Despite their similarities, the two had distinct differences. Aboard ''Cedric'', First Class accommodations included more private bathrooms as well as more suites consisting of interconnecting cabins provided with sitting rooms.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 33</ref> In all, she had accommodations for 2,600 passengers, with a slightly increased number of First Class passengers at 350, her Second Class capacity was increased to 250, while Third Class was scaled back to approximately 2,000. ''Cedric'' entered service later that winter, departing Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 11 February 1903.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", p. 9</ref>\n\nThe keel of the third sister, ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' had been laid down at Harland & Wolff in June 1902, while construction on ''Cedric'' was still underway. One notable instance in her construction was once her keel was fitted in place, White Star gave orders for her length to be extended by 28 feet. This change in plans required builders to cut her keel in two, move the after end backwards and install the new addition in between. Their reasons for this addition was likely to provide more spaces for passenger accommodations, which combined added up to 2,850 passengers Although ''Baltic'' was designed with the same layout for Third Class passengers as ''Cedric'', with a capacity of 2,000, her First and Second Class capacities were significantly greater. First Class was increased to a capacity for 425 passengers, while capacity for Second Class was extended to 450 passengers, almost twice that of ''Cedric'' and three times that of ''Celtic''. Simultaneously, the added length also increased her gross tonnage to 23,884, making her now the largest ship in the world. ''Baltic'' was launched on 12 November 1903, subsequently fitted out and delivered to White Star on 23 June 1904, and sailed on her maiden voyage on 29 June.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 13\u201315.</ref>\n\nWhile the first three members of the highly regarded quartet of liners were built and put into service with little problems, the fourth and final ship, ''[[RMS Adriatic (1906)|Adriatic]]'', experienced a considerable delay in her construction. Initially, her construction had commenced in November 1902 while ''Baltic'' was still being built, but a series of delays slowed her construction to a snail's pace as compared to that of her sisters. For example, the timeline of construction on ''Baltic'' between the laying of her keel and her launch was roughly 17 months. By the time ''Adriatic'' was finally launched in September 1906, she'd been under construction for almost 46 months, more than twice the time needed to construct her twin.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 54</ref> In her design, her passenger accommodations followed the same trend as seen with ''Baltic'', with added focus on the upper two classes while still maintaining the high standard for Third Class. Her overall passenger capacity was also identical to that of ''Baltic'' at 2,850, but with differences in capacities for each class, with First Class increased to 450, Second Class increased to 500 and Third Class scaled back to 1,900. Unlike her sisters however, she was unable to attain the title of world's largest ship at the time of her completion, as her 24,451 gross tonnage was just barely outmatched by Hamburg Amerika's ''Kaiserin Auguste Victoria'', which measured at 24,581 tons and entered service four months prior to the launch of ''Adriatic''. She would, however, rank briefly as the largest British-built ship until Cunard's famous greyhound ''Lusitania'' came into service the following year.<ref>\"The Titanic Commutator\", Volume VII, Issue II, Summer 1983. \"The Big Four of the White Star, Part 1\", pp. 16\u201317.</ref> She sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 8 May 1907, and not long afterwards gained a considerable reputation for her interiors, enough for the British tabloid ''The Bystander'' to dub her 'The Liner Luxurious'. One of her most notable innovations was that she was the first liner to have an onboard Turkish Bath and swimming pool.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 61</ref>\n\n===Intermediate liners and rapid expansion, 1903\u201307===\n\nAs White Star gradually brought the 'Big Four' into service, they also attained several smaller 'intermediate' liners in preparation for a considerable expansion of their passenger services on the North Atlantic. In 1903 alone they came to obtain five new liners, beginning with ''Arabic''. Originally laid down as ''Minnewaska'' for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was transferred to White Star prior to completion and was launched under her new name on 18 December 1902. Similar in size and appearance to ''Cymric'' with a single funnel and four masts, she measured at 600 feet in length with a beam of 65 feet, weighing in at 15,801 gross tons with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of a service speed of 16 knots. She was fitted with fairly modest accommodations for 1,400 passengers: 200 in First Class, 200 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. She sailed on her maiden voyage out of Liverpool to New York on 26 June 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the IMMCo. takeover under J. Pierpont Morgan, White Star obtained four newly completed liners in the last months of 1903, they being the ''Columbus'', ''Commonwealth'', ''New England'' and ''Mayflower''. These four liners had been owned and operated by the Dominion Line for their services between Liverpool and Boston as well as their Mediterranean cruising and emigrant route, which also connected to Boston. However, the Dominion Line was also absorbed into the IMM scheme and the four ships were transferred to White Star. In addition to the acquisition of these ships, White Star also acquired control of the routes as well. Upon their acquisition by White Star, the four liners were respectively renamed ''Republic'', ''Cretic'', ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic''. These four ships were greatly similar in appearance to the ''Cymric'' and ''Arabic'', all with a single funnel with two or four masts, with engines geared to twin screws capable of service speeds between 14 and 16 knots. They all also fell within the same range in terms of dimensions, with lengths between 550 and 582 feet, beams between 59 and 67 feet, and gross tonnage as follows, ''Republic'' at 15,378 tons, ''Cretic'' 13,518 tons, ''Romanic'' at 11,394 tons and ''Canopic'' at 12,097 tons. There was, however, considerable variances in passenger capacities. ''Republic'', which in time would come to obtain the nickname 'The Millionaire's Ship', had the largest capacity with accommodations for 2,400 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 2,000 Third Class). The three remaining ships had considerably smaller capacities, with the ''Cretic'' designed with accommodations for 1,510 passengers (260 First Class, 250 Second Class, 1,000 Third Class), ''Romanic'' with accommodations for 1,200 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 800 Third Class) and ''Canopic'' with accommodations for 1,277 passengers (275 First Class, 232 Second Class, 770 Third Class).<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\">De Kerbrech, Richard. \"Ships of the White Star Line\". pp. 113\u2013118.</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of their service under Dominion in the late fall of 1903, the four liners were briefly withdrawn from service, their names redone, funnels repainted in White Star colors, and made ready for their new services. ''Romanic'' was the first to enter service under White Star, sailing for Boston on 19 November, followed by ''Cretic'' on 26 November. In order to balance the schedule between the Liverpool and Mediterranean services to Boston, ''Cymric'' was transferred to the Liverpool-Boston route, departing Liverpool for her first trip to Boston on 10 December, while ''Republic'' entered service to Boston on 17 December. ''Canopic'' completed the service upon her departure from Liverpool on 14 January 1904. Upon their arrivals in Boston, ''Romanic'' and ''Canopic'' were both immediately transferred to the Mediterranean services formerly upheld by the Dominion Line. This route followed a line which first made port at [[Sao Miguel Island|Sao Miguel]] in the [[Azores]] before passing through the straits of Gibraltar and making port in Naples and Genoa. ''Republic'' was also put into service on the Mediterranean route following her first crossing to Boston, but only for the first half of the 1904 season, as come summer she was switched back to the Liverpool-Boston service until winter, a pattern of divided seasons between  the North Atlantic and Mediterranean routes which she would follow for the remainder of her career. ''Cretic'' remained on the Liverpool-Boston service running opposite ''Cymric'' for a full year until November 1904, when alongside ''Republic'' she began sailing on a secondary service to the Mediterranean from New York.<ref name=\"Kerbrech, Richard p. 113-118\"/>\n\n[[File:Canute Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|Canute Chambers, former White Star Line offices in Southampton]]\nIn the early months of 1907, White Star began preparations for another extension of their services on the North Atlantic by establishing an 'Express' service to New York. The new service would terminate out of Southampton every Wednesday, first heading south across the English Channel to the French port of Cherbourg that evening, then sailing back across the channel to Queenstown the following morning before proceeding to New York. On eastbound crossings, ships would forego calling at Queenstown and make port at Plymouth, before proceeding to Cherbourg and Southampton. Because of its proximity to London, Southampton had a clear advantage over Liverpool in reducing travelling time, while by establishing a terminal at Cherbourg White Star had established a route which allowed travelers to embark or disembark at either a British or Continental port.<ref>Chirnside, Mark. \"The 'Big Four' of the White Star Fleet\". p. 66</ref> Another subsidiary of IMM, the [[American Line]], had moved their operations to Southampton in 1893 and established an express service via Cherbourg which had proved very successful, thus prompting White Star to make a similar move.<ref>Flayhart, William H. \"The American Line: 1871\u20131902\". p. 139.</ref> ''Celtic'' embarked on two experimental crossings from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown, first on 20 April and then again on 18 May, which proved successful and set the way for the establishment of the route, which was to be maintained by ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', ''Oceanic'' and the newly completed ''Adriatic''. ''Celtic'' was returned to the Liverpool service after the second crossing, and her place taken on the new run by ''Adriatic'', which sailed from Southampton for the first time on 5 June, followed by ''Teutonic'' on 12 June, ''Oceanic'' on 19 June and ''Majestic'' on 26 June.\n\n=== Olympic class ships ===\n{{Main|Olympic-class ocean liner}}\n[[File:RMS Titanic 1.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' of 1912 (46,328 GRT)]]\nThe Cunard Line was the chief competitor to White Star. In response to Cunard's [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']], White Star ordered the ''Olympic'' class liners: [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']]. While Cunard was famed for the speed of their ships, the ''Olympic'' class were to be the largest and most luxurious ships in the world. ''Olympic'', however, was the only ship of this class to have a successful career. ''Titanic'' sank on her maiden voyage in April 1912, while ''Britannic'' was requisitioned by the British government while she was still being fitted out, and was used as a [[hospital ship]] during [[World War I]]. ''Britannic'' hit an underwater mine in the Kea Channel and sank on the morning of 21 November 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britannic-sinks-in-aegean-sea|title=Britannic sinks in Aegean Sea \u2013 Nov 21, 1916 |website=History.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nLike many other shipping lines, the White Star Line suffered heavy losses during the [[First World War]] which began in August 1914, including some of their most prestigious vessels. The first major war loss was of [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1899, which was converted into an [[armed merchant cruiser]] and ran aground near the [[Shetland Islands]] due to navigational error in September 1914. The first White Star ship lost to enemy action was the liner [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in August 1915 with the loss of 44 lives.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=181\u2013183|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref>\n\n1916 would see the largest loss of the war, Titanic's sister ship [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']] which was sunk near the Greek island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] in May after striking a [[naval mine]], while in service as a [[hospital ship]]. ''Britannic'' was the largest loss for the company, and also the [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|largest ship sunk]] during the conflict. 1916 also saw the loss of the liner [[SS Cymric|''Cymric'']] which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in May, and also of the cargo ship [[SS Georgic (1895)|''Georgic'']], which was scuttled in December with its cargo of 1,200 horses still on board, after being intercepted in the Atlantic by the German [[merchant raider]] {{SMS|M\u00f6we|1914|6}}.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n1917 saw the loss of the liner [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] in January which struck a mine off the Irish coast and sank with the loss of 354 lives and 3,211 gold ingots. The following month the liner [[SS Afric|''Afric'']] was sunk by a torpedo in the English Channel, as was the liner [[SS Delphic (1897)|''Delphic'']] in August.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nMany White Star vessels were requisitioned for various types of war service, most commonly for use as [[troop ship]]s, the most notable of these was the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] which transported over 200,000 troops during the conflict.<ref>Chirnside, Mark (2011). The 'Olympic' Class Ships. The History Press. p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-5895-3}}.</ref><ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\n=== Interwar years ===\n[[File:White Star Line Routes and Ships 1923.jpg|thumb|right|White Star Line routes and steamer fleet, 1923]]\nThe losses of the ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic'' left ''Olympic'' as the only surviving member of White Star's planned trio of express liners. In 1922 the White Star Line obtained two former German liners which had been ceded to Britain as [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ostensibly as replacements for the war losses of ''Britannic'', ''Oceanic'', ''Arabic'', ''Cymric'' and ''Laurentic''.: The former ''SS Bismarck'' which was renamed [[RMS Majestic (1914)|''Majestic'']], and the former ''SS Columbus'' which was renamed [[RMS Homeric (1913)|''Homeric'']]. At 56,551 gross tons,  ''Majestic'' was then the world's largest liner and became the company's flagship. The two former German liners operated successfully alongside ''Olympic'' for an express service on the Southampton\u2013New York route until the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand after 1930.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn the immediate post-war period there was a boom in the transatlantic emigrant trade, from which White Star was able to benefit for a time, however this trade was badly affected by the American [[Immigration Act of 1924]] which introduced quotas for immigrants to the United States. This hit the profits of the shipping lines, for whom the emigrant trade had been a staple for nearly a century. However the growth in [[tourism]] was to some degree able to offset the decline of the emigrant trade, and White Star made efforts to appeal to this new breed of traveller by gradually overhauling liners still in service and re-configuring Third Class accommodations as Tourist Class.<ref name=\"KerbrechWWIPW\"/>\n\nIn 1927 the White Star Line was purchased by the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] (RMSPC), making RMSPC the largest shipping group in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsoll.org/OnTheLine/ShippingLines/royalmail/default.asp#2 |title=Fact file \u2013 PortCities Southampton |website=Plimsoll.org |date= |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: The Kylsant years |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208010107/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index3.html |archive-date=8 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 a new [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic (III)]] was proposed and her keel was laid down that year at Harland and Wolff. The thousand foot long liner was to have been a [[motor ship]] propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system, but the ship was never completed due to financial issues. ''Oceanic'''s keel was dismantled and the steel was used in two new smaller motor ships: [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'' (III)]] and [[MV Georgic (1932)|''Georgic'' (II)]]. Both of these ships entered service by 1932; they were the last liners White Star had built.\n\nRMSPC ran into financial trouble, and was liquidated in 1932. A new company, Royal Mail Lines Limited, took over the ships of RMSPC and their subordinate lines including White Star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |title=The Royal Mail Story: Royal Mail Lines, Ltd |website=Users.on.net |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083323/http://www.users.on.net/~snicol/story/index4.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Georgic postcard.jpg|thumb|[[MV Georgic (1932)|MV ''Georgic'']]; the last ship to be built for the White Star Line before the merger.]]\n\n=== Cunard merger ===\n[[File:Cunard White Star Line Logo.JPG|thumbpx|thumbnail|left|''Cunard-White Star'' Logo]]\nIn 1933 White Star and Cunard were both in serious financial difficulties because of the [[Great Depression]], falling passenger numbers and the advanced age of their fleets. Work was halted on Cunard's new giant, Hull 534 (later the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]) in 1931 to save money. In 1933 the British government agreed to provide assistance to the two competitors on the condition that they merge their North Atlantic operations. The agreement was completed on 30 December 1933.\n\nThe merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating [[Cunard-White Star Limited]]. White Star contributed ten ships to the new company while Cunard contributed 15 ships. Because of this, and since Hull 534 was Cunard's ship, 62% of the company was owned by Cunard's shareholders and 38% of the company was owned for the benefit of White Star's creditors. White Star's Australia and New Zealand services were not involved in the merger, but were separately disposed of to Shaw, Savill & Albion later in 1934. A year after this merger, [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], the last of her class, was removed from service. She was scrapped in 1937.\n\nIn 1947 Cunard acquired the 38% of Cunard White Star they did not already own, and on 31 December 1949 they acquired Cunard-White Star's assets and operations, and reverted to using the name \"Cunard\" on 1 January 1950. From the time of the 1934 merger, the house flags of both lines had been flown on all their ships, with each ship flying the flag of its original owner above the other, but from 1950, even [[MV Georgic (1931)|''Georgic'']]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/georgic/ |title=Georgic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010 }}</ref> and [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'']],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/history-fleet/cunard-white-star/fleet-details/britannic/ |title=Britannic |work=Chris' Cunard Page |date= |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> the last surviving White Star liners, flew the Cunard house flag above the White Star burgee until they were each withdrawn from service, in 1956 and 1961 respectively.

However, in the late 1890s White Star decided to reinstate a service to Australia, partly because of the discovery of further gold deposits in [[Western Australia]] leading to another series of gold rushes and an increased traffic in emigrants to Australia, while there was also an increasing trade in minerals, agricultural produce, wool and meat in the other direction. The latter had become a major source of revenue for shipping lines already on the route after the advent of effective mechanical [[refrigeration]] systems in the late 1880s, allowing large quantities of cattle carcasses to be preserved on the long voyage back to the [[British Isles]].\n\nThomas Ismay decided to re-enter the Australian run in 1897 with a monthly service between [[Liverpool]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Sydney]]. A stop at [[Tenerife]] was included in the schedule both outbound and inbound. Outbound ships would call at [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] and the return trip would call at [[Plymouth]] before ending at Liverpool. With that route taking six weeks, five ships would be needed to maintain the service in both directions. The specification for the new ships was drawn up and the order placed with Harland & Wolff in the summer of 1897, coinciding with the [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], thus they became known as the [[Jubilee-class ocean liner]]s.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=78\u201389|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> In keeping with White Star's new philosophy on the Atlantic of size over speed, the Jubilee-class were to be the largest ships ever put on the Australia run, at 550&nbsp;ft (168 metres) in length and nearly 12,000 gross tons. They were single-funnel, twin-screw ships designed as mixed cargo/passenger vessels, being in essence enlarged versions of White Star's [[SS Naronic|Naronic-class]] ships.<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=50\u201354}}</ref> With a service speed of 14 knots the Jubilee-class were significantly slower than the smaller mailships run by the [[Orient Line]] and [[P&O (company)|P&O]]. Their size meant they could not transit the [[Suez Canal]] and would have to take the long route via South Africa so would not attract first-class passengers. Instead they were intended for the emigrant/seasonal worker traffic, carrying 320 passengers solely in what was described as third-class accommodation. However, following White Star's long tradition of improving standards for third-class passengers, these facilities were considerably ahead of the equivalent on other lines, being broadly in line with second-class facilities on other ships. Although all of the same class, prices for berths on the Jubilee-class varied, allowing passengers the choice of two- or four-berth cabins for a premium or open dormitories. Passengers had use of facilities such as a large dining room, a library and a smoking room, as well as free run of nearly all the ship's deck space during the voyage. The ships could carry 15,000 tons of cargo in seven holds, including capacity for 100,000 meat carcasses.<ref name=\"NQR\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81645587 |title=A Mammoth Steamship.

The final pair of ships for the Australia run were to a modified design following the experiences with the original trio. The Australia Run proved to be more popular with passengers than expected so these two ships, [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] and [[SS Suevic|''Suevic'']] had their bridges moved forward and their poop decks extended.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/><ref name=\"Haws\"/> As well as slightly increasing their gross tonnage this gave them capacity for a further 50 passengers, bringing the total to 400. ''Suevic'' made her maiden voyage in May 1901, bringing White Star's new Australian service to full strength. By now the return voyage also included a stop at [[London]] \u2013 most passengers from Australia disembarked at Plymouth, to go to their final destination by railway, while much of the cargo was bound for London. The ship would then steam back through the [[English Channel]] to offload the last of her cargo and passengers at Liverpool before preparing for the next voyage. \n[[File:PERSIC_on_left_and_CERAMIC_on_right,_both_of_the_White_Star_Line._(3307507923).jpg|thumb|''Persic'' (left) and ''Ceramic'' (right) loading at [[Sydney]] in the 1920s.]]\nThe Australian Run was successful and profitable for White Star, and largely uneventful for the ships. In the earliest days of the route the initial three ships were heavily used to transport men, soldiers and supplies to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], while ''Suevic'' [[SS Suevic#Shipwreck|ran aground]] off [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] in dramatic fashion in 1907, but there were no casualties and, despite the ship being broken in two, she was repaired and reentered service in January 1908.<ref name=\"Haws\"/> The success of the new Australian service in terms of freight led to White Star transferring an older cargo-only ship of a similar size to the Jubilee-class, the [[SS Cevic (1893)|''Cevic'']], from the New York service to the Australia Run. In 1910 ''Cevic'' was used to experiment with routing ships to Australia via the [[Suez Canal]] but she ran aground several times in the canal and the ships remained on the route via the Cape. ''Cevic'' was used on the Australia Run on a seasonale basis, mainly carrying cattle and wool at the end of the Australian autumn (February\u2013April) and then being switched to the New York Run during the Atlantic summer.\n\nContinued demand for extra passenger capacity led to White Star building a one-off ship for the route. Launched in 1913, [[SS Ceramic|''Ceramic'']] was a larger, more sophisticated development of the Jubilee-class, at 655 feet (200 metres) in length and 18,495 gross tons. Like the [[SS Laurentic (1908)|''Laurentic'']] and the [[Olympic-class ocean liner|Olympic-class]], ''Ceramic'' was a triple-screw ship with the central propeller driven by a low-pressure turbine using exhaust from the two recriprocating steam engines. This enabled her to be slightly faster \u2013 16 knots \u2013 than the Jubilee-class vessels despite her extra size for a minimal increase in coal consumption. The new ship had a significantly larger superstructure and nearly double the passenger capacity of the Jubilee-class ships \u2013 a total of 600 passengers, still carried only in what was advertised as third-class accommodation. She could also carry 19,000 tons cargo in eight holds, including 321,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space.<ref name=\"Hardy\">{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Clare|title=SS Ceramic, The Untold Story|date=2006|pages=19\u201320|ISBN=1 904908 64 0}}</ref> The dimensions of ''Ceramic'' were restricted by the length of the quay at London's [[Port of Tilbury]] and the clearance for the masts under the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. When she arrived in Sydney in September 1914 she took the place of the Jubilee-class ships as the largest vessels put on the Australia Run from Britain and became the tallest ship to pass under the bridge.<ref name=\"Hardy\"/>\n\nAll seven ships were requisitioned as troop transports during the [[World War I]], forcing White Star to suspend the regular Australia service. ''Afric'' was torpedoed by a [[U-Boat]] in the English Channel in 1917 and ''Cevic'' remained in the ownership of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] after the war but the other five ships were returned to White Star and the service was resumed in 1919. The remaining Jubilee-class liners were withdrawn from White Star service in the late 1920s. ''Persic'' was scrapped in 1926 while the other three were sold in 1928 (''Medic'' and ''Suevic'') and 1929 (''Runic''). All were converted into whaling [[factory ship]]s on account of their size and cargo capacity. The Australia Run was no longer so lucrative or as heavily-trafficked as it had been before the war and the route was no longer a priority for White Star, especially once it came under the ownership of the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] in 1927. A new ship, intended to be the first of a new class to replace the Jubilee-class, had been launched in 1917 - the [[SS Vedic|''Vedic'']]. This was the first White Star Line ship to be powered solely by [[steam turbine|turbines]] and had the same emigrant/cargo-carrying role as her predecessors, although at 460 feet (140 metres) and 9,332 gross tons she was smaller than the older ships. ''Vedic'' went straight from the builders to service as a troopship and was initially used on White Star's Canadian service until she was put on the Australia Run in 1925. Between them ''Ceramic'' and ''Vedic'' maintained a less-intensive Australian service until their owners merged with the [[Cunard Line]]. The new management immediately decided to end White Star's routes to the southern hemisphere \u2013 ''Ceramic'' was sold to [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]], which continued to operate her on the same route, while ''Vedic'' was scrapped.\n\n== White Star Line today ==\n\n[[File:SS Nomadic March 2012.jpg|thumb|Last surviving White Star ship, [[SS Nomadic (1911)|SS ''Nomadic'']], as she appeared in 2012, drydocked in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland]]\n\nThe White Star Line's Head Offices still exist in Liverpool, standing in James Street within sight of the more grandiose headquarters of their rivals, the Cunard Building.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.
