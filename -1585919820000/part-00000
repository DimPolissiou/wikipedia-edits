She is the fourth child of Luis Otero, a retired mechanic, and Nellie Cintr\u00f3n. When Otero was five years old, her family settled in Yauco where her parents bought a piece of land and decided to build their dream home.\n\nAfter the house was complete, her father joined the National Guard and was sent to the mainland to begin boot camp while her mother struggled between work, school, and four kids. At the age of 9, Otero saw the Gloria Estefan Let It Loose Homecoming Concert. She remarked to her mother: \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to do that!\u201d and soon after, Otero's dream of professionally pursuing music began.\n\nAs a child, Otero would create her own \u201chome concerts\u201d imitating Gloria Estefan and others. She struggled finding venues at which to perform live due to her choice to perform in English while she was, at the time, living in a Spanish-speaking country. She performed at many local talent shows. On several occasions she won second place to later be told by the judges that she had not been awarded first place because of her choice to perform in English.\n\nBy the time Otero was close to 14, her mother decided to help her create a professional demo. A local recording studio called The Time Machine, run by Ivan Nazario, a well-respected producer in Puerto Rico, was opening in town and her mother immediately contacted them to inquire about pricing. She became their first customer but was unable to record there because the studio was not finished. They set out to San Juan, Puerto Rico and recorded at the Horizon Studios to record the covers \u201cThe Rose\u201d by Bette Midler and \u201cYou Mean The World To Me\u201d by Toni Braxton.\n\n== Once In A Lifetime Concert 1998 ==\n\nDuring her final months in high school, Otero and her mother began working on her first concert ever in which she titled Once In A Lifetime.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM-0vvaiTpQ Beginnings: Once In A Lifetime Concert]</ref> By 1995, American music became very popular and performing in English was not that much of a struggle anymore. The concert had many local businesses, schools and friends involved allowing Melissa to perform at the Starz Theater in Yauco, Puerto Rico. They sold over 300 tickets and was deemed a \u201chuge success\u201d for no other independent artist had been able to accomplish such an event while performing in another language.\n\n== Depression ==\n\nDuring the summer of 2006, Melissa had released her single \u201cMy First Everything\u201d but was struggling with depression. She did however continue writing and began her journey in writing 'My Spirit\" <ref>[http://www.bayside-times.com/articles/2009/03/02/astoria_times/arts/astoria_times_artsbsrqkvm02252009.txt Astorian Sings of Faith, Depression on New CD]</ref>\n\n== Angels and Demons ==\n\nDuring the months of July 2011 and August 2011, Melissa's new promotional track \"Angels and Demons\" was featured on US Airways as part of the Sonicbids Indie Showcase.

Her debut album ''[[My Spirit (album)|My Spirit]]''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713191543/http://www.lavozhispanany.com/PDF/lavoz-07-23-29-09.pdf Article in La Voz Hispana]</ref> was released on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] of 2008 and has sold over 500 digital copies most of which were from fans in Colombia and New York City.\n\nOtero recently{{when|date=December 2013}} wrapped up her Free Spirit Tour<ref>[http://www.prlog.org/10248470-melissa-otero-embarks-on-first-us-tour.html Melissa Otero Embarks on First US Tour]</ref> which included performances in New York, [[Puerto Rico]] and throughout the Fox Valley of the [[Wisconsin|State of Wisconsin]] during the summer of 2009.\n\nAs of 2011, in addition to her touring, Otero began working on her second album with Secret Sounds, CEO/producer Stefan Moessle titled \"Angels and Demons\".\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMelissa Otero Cintr\u00f3n was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in the countryside of Yauco, Puerto Rico. She is the fourth child of Luis Otero, a retired mechanic, and Nellie Cintr\u00f3n. When Otero was five years old, her family settled in Yauco where her parents bought a piece of land and decided to build their dream home.\n\nAfter the house was complete, her father joined the National Guard and was sent to the mainland to begin boot camp while her mother struggled between work, school, and four kids. At the age of 9, Otero saw the Gloria Estefan Let It Loose Homecoming Concert. She remarked to her mother: \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to do that!\u201d and soon after, Otero's dream of professionally pursuing music began.\n\nAs a child, Otero would create her own \u201chome concerts\u201d imitating Gloria Estefan and others. She struggled finding venues at which to perform live due to her choice to perform in English while she was, at the time, living in a Spanish-speaking country. She performed at many local talent shows. On several occasions she won second place to later be told by the judges that she had not been awarded first place because of her choice to perform in English.\n\nBy the time Otero was close to 14, her mother decided to help her create a professional demo. A local recording studio called The Time Machine, run by Ivan Nazario, a well-respected producer in Puerto Rico, was opening in town and her mother immediately contacted them to inquire about pricing. She became their first customer but was unable to record there because the studio was not finished. They set out to San Juan, Puerto Rico and recorded at the Horizon Studios to record the covers \u201cThe Rose\u201d by Bette Midler and \u201cYou Mean The World To Me\u201d by Toni Braxton.\n\n== Once In A Lifetime Concert 1998 ==\n\nDuring her final months in high school, Otero and her mother began working on her first concert ever in which she titled Once In A Lifetime.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM-0vvaiTpQ Beginnings: Once In A Lifetime Concert]</ref> By 1995, American music became very popular and performing in English was not that much of a struggle anymore. The concert had many local businesses, schools and friends involved allowing Melissa to perform at the Starz Theater in Yauco, Puerto Rico. They sold over 300 tickets and was deemed a \u201chuge success\u201d for no other independent artist had been able to accomplish such an event while performing in another language.\n\n== Depression ==\n\nDuring the summer of 2006, Melissa had released her single \u201cMy First Everything\u201d but was struggling with depression. She did however continue writing and began her journey in writing 'My Spirit\" <ref>[http://www.bayside-times.com/articles/2009/03/02/astoria_times/arts/astoria_times_artsbsrqkvm02252009.txt Astorian Sings of Faith, Depression on New CD]</ref>\n\n== Angels and Demons ==\n\nDuring the months of July 2011 and August 2011, Melissa's new promotional track \"Angels and Demons\" was featured on US Airways as part of the Sonicbids Indie Showcase.

The error may also be used when a server does not wish to disclose whether it has the requested information or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe website hosting server will typically generate a \"404 Not Found\" web page when a user attempts to follow a [[link rot|broken or dead link]]; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nWhen communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a [[web browser]] request for a [[web page]], with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sic Transit Gloria Telae: Towards an Understanding of the Web's Decay |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sic Transit Gloria Telae: Towards an Understanding of the Web's Decay |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

The slowest child to do so is faced with a penalty or becomes the \"rosie\" (literally: [[rose]] tree, from the French ''rosier'') and takes their place in the center of the ring. \n\nVariations, corruptions, and vulgarized versions were noted to be in use long before the earliest printed publications.

All of us going hush, hush, hush!\" The rhyme is well known in Germany with the first line \"''Ringel, Ringel, Reihe''\" (as the popular collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' gave it); it has many local variants, often with \"''Husch, husch, husch''\" (which in German could mean \"quick, quick\") in the fourth line,<ref>B\u00f6hme (1897), pp. 438\u201341, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227.

The shorter goes this way:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\ncasca il mondo,\ncasca la Terra,\ntutti gi\u00f9 per terra!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nWhich roughly translates this way: \"(We) turn, turn around, the world falls down, Earth falls down, we all fall down (to the ground)!\". It is to be noticed that in Italian the word ''terra'' means both ''Earth'' and ''ground''. There is a slightly longer version that reads:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\nquant'\u00e8 bello il mondo\nil mondo dei bambini,\ncon tanti fiorellini.\nCentocinquanta, la gallina canta,\ncanta sola sola, non vuole andare a scuola,\nla gallina bianca e nera, ti d\u00e0 la buonasera\nti d\u00e0 la buonanotte, il lupo \u00e8 dietro la porta,\nla porta casca gi\u00f9, il lupo non c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9\nA terra tutti gi\u00f9!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe translation is: \"(We) turn, turn around, how beautiful is the world, the world of the children, with many little flowers. One hundred fifty, the chicken sings, she sings all alone (because) she doesn't want to go to the school, the chicken is white and black, she says good evening, she says good night, the wolf hides behind the door, the door falls down, the wolf disappears and we all fall down!\"\nWhile singing the longer version, children often form two circles one inside the other, which turn in opposite directions; when the verse changes, the direction of the circle changes too, and if someone goes wrong he or she is sent off.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[File:RingaRosesTumbleDown.jpg|thumb|Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862\u20131940) for \"All Tumble Down\" from Anon, ''Ring O' Roses'' (1922)]]\nThe origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. Folklore scholars, however, regard the Great Plague explanation that has been the most common since the mid-20th century as baseless. \n\n===Theories from the late 19th century===\nIn 1898, ''A Dictionary of British Folklore'' contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the ''Sheffield Glossary'' comparison of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, \"Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold.\" It claimed the first instance to be indicative of pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a \"ring\" around the roses and bowing with the \"all fall down\" as a [[curtsy]].<ref name=nutt /> In 1892, the American writer, [[Eugene Field]] wrote a poem titled ''Teeny-Weeny'' that specifically referred to [[fairy|fey]] folk playing ring-a-rosie.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2921540/the_osage_city_free_press/ | title=Children's Column | publisher=The Osage City Free Press (Osage City, Kansas) | date=25 August 1892 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | pages=6}}</ref> \n\nAccording to ''Games and Songs of American Children'', published in 1883, the \"rosie\" was a reference to the French word for [[Rhododendron ponticum|rose tree]] and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center.<ref name=\"newell\"/> Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme.

All of us going hush, hush, hush!\" The rhyme is well known in Germany with the first line \"''Ringel, Ringel, Reihe''\" (as the popular collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' gave it); it has many local variants, often with \"''Husch, husch, husch''\" (which in German could mean \"quick, quick\") in the fourth line,<ref>B\u00f6hme (1897), pp. 438\u201341, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227.

The shorter goes this way:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\ncasca il mondo,\ncasca la Terra,\ntutti gi\u00f9 per terra!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nWhich roughly translates this way: \"(We) turn, turn around, the world falls down, Earth falls down, we all fall down (to the ground)!\". It is to be noticed that in Italian the word ''terra'' means both ''Earth'' and ''ground''. There is a slightly longer version that reads:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nGiro Girotondo,\nquant'\u00e8 bello il mondo\nil mondo dei bambini,\ncon tanti fiorellini.\nCentocinquanta, la gallina canta,\ncanta sola sola, non vuole andare a scuola,\nla gallina bianca e nera, ti d\u00e0 la buonasera\nti d\u00e0 la buonanotte, il lupo \u00e8 dietro la porta,\nla porta casca gi\u00f9, il lupo non c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9\nA terra tutti gi\u00f9!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe translation is: \"(We) turn, turn around, how beautiful is the world, the world of the children, with many little flowers. One hundred fifty, the chicken sings, she sings all alone (because) she doesn't want to go to the school, the chicken is white and black, she says good evening, she says good night, the wolf hides behind the door, the door falls down, the wolf disappears and we all fall down!\"\nWhile singing the longer version, children often form two circles one inside the other, which turn in opposite directions; when the verse changes, the direction of the circle changes too, and if someone goes wrong he or she is sent off.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[File:RingaRosesTumbleDown.jpg|thumb|Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862\u20131940) for \"All Tumble Down\" from Anon, ''Ring O' Roses'' (1922)]]\nThe origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. Folklore scholars, however, regard the Great Plague explanation that has been the most common since the mid-20th century as baseless. \n\n===Theories from the late 19th century===\nIn 1898, ''A Dictionary of British Folklore'' contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the ''Sheffield Glossary'' comparison of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, \"Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold.\" It claimed the first instance to be indicative of pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a \"ring\" around the roses and bowing with the \"all fall down\" as a [[curtsy]].<ref name=nutt /> In 1892, the American writer, [[Eugene Field]] wrote a poem titled ''Teeny-Weeny'' that specifically referred to [[fairy|fey]] folk playing ring-a-rosie.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2921540/the_osage_city_free_press/ | title=Children's Column | publisher=The Osage City Free Press (Osage City, Kansas) | date=25 August 1892 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | pages=6}}</ref> \n\nAccording to ''Games and Songs of American Children'', published in 1883, the \"rosie\" was a reference to the French word for [[Rhododendron ponticum|rose tree]] and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center.<ref name=\"newell\"/> Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme.
