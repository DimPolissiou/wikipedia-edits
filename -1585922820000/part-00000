[[Api (mountain)|Api Himal]] ({{convert|7132|m|ft}}) and [[Jethi Bahurani]] ({{convert|6850|m|ft}}) are main mountain peaks of the area. There is a protected area named [[Api Nampa Conservation Area]] which ranges in elevation from {{convert|532|m|ft}} to {{convert|7132|m|ft}}. [[Mahakali river|Mahakali]], Chalune, Tinkar, Nampa and Kalagad are the rivers in the area.\n\nThe climate of the area is generally characterized by high rainfall and humidity. The climatic condition varies along with the elevation gradient. The climate of Darchula District varies widely from subtropical to alpine. In the north, most of the parts, having an alpine climate, remain under snow. In the southern part and valleys, the climate is subtropical. Mid- hills have a temperate climate. The average maximum temperature is 18.6&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum temperature is 7.7&nbsp;\u00b0C. The average rainfall is 2129mm. Most precipitation falls between May and September.\nAbout eighty percent of the total annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season (June to September). All areas experience very high rainfall intensities, ranging between estimates of {{cvt|125|\u2013|350|mm}} for a 24-hour period.\nWithin its elevation range of {{cvt|1800|m}} to {{cvt|6500|m}}, there are limited subtropical valleys in the southern margin although most of the area is ecologically temperate or highland. A cold, generally dry climate exists in the high alpine valleys just north of the southern arm of the Himalayan mountain range which cuts across the bottom of Darchula.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About 58.4 percent of the population falls below the poverty line. Population composition is made up of different castes, such as Kshatriya 63.55%, Brahmin 17.15%, Thakuri 4.01%, Dalit and others contribute 15.39 percent. Hindu followers are high in numbers. Hindu, Buddhists, as well as others, regard nature as a gift from God and they worship nature their own way.<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />\n\n===Ethnic composition===\nThe majority ethnic group is Pahari [[Aryan|Arya]].  Castes of Darchula District are Brahmin, Chhetries, Dalit, Thakuri, Lohar, Kaine, Newar, Byansi, Bandhe, Sanyasi etc. Among them 85.19% HHs are Brahmin/Chheties/Thakuri, 10% Dalits, 0.12% Sauka and others are occupational caste groups.

Of these, 95.9% spoke [[Doteli]], 2.5% [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and 0.5% [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] as their first language.<ref>[https://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/upLoads/2018/12/Volume05Part02.pdf 2011 Nepal Census, Social Characteristics Tables]</ref>\n\n==Economic development==\nDarchula is one of the least developed districts of the country. The major socioeconomic indicator of Darchula District is still very poor. Life expectancy of these people was about 52 in 1996. About 89.90% of the total population depends upon agriculture. Substance agriculture, lack of basic infrastructure, difficult geophysical condition, traditional agricultural practice, low literacy rate and population growth are the root causes for deeply rooted poverty.<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />\n\n==Trade and business==\nTrade is one of the most important means of livelihood. Every year, people from the hills come with NTFP, ghee, and herbs to sell. Agriculture related commodities are sold in local bazaars (markets). People of Byans, Rapla go to Tibet to fill their needs for clothes and other commodities. Local carpets and wool products, handmade clothes, and NTFP bring in huge amounts of money to the VDCs. However, each and every respondent indicated that their income is invested in domestic use.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Api Nampa Conservation Area]] is a famous gateway to Kailash Mansarobar's holy region located in Tibet. Many pilgrims pass through this Conservation Area to get to Kailash Pravat. Not only Nepalese but also foreigners visit Api Nampa Conservation Area to acquire satisfaction, spirituality and the boons of nature.\nThe first European, A. H. Savage Landor entered Nampa valley in 1899 and explored the glacier system. He travelled across the Tinkar valley and entered Tibet via the Lipu pass. In 1905, Dr. Longstaff visited this region. Then Swiss geologists A. Heim and A. Gansser visited the [[Api (mountain)|Api Himal]] area in 1936.\nThe elevation of Api Himal at the top is calculated to be 23,399&nbsp;ft. John Tyson and W. H. Murray explored this region in 1953. An Api group has been created to lure tourists wanting to see the geological features blending with nature and other natural assets. Sauka culture is also an attraction for tourist.\nApi Himal can be visited by going via Darchula Bazar, Huti, Sunsera, Rapla to base camp. It takes five days to reach there or travelers may go via Bitule, Makari Gad, Ghusa Village, Domilla, to Lolu at the base camp. Panoramic views of Himalayas are created by several peaks like Nampa, [[Jethi Bahurani]] and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Media/radio partners==\nTo Promote local culture there are few FM radio stations: Radio Samad FM 102.6 MHz,<ref>{{cite web|title= 50.Radio Samad FM 102.6&nbsp;MHz|url=http://www.acorab.org.np/index.php?pagename=memberDetail&memberId=83}}</ref> Radio Naya Nepal FM 104.5&nbsp;MHz,<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Naya Nepal FM 104.5&nbsp;MHz|url=http://www.nayanepalfm.com.np/}}</ref> Darchula FM, which are Community radio Stations.\n\n==Education==\n===Colleges and schools===\n*Darchula Multiple Campus\n*Gokuleshwar Higher Secondary School\n*Himalaya Higher Secondary School\n*Gokuleswar Multiple Campus \n*Sri Krishna Snatak Campus\n*Rastriya Campus\n*[[Mahendra Higher Secondary School]]\n*Shankarpur Higher Secondary School\n*Latinath Higher Secondary School\n*Srikrishana Higher Secondary School\n*Rastiya Higher Secondary School\n*Latinatha Higher Secondary School\n*Hunainath Secondary School Baaj (Mahara Village)\n*Hunainath Higher Secondary School\n*Janabikasa Higher Secondary School\n*Ganesh Binayak Higher Secondary School\n*Malikarjun Higher Secondary School\n*Krishana Higher Secondary School\n*Sarswati Higher Secondary School\n*Gurilamandu Higher Secondary School\n*Galainath Higher Secondary School\n*Satya Parkash Higher Secondary School\n*Sri Krishana Higher Secondary School\n*[[Apinampa Campus]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.un.org.np/sites/default/files/maps/district_maps/Darchula.pdf UN map of VDC boundaries, water features and roads in Darchula]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/DarchulaDistrict/ Darchula District On Facebook ]\n\n==See also==\n*{{statoids|id=ynp|title=Districts of Nepal}}\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre = Darchula\n|North = {{flagicon|China}} [[Burang County]] ([[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]])\n|Northeast =\n|East = [[Bajhang District]]\n|Southeast = \n|South = [[Baitadi District]]\n|Southwest = \n|West = {{flagicon|India}} [[Pithoragarh district]] ([[Uttrakhand]])\n|Northwest = \n}}\n{{Darchula District}}\n{{Districts of Nepal}}\n\n{{coord|29.848464|N|80.543391|E|type:adm3rd_source:itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{commons category|Darchula District}}\n\n[[Category:Darchula District|*]]\n[[Category:Nepal districts established in 1962]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| type                    = [[Districts of Nepal|District]]\n| name                    = Darchula District of nepal\n| native_name             = \u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091a\u0941\u0932\u093e \u091c\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\n| nickname                = \n| native_name_lang        = <!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"fr\" for French.

[[Api (mountain)|Api Himal]] ({{convert|7132|m|ft}}) and [[Jethi Bahurani]] ({{convert|6850|m|ft}}) are main mountain peaks of the area. There is a protected area named [[Api Nampa Conservation Area]] which ranges in elevation from {{convert|532|m|ft}} to {{convert|7132|m|ft}}. [[Mahakali river|Mahakali]], Chalune, Tinkar, Nampa and Kalagad are the rivers in the area.\n\nThe climate of the area is generally characterized by high rainfall and humidity. The climatic condition varies along with the elevation gradient. The climate of Darchula District varies widely from subtropical to alpine. In the north, most of the parts, having an alpine climate, remain under snow. In the southern part and valleys the climate is subtropical. Mid- hills have a temperate climate. The average maximum temperature is 18.6&nbsp;\u00b0C and the minimum temperature is 7.7&nbsp;\u00b0C. The average rainfall is 2129mm. Most precipitation falls between May and September.\nAbout eighty percent of the total annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season (June to September). All areas experience very high rainfall intensities, ranging between estimates of 125\u2013350&nbsp;mm for a 24-hour period.\nWithin its elevation range of 1800m to 6500m, there are limited subtropical valleys in the southern margin although most of the area is ecologically temperate or highland.

About 58.4 percent of the population falls below the poverty line. Population composition is made up of different castes, such as Kshatriya 63.55%, Brahmin 17.15%, Thakuri 4.01%, Dalit and others contribute 15.39 percent. Hindu followers are high in numbers. Hindu, Buddhists, as well as others, regard nature as a gift from God and they worship nature their own way.<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />\n\n===Ethnic composition===\nThe majority ethnic group is Pahari [[Aryan|Arya]].  Castes of Darchula District are Brahmin, Chhetries, Dalit, Thakuri, Lohar, Kaine, Newar, Byansi, Bandhe, Sanyasi etc. Among them 85.19% HHs are Brahmin/Chheties/Thakuri, 10% Dalits, 0.12% Sauka and others are occupational caste groups. Sauka are indigenous inhabitant's caste group. The indigenous caste groups are dominated by migrants from other villages.\nThe Dalits (7.35%) and Thakuri (7.43%) share equal proportions and occupy the second largest group in the total population. Indigenous groups Byansi represent 1.32%, Lohar 1.38% and other minorities\u2019 correspondent to 1.48 percent.  Dalits are also defined as the Special Target Groups (STGs).<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />\n\n===Language===\nAt the time of the [[2011 Nepal census]], Darchula District had a population of 133,274.

The major socioeconomic indicator of Darchula District is still very poor. Life expectancy of these people was about 52 in 1996. About 89.90% of the total population depends upon agriculture. Substance agriculture, lack of basic infrastructure, difficult geophysical condition, traditional agricultural practice, low literacy rate and population growth are the root causes for deeply rooted poverty.<ref name=\"National Population and Housing Census 2011(National Report)\" />\n\n==Trade and business==\nTrade is one of the most important means of livelihood. Every year, people from the hills come with NTFP, ghee, and herbs to sell. Agriculture related commodities are sold in local bazaars (markets). People of Byans, Rapla go to Tibet to fill their needs for clothes and other commodities. Local carpets and wool products, handmade clothes, and NTFP bring in huge amounts of money to the VDCs. However, each and every respondent indicated that their income is invested in domestic use.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Api Nampa Conservation Area]] is a famous gateway to Kailash Mansarobar's holy region located in Tibet. Many pilgrims pass through this Conservation Area to get to Kailash Pravat. Not only Nepalese but also foreigners visit Api Nampa Conservation Area to acquire satisfaction, spirituality and the boons of nature.\nThe first European, A. H. Savage Landor entered Nampa valley in 1899 and explored the glacier system. He travelled across the Tinkar valley and entered Tibet via the Lipu pass. In 1905, Dr. Longstaff visited this region. Then Swiss geologists A. Heim and A. Gansser visited the [[Api (mountain)|Api Himal]] area in 1936.\nThe elevation of Api Himal at the top is calculated to be 23,399&nbsp;ft. John Tyson and W. H. Murray explored this region in 1953. An Api group has been created to lure tourists wanting to see the geological features blending with nature and other natural assets. Sauka culture is also an attraction for tourist.\nApi Himal can be visited by going via Darchula Bazar, Huti, Sunsera, Rapla to base camp. It takes five days to reach there or travelers may go via Bitule, Makari Gad, Ghusa Village, Domilla, to Lolu at the base camp. Panoramic views of Himalayas are created by several peaks like Nampa, [[Jethi Bahurani]] and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Media/radio partners==\nTo Promote local culture there are few FM radio stations: Radio Samad FM 102.6 MHz,<ref>{{cite web|title= 50.Radio Samad FM 102.6&nbsp;MHz|url=http://www.acorab.org.np/index.php?pagename=memberDetail&memberId=83}}</ref> Radio Naya Nepal FM 104.5&nbsp;MHz,<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Naya Nepal FM 104.5&nbsp;MHz|url=http://www.nayanepalfm.com.np/}}</ref> Darchula FM, which are Community radio Stations.\n\n==Education==\n===Colleges and schools===\n*Darchula Multiple Campus\n*Gokuleshwar Higher Secondary School\n*Himalaya Higher Secondary School\n*Gokuleswar Multiple Campus \n*Sri Krishna Snatak Campus\n*Rastriya Campus\n*[[Mahendra Higher Secondary School]]\n*Shankarpur Higher Secondary School\n*Latinath Higher Secondary School\n*Srikrishana Higher Secondary School\n*Rastiya Higher Secondary School\n*Latinatha Higher Secondary School\n*Hunainath Secondary School Baaj (Mahara Village)\n*Hunainath Higher Secondary School\n*Janabikasa Higher Secondary School\n*Ganesh Binayak Higher Secondary School\n*Malikarjun Higher Secondary School\n*Krishana Higher Secondary School\n*Sarswati Higher Secondary School\n*Gurilamandu Higher Secondary School\n*Galainath Higher Secondary School\n*Satya Parkash Higher Secondary School\n*Sri Krishana Higher Secondary School\n*[[Apinampa Campus]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.un.org.np/sites/default/files/maps/district_maps/Darchula.pdf UN map of VDC boundaries, water features and roads in Darchula]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/DarchulaDistrict/ Darchula District On Facebook ]\n\n==See also==\n*{{statoids|id=ynp|title=Districts of Nepal}}\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre = Darchula\n|North = {{flagicon|China}} [[Burang County]] ([[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]])\n|Northeast =\n|East = [[Bajhang District]]\n|Southeast = \n|South = [[Baitadi District]]\n|Southwest = \n|West = {{flagicon|India}} [[Pithoragarh district]] ([[Uttrakhand]])\n|Northwest = \n}}\n{{Darchula District}}\n{{Districts of Nepal}}\n\n{{coord|29.848464|N|80.543391|E|type:adm3rd_source:itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{commons category|Darchula District}}\n\n[[Category:Darchula District|*]]\n[[Category:Nepal districts established in 1962]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo; mos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darchula_District"}

The album was recorded using money loaned to T.S.O.L. by the [[Dead Kennedys]], and found the new incarnation of the band moving away from the [[hardcore punk]] associations of the original lineup in favor of a traditional rock and [[gothic rock]] sound.

It was the band's first album with singer/guitarist Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, replacing founding members [[Jack Grisham]] and Todd Barnes who had left the band in late 1983. The album was recorded using money loaned to T.S.O.L. by the [[Dead Kennedys]], and found the new incarnation of the band moving away from the [[hardcore punk]] associations of the original lineup in favor of a traditional rock and [[gothic rock]] sound. ''Change Today?'' was reissued in 1999 through the Enigma subsidiary [[Restless Records]], adding four tracks from the recording sessions that had been left off the original album.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn their 1983 album ''[[Beneath the Shadows]]'', T.S.O.L. had moved away from [[hardcore punk]], adding [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] to their lineup and shifting in a [[gothic rock]] direction in in the vein of later releases by [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] (after their original punk releases) and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].<ref name=\"Torreano\">{{cite web |last=Torreano |first=Bradley |title=Biography: T.S.O.L. |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tsol-p14438/biography |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Blush, 94\">{{cite book| last=Blush |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Blush |title=[[American Hardcore: A Tribal History]] |publisher=[[Feral House]] |date=2001 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0-922915-71-7|page=94}}</ref> Though the album received positive reviews from critics, it was largely rejected by their hardcore fanbase.<ref name=\"Torreano\"/><ref name=\"Blush, 94\"/> In late 1983 singer [[Jack Grisham]], drummer Todd Barnes, and keyboardist Greg Kuehn all left the band.<ref name=\"Blush, 95-96\">Blush, pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Grisham cited increased violence and police presence at shows, as well as audiences looking to him for instruction, as factors in his departure.<ref name=\"Blush, 95\">Blush, p. 95.</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Ron Emory]] and bassist Mike Roche continued on as T.S.O.L., assembling a new lineup in February 1984 that included drummer Mitch Dean, formerly of The Joneses, and singer/guitarist Joe Wood (Wood later married Grisham's sister).<ref name=\"Blush, 95\"/><ref name=\"notes\"/> The [[Dead Kennedys]] loaned the group their van to tour the United States.<ref name=\"Torreano\"/> They began to write new material that reflected the growing British gothic rock genre they admired, coming up with 20\u201330 songs.<ref name=\"Torreano\"/><ref name=\"notes\"/> However, they faced a lack of interest from record labels in financing a recording session.<ref name=\"notes\"/> The Dead Kennedys again assisted the band, loaning them money for studio time.<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\nOver the course of four nights at Mad Dog Studio in [[Venice, California]] T.S.O.L. recorded their new songs with [[audio engineering|recording engineer]] Stuart Schanwetter and [[record producer|producer]] Chris Grayson.<ref name=\"notes\"/> The tracks were [[audio mastering|mastered]] by Eddy Schreyer, and the band chose ten to comprise ''Change Today?'', which was picked up for release by [[Enigma Records]].<ref name=\"Torreano\"/><ref name=\"notes\"/> The group toured constantly in the two months leading up to its release, playing nine of the album's ten songs in their set.<ref name=\"notes\"/> \"We would leave out 'Flowers by the Door{{' \"}}, recalled Dean, \"because we thought it was weak and it just barely made it onto the album.

He introduced new stylistic elements into the traditional Mewati style, following the romanticism started by [[Omkarnath Thakur]] and producing a more emotive, devotional, rhythmic-conscious, and lyric-conscious style.\n\n===Pedagogical genealogy===\nA visual representation of Mewati gharana and its earlier roots.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10689557_109712872693725_7531852658578182931_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=7385c37d33884b7f26c6f0ced6739c8c&oe=5C80BB2D | title=Mewati Gharana Lineage | accessdate=20 December 2018 }} {{unreliable?|date=December 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{familytree/start|style=font-size:85%;line-height:100%;}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | |GWALI| | |DELHI| | | | | | | | | |KIRAN| |DAGAR|GWALI=[[Gwalior gharana|''Gwalior Gharana<br>Guru Parampara'']]\n            |DELHI=[[Qawwal Bacchon gharana|''Qawwal Bacchon Gharana<br>Guru Parampara'']]\n            |KIRAN=[[Kirana gharana|''Kirana Gharana<br>Guru Parampara'']]\n            |DAGAR=[[Dagar gharana|''Dagar Gharana<br>Guru Parampara'']]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | |:| | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | |HADDU| | | |:| | | | | | | | | | |SADIQ| |BEHRA|HADDU=[[Haddu Khan|Haddu Khan<br>(Gwalior)]]\n            |SADIQ=[[Kirana gharana|Sadiq Ali Khan<br>(Kirana)]]\n            |BEHRA=[[Dagar gharana|Behram Khan<br>(Dagarbani)]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |F|~|A|7| | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |:| |DAUGH| |BADEM| | | | | | | | | | |L|~|V|~|J|DAUGH=[[Haddu Khan|(Daughter)]]\n            |BADEM=[[Bade Mohammed Khan|Bade Mohammed<br>Khan (Rewa)]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | |CHOTE| |L|~|V|~|J| | | | | | | | | | | | |BANDE|CHOTE=[[Chote Mohammed Khan|Chote Mohammed<br>Khan (son)]]\n            |BANDE=[[Bande Ali Khan|Bande Ali Khan<br>(beenkar)]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |:| | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |:| | | |WARIS| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:||WARIS=[[Waris Ali Khan|Waris Ali Khan<br>(son)]]\n            |MURAD=[[Murad Ali Khan|Murad Ali Khan<br>(son)]]\n            |MUNNA=[[Munnawar Ali Khan|Munnawar Ali Khan<br>(son)]]\n            |KUTUB=[[Kutub Ali Khan|Kutub Ali Khan<br>(son)]]\n            |MUBAR=Mubarak Ali Khan<br>(son, Jaipur Court)}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |L|~|~|V|~|J| | | | | | | | | | | | | |WAHID|WAHID=[[Mewati gharana#Utd.
