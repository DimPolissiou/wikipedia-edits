His most popular songs are the number-one hits \"[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)]]\" and \"[[Take This Job and Shove It]]\".

Coe claimed he received encouragement to begin writing songs from [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], with whom he had spent time in prison.<ref name=Leroy />\n\nAfter concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the [[Ryman Auditorium]]. He caught the attention of the independent record label [[Plantation Records]] and signed a contract with the label.<ref name=Brennan>{{cite book |author=Sandra Brennan |others=[[Michael Erlewine]] | title=All Music Guide to Country |isbn=0-87930-475-8 |pages=95\u201396 }}</ref>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Early career (1970\u20131975) ===\n\nEarly in 1970, Coe released his debut album, ''[[Penitentiary Blues]]'', followed by a tour with [[Grand Funk Railroad]].<ref name=Brennan /> In October 1971, he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drake's publishing company Windows Publishing Company, Inc. in Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained until 1977. Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including [[Billie Jo Spears]]' 1972 recording \"Souvenirs & California Mem'rys\" and [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 1973 single \"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone),\" which was a number-one hit, and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville's hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Brennan /> Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'', released in 1975.<ref name=AllmusicRhyme /> [[AllMusic]] writer Thom Jurek said of the song, \"The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive.\"<ref name=AllmusicRhyme>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/once-upon-a-rhyme-r105958/review |title=Once Upon a Rhyme \u2013 David Allan Coe |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Unlike Coe's first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as [[outlaw country]].  The title of Coe's debut album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before [[Glen Campbell]] had a hit with the song \"[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]\": dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a lone ranger mask.  The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, \"I guess I have to blame it on [[Mel Tillis]]. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on [[Music Row]]. I was over there talking to him in his office and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that. He looked at me and said \u2018You like that shit, I don't even wear those, if you want \u2018em take \u2018em!' He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhere.<ref name=\"swampland\">{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:david_allan_coe|title=The Original Outlaw: David Allan Coe|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=June 2004|work=Swampland.com|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>  Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father:\n\n{{quote| Then I got the mysterious rhinestone thing from my father.  He asked me,\"You know the only way that [[The Lone Ranger]] can go into town? I said, \"No, I don't know what you mean.\" He said that he has to take his mask off. I thought, what is my dad talking about and trying to tell me? He said, \"Well son, you have to wear a mask and then when you don't want to be David Allan Coe you can take your mask off and go anywhere and not be like [[Elvis]] with people messin' with you all the time.\"<ref name=\"swampland\"/>}}\n\nCoe's second LP ''Once Upon a Rhyme'' contains one of his biggest hits, \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]],\" written by [[Steve Goodman]] and [[John Prine]] and first appeared on Goodman's 1971 debut.  Coe's version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at #8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the \"perfect country and western song.\" Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of [[clich\u00e9]]s: \"Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk\". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the \"perfect country and western song\" and included the last verse on the record:\n\n<blockquote>''I was drunk the day Mama got out of prison<br/>And I went to pick 'er up in the rain<br/>But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck<br/>She got runned over by a damned ol' train''</blockquote>\n\nCoe was a featured performer in ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'', a 1975 documentary film by [[James Szalapski]]. Other performers featured in this film included [[Guy Clark]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Steve Earle]], and the [[Charlie Daniels]] Band.  Coe also wrote \"Cocaine Carolina\" for [[Johnny Cash]] and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cash's 1975 LP ''[[John R. Cash]]''.\n\n=== Outlaw years (1976\u20131982) ===\n\nBy 1976 the [[outlaw country]] movement was in full swing as artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way.  Coe, however, was still somewhat of an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic:\n\n{{quote|His wild, long hair; multiple earrings; flashy, glitzy rhinestone suits; Harley Davidson biker boots; and football-sized belt buckles had become obstacles to getting people to take him seriously as a recording artist. Other singers continued to record and succeed with his material, but the author himself \u2013 who was as good a singer as almost anyone and better than most \u2013 languished in obscurity. Rather than tone it down, Coe characteristically shoved the stereotypes in their faces. He retired the Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy persona and billed his new album as \"David Allan Coe Rides Again as the Longhaired Redneck,\" something equally off-putting to institution types.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n''Longhaired Redneck'' was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs, and the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive \"where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive.\"  The song, which has an unmistakable rock swagger, features Coe performing an impressive imitation of [[Ernest Tubb]], making it irretrievably country as well, illustrating the dichotomy of what was being referred to as \"progressive\" country music.  Coe later explained, \"It was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it.'\"<ref name=\"review-mag\">{{cite web|url=https://www.review-mag.com/archive/570-579/577/Ncoeinterview.htm|title= An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristofer|date=January 2003|work=Review|accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of [[Willie Nelson]]'s blockbuster LP ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' and ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', country music's first platinum selling album.  Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in [[AllMusic]]'s review of the album, \"On ''[[Rides Again (David Allen Coe album)|Rides Again]]'', by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, 'Willie, Waylon, and Me'... Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally \u2013 something that continued to curse him.\"<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  The songs on ''Rides Again'' crossfade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily phased guitar.  Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time.  Some of his peers, however,  resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=157}}  Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe \"a great, great songwriter.  A great singer.  But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up.  Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did.  I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time.  Willie allowed him to hang around.\"{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=156-157}}  Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Waylon and Willie, despite Jennings's cool treatment of him at times. In his autobiography, Jennings mentions Coe once (in a chapter titled \"The Outlaw Shit\"), calling him \"the most sincere of the bunch\"{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}} of bandwagon jumpers, but contends \"When it came to being an Outlaw, the worst thing he ever did was double parking on Music Row,\"{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}} adding:\n\n{{quote|He wrote a song called \"Waylon, Willie, and Me\" at the same time he started taking potshots at us in interviews, saying that Willie and Kris [Kristofferson] had sold out, that I was running around wearing white buck shoes, and none of us were really an Outlaw.  He was the only Outlaw in [[Nashville]]\u2026I saw him in Fort Worth and I put my finger right up to his chest.  \"You gotta knock that shit off,\" I told him.  \"I ain't never done anything to you.\"  \"They just set us up,\" he protested.  \"You know I love you, Waylon\"\u2026He could drive me crazy, but there was something about David that pulled at my heartstrings.{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}}}}\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, like ''Human Emotions'' (1978) and ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' (1979), were concept albums with each side of the LPs given their own theme.  1978's ''[[Family Album (David Allan Coe album)|Family Album]]'' contains Coe's rendition of \"Take This Job and Shove It,\" a song he composed which had been released by [[Johnny Paycheck]] in October 1977 and became a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name.  Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused him of plagiarising his hit \"[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]\" for Coe's \"Divers Do It Deeper.\"  (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album ''[[Compass Point (David Allan Coe album)|Compass Point]]''.)  By 1980, Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become ''I've Got Something to Say'', which would boast contributions from [[Guy Clark]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Dickey Betts]] (from [[The Allman Brothers Band]]), [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Larry Jon Wilson]], and [[George Jones]].  This process was continued the following year on ''Invictus (Means) Unconquered'', with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice.  (In his [[AllMusic]] review, Thom Jurek calls the LP \"arguably the finest album of his career\")<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>   By 1981, the [[outlaw country]] movement waned as the slicker \"urban cowboy\" era took hold in country music, typified by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]]'s hit \"Lookin' for Love,\" which critic Kurt Wolff panned the song as an example of \"watered-down cowboy music.\"<ref>Wolff, Kurt, \"Country Music: The Rough Guide,\" Rough Guides Ltd., London; Penguin Putnam, New York, distributor. p. 424 ({{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}})</ref> Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase.  Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country \"talent,\" Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive.  Coe's highest charting single during this period was \"Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands,\" a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at #45.  As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album ''[[D.A.C.]]'' with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue:\n\n{{quote|\"Makin' records is, uh, somethin' that's kind of hard for me to do because I'm an entertainer.  So I made my mind up a few albums ago that I was gonna do so many songs for the record company and so many for myself...We've turned the lights down low in the studio and the musicians have thrown away their little cheat sheets.  So this is for all you David Allan Coe fans that's been with me for a long time who  didn't really care if I got played on the radio or not.\"}}\n\n=== Commercial success (1983\u20131989) ===\n\n''Castles in the Sand'' would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at #8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since ''Once Upon a Rhyme'' hit the same mark eight years earlier.  Its success was spurred on by \"The Ride,\" which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and spent 19 weeks on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, reaching a peak of #4 and hitting #2 on the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart.  The [[ballad (music)|ballad]] tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker's encounter with the ghost of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams, Sr.]] in a ride from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"billboard\">''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', March 19, 1983</ref> The mysterious driver, \"dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed\", questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the [[country music]] industry. The song's lyrics place the events on [[U.S. Route 31]] or the largely parallel [[Interstate 65]].  Buoyed by the single, ''Castles in the Sand'' became the mainstream breakthrough Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had been trying for since the decade began.  1984's ''Just Divorced'' contains Coe's biggest chart hit, \"[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]],\" which rose to #2 on the country singles chart in early 1984.  In Canada, it reached Number One on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6782&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=5k2habs6oq2oo3qhbu41reev74 |title=RPM Country Tracks for June 30, 1984 |work=RPM |accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>  The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the [[Mona Lisa|iconic Da Vinci painting]].  The song features one of producer [[Billy Sherrill]]'s most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, \"The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe's voice that it works to devastating effect.\"<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  Another hit, \"[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]\" was released in December 1984 and peaked at # 11 on both the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by [[Johnny Cash]] was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/johnny-cashs-lost-love-song-20140113|title=Johnny Cash's Lost Love Song|publisher=Rolling Stone|last=Sullivan|first=James|accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>  The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at \"the Silver Spoon Caf\u00e9,\" but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him the in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by [[Dennis Morgan (songwriter)|Dennis Morgan]], Charles Quillen, and [[Kye Fleming]], as Coe, who continued to write songs of high quality, nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts.  The 1986 album ''[[Son of the South (David Allan Coe album)|Son of the South]]'' would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and [[Jessie Colter]].  His final recording for Columbia, the concept album ''A Matter of Life\u2026and Death'', was released in 1987.\n\n=== Later career (1990 \u2013 present) ===\n\nIn 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' on compact disc, as well as the compilation ''18 X-Rated Hits''.<ref name=Netherland/> Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe.<ref name=Brennan/> In 1999, Coe met [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], agreed to work together, and began production on an album.<ref name=Leroy/><ref name=Legett/>  In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for [[Kid Rock]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article by journalist [[Neil Strauss]], who described the material on ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' as \"among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter.\"<ref name=Strauss>{{cite news |title=Songwriter's Racist Songs From 1980's Haunt Him |author=Neil Strauss |date=September 4, 2000 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/arts/songwriter-s-racist-songs-from-1980-s-haunt-him.html |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>  Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe's manager refused to speak on the record.<ref name=Netherland/><ref name=Strauss/>  In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, \"Single Father\", which appeared on Kid Rock's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled album]], and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|Country Singles chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kid Rock \u2013 ''Kid Rock'' \u2013 ''Billboard'' Singles |date=October 5, 2011 |website=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kid-rock-r663144/charts-awards/billboard-single}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Are ya ready for some country?

Coe's integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he'd spent time on [[death row]] for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials, never murder.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=155}}  Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, explaining in 2003:\n\n{{quote|\u2026the truth is that Waylon and Willie Nelson and I played at an outdoor festival called ''48 Hours in Atoka'', in Oklahoma...When we got there...several women were raped and people stabbed!  There was a lot of alcohol and drugs or whatever. I told my band, \"Don't worry about it. We'll provide our own protection.\"  At that time I was in the Outlaws Motorcycle Club. I had my Outlaws' colors on, and I had my pistol in my pocket and I rode my motorcycle up on stage while Waylon was singing. I got off my motorcycle and went out and started singing with Waylon. And then Willie came out and sang with us. There was a picture of us in the paper that had an arrow pointing to the pistol in my pocket and another arrow pointing to where it said, \"Outlaws, Florida.\" The headline said, \"The Outlaws came to town.\" That's actually how it all started.<ref  name=\"review-mag\"/>}}   Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows.  \"The House We've Been Calling Home,\" from the 1977 LP ''Rides Again'', for example, explores the theme of polygamy (\"Me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling a home...\"), while on the final cut on the album, \"If That Ain't Country (I\u2019ll Kiss Your Ass),\" Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line \"Workin' like a nigger for my room and board.\"  The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as \"veteran proud\" and deeming his oldest sister \"a first-rate whore.\"  The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied.  In 2004 he remarked:\n\n{{quote|I am a songwriter, you know, and to me it has always bothered me that actors in the movies can say whatever they want to say, kill people, rape people and do things and no one ever  accuses them personally of being that way. But when you write a song and then all of a sudden you are being accused of something. To me, songwriting is painting a picture and all you have to work with is words\u2026 I grew up with all my life hearing, \"lazy as a Mexican,\" \"stingy as a Jew,\" \"working like a nigger,\" or \"dumb as a Polock.\" It's stereotype stuff that you hear growing up that immediately puts a picture in your head.<ref name=\"swampland\"/>}}\n\nThe cover of 1986's ''Son of the South'', which displayed Coe holding a baby with a [[Confederate flag]] draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to diffuse any potential backlash:\n\n{{quote|I was born in [[Akron]], Ohio, and I moved to the South when I was in my early twenties which made me a \"[[yankee]]\" rebel son. I am not against anything or any place or any nationalities.  Regardless of what you've heard about me, there are two things I am very proud of.  One of them is my son Tyler who is my first born son.  And the other is my personal relationship with God.  I am proud of that relationship as I am proud that my son was conceived in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and he is truly a song of the south.}}\n\nIn another interview Coe stated, \"Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people and I hung around with black people and learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a \"nigger lover\" and now I write the word \"nigger\" in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic.\"<ref name=\"swampland\"/>\n\n=== Underground albums ===\n\nWhile Coe lived in Key West, [[Shel Silverstein]] played his comedy album ''[[Freakin' at the Freakers Ball]]'' for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released ''[[Nothing Sacred (David Allan Coe album)|Nothing Sacred]]''.<ref name=Netherland /> [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of \"Divers Do It Deeper\" from Buffett's \"[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]\", stating, \"I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.\"<ref name=Eng>{{cite book |author=Steve Eng |title=Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Margaritaville Revealed |isbn=0-312-16875-6 |page=217 |chapter=Hello, Textas\u2014Hello, St. Barts (and Montserrat) }}</ref> In response to the success of Buffett's song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine ''[[Easyriders]]''.<ref name=Netherland>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=360 |title=David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge |author=Tom Netherland |date=November 2000 |work= |publisher=Country Standard Time |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> Coe's 1979 Columbia album ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' contained a note stating \"[[Jimmy Buffett]] doesn't live in [[Key West]] anymore,\" a lyric from a song from ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng />  The lyrics of ''Nothing Sacred'' are profane, often sexually explicit and describe an orgy in Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]] and sex with [[pornographic film]] star [[Linda Lovelace]]. The album also contains a song targeting [[Anita Bryant]], a musician notable for her strong [[LGBT rights opposition|opposition to LGBT rights]], specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT [[anti-discrimination]] ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County]]. In the song, bluntly titled \"Fuck Aneta Briant\" {{sic}}, Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that \"In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you\".<ref name=Eng/><ref name=Washburne>{{cite book |others=Christopher Washburne, Maiken Derno |title=Bad music: the music we love to hate |isbn=0-415-94366-3 |page=37 |chapter=White trash alchemies of the abject sublime }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Coe released another independent album, ''[[Underground Album]]'', which contained his most controversial song, \"Nigger Fucker\", which resulted in Coe being accused of racism.<ref name=Washburne /><ref>{{cite book |title=Dixie Lullaby: A Story of Music, Race, and New Beginnings in a New South |author=Mark Kemp|isbn=0-8203-2872-3 |page=204 }}</ref> Primarily because of this song, the material recorded by singer and [[white supremacist]] [[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]] is mistakenly attributed to Coe.

Coe claimed he received encouragement to begin writing songs from [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], with whom he had spent time in prison.<ref name=Leroy />\n\nAfter concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the [[Ryman Auditorium]].

Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including [[Billie Jo Spears]]' 1972 recording \"Souvenirs & California Mem'rys\" and [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 1973 single \"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone),\" which was a number-one hit, and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville's hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Brennan /> Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'', released in 1975.<ref name=AllmusicRhyme /> [[AllMusic]] writer Thom Jurek said of the song, \"The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive.\"<ref name=AllmusicRhyme>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/once-upon-a-rhyme-r105958/review |title=Once Upon a Rhyme \u2013 David Allan Coe |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Unlike Coe's first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as [[outlaw country]].  The title of Coe's debut album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before [[Glen Campbell]] had a hit with the song \"[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]\": dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a lone ranger mask.  The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, \"I guess I have to blame it on [[Mel Tillis]]. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on [[Music Row]]. I was over there talking to him in his office and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that.

Coe's version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at #8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the \"perfect country and western song.\" Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of [[clich\u00e9]]s: \"Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk\". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the \"perfect country and western song\" and included the last verse on the record:\n\n<blockquote>''I was drunk the day Mama got out of prison<br/>And I went to pick 'er up in the rain<br/>But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck<br/>She got runned over by a damned ol' train''</blockquote>\n\nCoe was a featured performer in ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'', a 1975 documentary film by [[James Szalapski]]. Other performers featured in this film included [[Guy Clark]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Steve Earle]], and the [[Charlie Daniels]] Band.

Coe, however, was still somewhat of an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic:\n\n{{quote|His wild, long hair; multiple earrings; flashy, glitzy rhinestone suits; Harley Davidson biker boots; and football-sized belt buckles had become obstacles to getting people to take him seriously as a recording artist. Other singers continued to record and succeed with his material, but the author himself \u2013 who was as good a singer as almost anyone and better than most \u2013 languished in obscurity. Rather than tone it down, Coe characteristically shoved the stereotypes in their faces. He retired the Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy persona and billed his new album as \"David Allan Coe Rides Again as the Longhaired Redneck,\" something equally off-putting to institution types.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n''Longhaired Redneck'' was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs, and the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive \"where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive.\"  The song, which has an unmistakable rock swagger, features Coe performing an impressive imitation of [[Ernest Tubb]], making it irretrievably country as well, illustrating the dichotomy of what was being referred to as \"progressive\" country music.  Coe later explained, \"It was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it.'\"<ref name=\"review-mag\">{{cite web|url=https://www.review-mag.com/archive/570-579/577/Ncoeinterview.htm|title= An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristofer|date=January 2003|work=Review|accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of [[Willie Nelson]]'s blockbuster LP ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' and ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', country music's first platinum selling album.  Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in [[AllMusic]]'s review of the album, \"On ''[[Rides Again (David Allen Coe album)|Rides Again]]'', by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, 'Willie, Waylon, and Me'... Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally \u2013 something that continued to curse him.\"<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  The songs on ''Rides Again'' crossfade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily phased guitar.  Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time.  Some of his peers, however,  resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=157}}  Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe \"a great, great songwriter.  A great singer.  But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up.  Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did.  I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time.  Willie allowed him to hang around.\"{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=156-157}}  Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Waylon and Willie, despite Jennings's cool treatment of him at times. In his autobiography, Jennings mentions Coe once (in a chapter titled \"The Outlaw Shit\"), calling him \"the most sincere of the bunch\"{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}} of bandwagon jumpers, but contends \"When it came to being an Outlaw, the worst thing he ever did was double parking on Music Row,\"{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}} adding:  \n\n{{quote|He wrote a song called \"Waylon, Willie, and Me\" at the same time he started taking potshots at us in interviews, saying that Willie and Kris [Kristofferson] had sold out, that I was running around wearing white buck shoes, and none of us were really an Outlaw.  He was the only Outlaw in [[Nashville]]\u2026I saw him in Fort Worth and I put my finger right up to his chest.  \"You gotta knock that shit off,\" I told him.  \"I ain't never done anything to you.\"  \"They just set us up,\" he protested.  \"You know I love you, Waylon\"\u2026He could drive me crazy, but there was something about David that pulled at my heartstrings.{{sfn|Jennings, Waylon, Kaye, Lenny|1996|p=231-233}}}}\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, like ''Human Emotions'' (1978) and ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' (1979), were concept albums with each side of the LPs given their own theme.  1978's ''[[Family Album (David Allan Coe album)|Family Album]]'' contains Coe's rendition of \"Take This Job and Shove It,\" a song he composed which had been released by [[Johnny Paycheck]] in October 1977 and became a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name.  Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused him of plagiarising his hit \"[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]\" for Coe's \"Divers Do It Deeper.\"  (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album ''[[Compass Point (David Allan Coe album)|Compass Point]]''.)  By 1980, Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become ''I've Got Something to Say'', which would boast contributions from [[Guy Clark]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Dickey Betts]] (from [[The Allman Brothers Band]]), [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Larry Jon Wilson]], and [[George Jones]].  This process was continued the following year on ''Invictus (Means) Unconquered'', with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice.  (In his [[AllMusic]] review, Thom Jurek calls the LP \"arguably the finest album of his career\")<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>   By 1981, the [[outlaw country]] movement waned as the slicker \"urban cowboy\" era took hold in country music, typified by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]]'s hit \"Lookin' for Love,\" which critic Kurt Wolff panned the song as an example of \"watered-down cowboy music.\"<ref>Wolff, Kurt, \"Country Music: The Rough Guide,\" Rough Guides Ltd., London; Penguin Putnam, New York, distributor. p. 424 ({{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}})</ref> Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase.  Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country \"talent,\" Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive.  Coe's highest charting single during this period was \"Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands,\" a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at #45.  As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album ''[[D.A.C.]]'' with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue:\n\n{{quote|\"Makin' records is, uh, somethin' that's kind of hard for me to do because I'm an entertainer.  So I made my mind up a few albums ago that I was gonna do so many songs for the record company and so many for myself...We've turned the lights down low in the studio and the musicians have thrown away their little cheat sheets.  So this is for all you David Allan Coe fans that's been with me for a long time who  didn't really care if I got played on the radio or not.\"}}\n\n=== Commercial success (1983\u20131989) ===\n\n''Castles in the Sand'' would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at #8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since ''Once Upon a Rhyme'' hit the same mark eight years earlier.  Its success was spurred on by \"The Ride,\" which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and spent 19 weeks on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, reaching a peak of #4 and hitting #2 on the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart.  The [[ballad (music)|ballad]] tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker's encounter with the ghost of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams, Sr.]] in a ride from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"billboard\">''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', March 19, 1983</ref> The mysterious driver, \"dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed\", questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the [[country music]] industry. The song's lyrics place the events on [[U.S. Route 31]] or the largely parallel [[Interstate 65]].  Buoyed by the single, ''Castles in the Sand'' became the mainstream breakthrough Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had been trying for since the decade began.  1984's ''Just Divorced'' contains Coe's biggest chart hit, \"[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]],\" which rose to #2 on the country singles chart in early 1984.  In Canada, it reached Number One on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6782&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=5k2habs6oq2oo3qhbu41reev74 |title=RPM Country Tracks for June 30, 1984 |work=RPM |accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>  The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the [[Mona Lisa|iconic Da Vinci painting]].  The song features one of producer [[Billy Sherrill]]'s most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, \"The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe's voice that it works to devastating effect.\"<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  Another hit, \"[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]\" was released in December 1984 and peaked at # 11 on both the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by [[Johnny Cash]] was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/johnny-cashs-lost-love-song-20140113|title=Johnny Cash's Lost Love Song|publisher=Rolling Stone|last=Sullivan|first=James|accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>  The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at \"the Silver Spoon Caf\u00e9,\" but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him the in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by [[Dennis Morgan (songwriter)|Dennis Morgan]], Charles Quillen, and [[Kye Fleming]], as Coe, who continued to write songs of high quality, nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts.  The 1986 album ''[[Son of the South (David Allan Coe album)|Son of the South]]'' would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and [[Jessie Colter]].  His final recording for Columbia, the concept album ''A Matter of Life\u2026and Death'', was released in 1987.\n\n=== Later career (1990 \u2013 present) ===\n\nIn 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' on compact disc, as well as the compilation ''18 X-Rated Hits''.<ref name=Netherland/> Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe.<ref name=Brennan/> In 1999, Coe met [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], agreed to work together, and began production on an album.<ref name=Leroy/><ref name=Legett/>  In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for [[Kid Rock]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article by journalist [[Neil Strauss]], who described the material on ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' as \"among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter.\"<ref name=Strauss>{{cite news |title=Songwriter's Racist Songs From 1980's Haunt Him |author=Neil Strauss |date=September 4, 2000 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/arts/songwriter-s-racist-songs-from-1980-s-haunt-him.html |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>  Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe's manager refused to speak on the record.<ref name=Netherland/><ref name=Strauss/>  In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, \"Single Father\", which appeared on Kid Rock's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled album]], and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|Country Singles chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kid Rock \u2013 ''Kid Rock'' \u2013 ''Billboard'' Singles |date=October 5, 2011 |website=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kid-rock-r663144/charts-awards/billboard-single}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Are ya ready for some country?

Coe's integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he'd spent time on [[death row]] for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials, never murder.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=155}}  Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, explaining in 2003:\n\n{{quote|\u2026the truth is that Waylon and Willie Nelson and I played at an outdoor festival called ''48 Hours in Atoka'', in Oklahoma...When we got there...several women were raped and people stabbed!  There was a lot of alcohol and drugs or whatever. I told my band, \"Don't worry about it. We'll provide our own protection.\"  At that time I was in the Outlaws Motorcycle Club. I had my Outlaws' colors on, and I had my pistol in my pocket and I rode my motorcycle up on stage while Waylon was singing. I got off my motorcycle and went out and started singing with Waylon. And then Willie came out and sang with us. There was a picture of us in the paper that had an arrow pointing to the pistol in my pocket and another arrow pointing to where it said, \"Outlaws, Florida.\" The headline said, \"The Outlaws came to town.\" That's actually how it all started.<ref  name=\"review-mag\"/>}}   Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows.  \"The House We've Been Calling Home,\" from the 1977 LP ''Rides Again'', for example, explores the theme of polygamy (\"Me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling a home...\"), while on the final cut on the album, \"If That Ain't Country (I\u2019ll Kiss Your Ass),\" Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line \"Workin' like a nigger for my room and board.\"  The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as \"veteran proud\" and deeming his oldest sister \"a first-rate whore.\"  The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied.  In 2004 he remarked:\n\n{{quote|I am a songwriter, you know, and to me it has always bothered me that actors in the movies can say whatever they want to say, kill people, rape people and do things and no one ever  accuses them personally of being that way. But when you write a song and then all of a sudden you are being accused of something. To me, songwriting is painting a picture and all you have to work with is words\u2026 I grew up with all my life hearing, \"lazy as a Mexican,\" \"stingy as a Jew,\" \"working like a nigger,\" or \"dumb as a Polock.\" It's stereotype stuff that you hear growing up that immediately puts a picture in your head.<ref name=\"swampland\"/>}}\n\nThe cover of 1986's ''Son of the South'', which displayed Coe holding a baby with a [[Confederate flag]] draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to diffuse any potential backlash:\n\n{{quote|I was born in [[Akron]], Ohio, and I moved to the South when I was in my early twenties which made me a \"[[yankee]]\" rebel son. I am not against anything or any place or any nationalities.  Regardless of what you've heard about me, there are two things I am very proud of.  One of them is my son Tyler who is my first born son.  And the other is my personal relationship with God.  I am proud of that relationship as I am proud that my son was conceived in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and he is truly a song of the south.}} \n\nIn another interview Coe stated, \"Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people and I hung around with black people and learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a \"nigger lover\" and now I write the word \"nigger\" in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic.\"<ref name=\"swampland\"/>\n\n=== Undergound albums ===\n\nWhile Coe lived in Key West, [[Shel Silverstein]] played his comedy album ''[[Freakin' at the Freakers Ball]]'' for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released ''[[Nothing Sacred (David Allan Coe album)|Nothing Sacred]]''.<ref name=Netherland /> [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of \"Divers Do It Deeper\" from Buffett's \"[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]\", stating, \"I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.\"<ref name=Eng>{{cite book |author=Steve Eng |title=Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Margaritaville Revealed |isbn=0-312-16875-6 |page=217 |chapter=Hello, Textas\u2014Hello, St. Barts (and Montserrat) }}</ref> In response to the success of Buffett's song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine ''[[Easyriders]]''.<ref name=Netherland>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=360 |title=David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge |author=Tom Netherland |date=November 2000 |work= |publisher=Country Standard Time |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> Coe's 1979 Columbia album ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' contained a note stating \"[[Jimmy Buffett]] doesn't live in [[Key West]] anymore,\" a lyric from a song from ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng />  The lyrics of ''Nothing Sacred'' are profane, often sexually explicit and describe an orgy in Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]] and sex with [[pornographic film]] star [[Linda Lovelace]].

{"title_page": "Completeness of the real numbers", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Completeness (logic)}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=August 2019}}\nIntuitively, completeness implies that there are not any \u201cgaps\u201d (in Dedekind's terminology) or \u201cmissing points\u201d in the [[Real line|real number line]].  This contrasts with the [[rational number]]s, whose corresponding number line has a \u201cgap\u201d at each [[irrational number|irrational]] value.  In the [[Decimal|decimal number system]], completeness is equivalent to the statement that any infinite string of decimal digits is actually a [[decimal representation]] for some real number.\n\nDepending on the construction of the real numbers used, completeness may take the form of an [[axiom]] (the '''completeness axiom'''), or may be a [[theorem]] proven from the construction.  There are many [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] forms of completeness, the most prominent being '''Dedekind completeness''' and '''Cauchy completeness''' ([[Complete metric space|completeness as a metric space]]).\n\n==Forms of completeness==\nThe [[real number]]s can be [[Construction of the real numbers#Synthetic approach|defined synthetically]] as an [[ordered field]] satisfying some version of the [[completeness axiom]].  Different versions of this axiom are all equivalent in the sense that any ordered field that satisfies one form of completeness satisfies all of them, apart from Cauchy completeness and nested intervals theorem, which are strictly weaker in that there are non [[Archimedean property|Archimedean fields]] that are ordered and Cauchy complete.  When the real numbers are instead constructed using a model, completeness becomes a [[theorem]] or collection of theorems.\n\n===Least upper bound property===\n{{main|Least-upper-bound property}}\nThe '''least-upper-bound property''' states that every [[nonempty]] subset of real numbers having an [[upper bound]] must have a [[least upper bound]] (or supremum) in the set of real numbers.\n\nThe [[rational number|rational number line]] '''Q''' does not have the least upper bound property.  An example is the subset of rational numbers\n:<math>S = \\{ x\\in \\mathbf{Q}|x^2 < 2\\}.</math>\nThis set has an upper bound.  However, this set has no least upper bound in '''Q''': the least upper bound as a subset of the reals would be <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, but it does not exist in '''Q''' .\nFor any upper bound ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''Q''', there is another upper bound ''y''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''Q''' with ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''.\n\nFor instance, take <math> x = 1.4 </math>, then <math> x </math> is in our set <math> S </math>, and <math> x^2 = 1.96 </math> is certainly greater than or equal to all members of <math> S </math> and yet, we could still easily choose <math> y = 1.39, y^2 = 1.9321 </math> or <math> z = 1.38765, z^2 = 1.92433474 </math> or <math> ... g, g^2 ... </math>  Etc.\n\nAnd ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and so on could all be members of our set <math> S </math> and <math> x^2 > y^2 > z^2 > ... > g^2 > ... </math> so we have an infinite number of possible upper bounds, each less than the previous.  Which means there is no least upper bound for <math> S </math>.\n\nThe least upper bound property can be generalized to the setting of [[partially ordered set]]s.  See [[completeness (order theory)]].\n\n===Dedekind completeness===\n\n: ''See [[Dedekind completeness]] for more general concepts bearing this name.''\n\nDedekind completeness is the property that every [[Dedekind cut]] of the real numbers is generated by a real number. In a synthetic approach to the real numbers, this is the version of completeness that is most often included as an axiom.\n\nThe [[rational number|rational number line]] '''Q''' is not Dedekind complete. An example is the Dedekind cut\n:<math>L = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf{Q}|x^2 \\le 2 \\vee x < 0\\}.</math>\n:<math>R = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf{Q}|x^2 \\ge 2 \\wedge x > 0 \\}.</math>\n''L'' does not have a maximum and ''R'' does not have a minimum, so this cut is not generated by a rational number.\n\nThere is a [[Construction of the real numbers#Construction by Dedekind cuts|construction of the real numbers]] based on the idea of using Dedekind cuts of rational numbers to name real numbers; e.g. the cut ''(L,R)'' described above would name <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>. If one were to repeat the construction of real numbers with Dedekind cuts (i.e., \"close\" the set of real numbers by adding all possible Dedekind cuts), one would obtain no additional numbers because the real numbers are already Dedekind complete.\n\n===Cauchy completeness===\n'''Cauchy completeness''' is the statement that every [[Cauchy sequence]] of real numbers [[convergent sequences|converges]].\n\nThe [[rational number|rational number line]] '''Q''' is not Cauchy complete.  An example is the following sequence of rational numbers:\n:<math>3,\\quad 3.1,\\quad 3.14,\\quad 3.142,\\quad 3.1416,\\quad \\ldots</math>\nHere the ''n''th term in the sequence is the ''n''th decimal approximation for [[pi]].  Though this is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, it does not converge to any rational number.  (In this real number line, this sequence converges to pi.)\n\nCauchy completeness is related to the construction of the real numbers using Cauchy sequences.  Essentially, this method defines a real number to be the limit of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers.\n\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], Cauchy completeness can be generalized to a notion of completeness for any [[metric space]].  See [[complete metric space]].\n\nFor an [[ordered field]], Cauchy completeness is weaker than the other forms of completeness on this page. But Cauchy completeness and the [[Archimedean property]] taken together are equivalent to the others.\n\n===Nested intervals theorem===\n{{main|Nested intervals}}\nThe '''nested interval theorem''' is another form of completeness.  Let {{math|''I<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} [''a<sub>n</sub>'', ''b<sub>n</sub>'']}} be a sequence of closed [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], and suppose that these intervals are nested in the sense that\n:<math> I_1 \\;\\supset\\; I_2 \\;\\supset\\; I_3 \\;\\supset\\; \\cdots </math>\nMoreover, assume that {{math|''b<sub>n</sub>-a<sub>n</sub> \u2192 0''}} as {{math|''n \u2192 +\u221e''}}. The nested interval theorem states that the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all of the intervals {{math|''I<sub>n</sub>''}} contains exactly one point.\n\nThe [[rational number|rational number line]] does not satisfy the nested interval theorem.  For example, the sequence (whose terms are derived from the digits of [[pi]] in the suggested way)\n:<math>[3,4] \\;\\supset\\; [3.1,3.2] \\;\\supset\\; [3.14,3.15] \\;\\supset\\; [3.141,3.142] \\;\\supset\\; \\cdots </math>\nis a nested sequence of closed intervals in the rational numbers whose intersection is empty.  (In the real numbers, the intersection of these intervals contains the number [[pi]].)\n\nNested intervals theorem shares the same logical status as Cauchy completeness in this spectrum of expressions of completeness. In other words, nested intervals theorem by itself is weaker than other forms of completeness, although taken together with [[Archimedean property]], it is equivalent to the others.\n\n===Monotone convergence theorem===\nThe '''[[Monotone convergence theorem#Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers|monotone convergence theorem]]''' (described as the '''fundamental axiom of analysis''' by {{harvtxt|K\u00f6rner|2004}}) states that every nondecreasing, bounded sequence of real numbers converges.  This can be viewed as a special case of the least upper bound property, but it can also be used fairly directly to prove the Cauchy completeness of the real numbers.\n\n===Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem===\nThe '''[[Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]''' states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent [[subsequence]].  Again, this theorem is equivalent to the other forms of completeness given above.\n\n===The intermediate value theorem===\nThe '''[[intermediate value theorem]]''' states that every continuous function that attains both negative and positive values has a root. This is a consequence of the least upper bound property, but it can also be used to prove the least upper bound property if treated as an axiom. (The definition of continuity does not depend on any form of completeness, so this is not circular.)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of real analysis topics]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n | last       = Aliprantis\n | first      = Charalambos D\n | authorlink = Charalambos D.

With DWF functionality, publishers of design data can limit the specific design data and plot styles to only what they want recipients to see and can publish multisheet drawing sets from multiple [[AutoCAD]] drawings in a single DWF file. They can also publish [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models from most Autodesk design applications.\n\nDWF files are not a replacement for native CAD formats such as AutoCAD drawings ([[.dwg|DWG]]). The sole purpose of DWF is to allow designers, engineers, project managers, and their colleagues to communicate design information and design content to anyone needing to view, review, or print design information \u2013 without these team members needing to know AutoCAD or other [[Computer-aided design|design software]].\n\nAn Autodesk DWF advocate blog<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparison of DWF and PDF|url=http://dwf.blogs.com/beyond_the_paper/2006/06/comparison_of_d.html|work=Beyond the Paper|accessdate=3 May 2013}}[https://statuo.co.uk]</ref> cites as DWFs strengths over alternatives that the files have very high mathematical precision, and contain [[meta-data]] for sheets, objects and markup data.

A DWF file can describe design data containing any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device independent and resolution independent format. These files can be one sheet or multiple sheets, very simple or extremely complex with a rich use of fonts, graphics, color, and images. The format also includes intelligent [[metadata]] that captures the design intent of the data being represented.\n\nThe DWF technology centers on three components:\n* [[C++]] libraries for developers\n* a viewer for project team members who wish to view design data without knowing AutoCAD\n* a writer that allows anyone to create a DWF file from any application\n\n=== DWF Toolkit ===\nDWF is an open file format. Autodesk publishes the DWF specification and makes available [[C++]] libraries<ref>http://www.autodesk.com/dwftoolkit</ref> for any developer who wants to build applications around the DWF format, with the DWF Toolkit. Furthermore, DWF is based on other industry standards such as [[ZLIB]], [[XML]], and common image formats.\n\nDWF files (since version 6.0) are a [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]]-compressed container for the drawing files; despite the first few bytes of the file containing a DWF header, renaming a .dwf file to .zip will allow the component files inside to be viewed with archive compression software.

Autodesk DWF Writer is a Windows [[printer driver]] that converts files to DWF format. The result is that the entire project team can standardize on a common file format to exchange and review designs and sheet sets, at no additional cost.\n\n=== Freewheel ===\nIn 2007, Autodesk introduced an online translator for DWFs called [[Freewheel]]. Freewheel was a way to view a DWF file without downloading software. It was also a [[web service]] which offered developers a web-based interface for viewing, querying, and manipulating DWF files.\nFreewheel has been replaced by the web based viewing and editing [[web service]] [[Autodesk 360]].\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAutodesk's DWF viewers (except for Freewheel) are all based on [[Microsoft Windows]].\nThe DWF Toolkit is available on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]].\nThird parties have created DWF tools on other platforms besides Windows; an example is the [[MacOS|Mac OS X]] viewer McDwiff [http://www.macdwf.com/].\n\n== History ==\nThe DWF format first appeared in 1995 as part of the unveiling of Autodesk's \"WHIP!\" [[Netscape Navigator]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]. The format was originally referred to as the Drawing Web Format, since DWF files were generated by the Autodesk Internet Publishing Kit. As the format grew in use beyond just AutoCAD, it was renamed to Design Web Format. Although originally a 2D-only format, DWF has evolved to include 3D. Today DWF files are generated by all Autodesk products. In addition, there are a variety of third-party applications that make use of the format.\n\n== Alternatives ==\n[[PDF]] is an internationally recognized [[Open format|open]] [[file format]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] to allow electronic exchange of any printable document, independent of the source application software, hardware and operating system. [[PDF/E]] is a subset of v1.6 of the PDF specification specifically designed for engineering use.\n\n[[SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an [[Open format|open]], XML based file format.  It is suitable for use both as a format for creating and editing drawings and as a format for viewing and publication.  For instance, [[Inkscape]] uses SVG as its native format, and both the [[Firefox]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] browsers natively display SVG.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]\n* [[.dwg|DWG]]\n* [[DXF]]\n* [[PDF]]\n* [[PDF/E]]\n* [[Epaper|Epaper (Portable Drawing)]]\n* [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Please do not use this article to try and publicise software -->\n* [http://knowledge.autodesk.com/sites/default/files/file_downloads/dwfx.readme.html New format DWFx] based on [[XML Paper Specification]]\n\n{{AutoCAD related articles}}\n{{Vector graphics markup languages}}\n{{CAD software}}\n\n[[Category:CAD file formats]]\n[[Category:Vector graphics markup languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|DWF|the British law firm|DWF LLP}}\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = Design Web Format\n| icon = \n| iconcaption = \n| icon_size = \n| screenshot = \n| screenshot_size = \n| caption = \n|_noextcode = \n| extensions = .dwf, .dwfx              <!-- or: | extensions = -->\n|_nomimecode = \n| mime = \n| type code = \n| uniform_type = \n| conforms_to = \n| magic = \n| developer = [[Autodesk]]\n| released = {{start date and age|1995}}\n| latest_release_version = \n| latest_release_date =     <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes/no}} -->\n| genre = [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]\n| container_for = \n| contained_by = \n| extended_from = \n| extended_to = \n| standard =                <!-- or: | standards = -->\n| free = \n| url = \n}}\n'''Design Web Format''' (DWF) is a secure {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[file format]] developed by [[Autodesk]] for the efficient distribution and communication of rich design data to anyone who needs to view, review, or print design files.

Their partnership grew after graduation as part of the comedy group [[The Credibility Gap]] with [[Harry Shearer]] in Los Angeles, but McKean's breakthrough came in 1976 when he and Lander joined the cast of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' portraying Lenny and Squiggy. McKean directed one episode, and the characters became something of a phenomenon, even releasing an album as ''[[Lenny and the Squigtones]]'' in 1979, which featured a young [[Christopher Guest]] on guitar (credited as ''Nigel Tufnel''\u2014the name Guest would use a few years later as part of the spoof [[rock music|rock]] band, [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]). \"Foreign Legion of Love\" was a big hit for the Squigtones, with frequent play on the ''[[Dr. Demento#The Dr. Demento radio show|Dr. Demento Show]]''. McKean also played his character in an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''.

Their partnership grew after graduation as part of the comedy group [[The Credibility Gap]] with [[Harry Shearer]] in Los Angeles, but McKean's breakthrough came in 1976 when he and Lander joined the cast of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' portraying Lenny and Squiggy. McKean directed one episode, and the characters became something of a phenomenon, even releasing an album as ''[[Lenny and the Squigtones]]'' in 1979, which featured a young [[Christopher Guest]] on guitar (credited as ''Nigel Tufnel''\u2014the name Guest would use a few years later as part of the spoof [[rock music|rock]] band, [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]). \"Foreign Legion of Love\" was a big hit for the Squigtones, with frequent play on the ''[[Dr. Demento#The Dr. Demento radio show|Dr. Demento Show]]''. McKean also played his character in an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''.

Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to most other compounds.  Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons.  Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.\n\nBecause of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29&nbsp;\u00b0C, compared to 69&nbsp;\u00b0C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]], and 34.6&nbsp;\u00b0C for [[diethyl ether]].\n\n==Occurrence in nature==\nSimple alcohols are found widely in nature.  Ethanol is most prominent because it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway.  The other simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts.  More complex alcohols are pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Ziegler and oxo processes===\nIn the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/> An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown:\n\n:Al(C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|5}}){{sub|3}}  +  9 C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|4}}   \u2192  Al(C{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}){{sub|3}}\n:Al(C{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}){{sub|3}} +  3 O  +  3 H{{sub|2}}O  \u2192  3 HOC{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}  +  Al(OH){{sub|3}}\n\nThe process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].\n\nMany higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\n:RCH=CH{{sub|2}}  +  H{{sub|2}}  +  CO   \u2192  RCH{{sub|2}}CH{{sub|2}}CHO\n:RCH{{sub|2}}CH{{sub|2}}CHO +  3 H{{sub|2}}  \u2192  RCH{{sub|2}}CH{{sub|2}}CH{{sub|2}}OH\n\nSuch processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.\n\n===Hydration reactions===\nSome low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts.

For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme complex [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).\n\nSeveral species of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause \"[[auto-brewery syndrome]]\" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01873798 |pmid=6760604 |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author1=P.

(Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].\n\n====Reduction====\n[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto-esters.\n\n====Hydrolysis====\n[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.\n\nThe formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:\n\n:[[File:Secondary alcohol formation-diagram.svg|frameless|upright=1.6|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]\n\n==Reactions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===Deprotonation===\nWith a [[pKa|pK{{sub|a}}]] of around 16\u201319, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]].

In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than in water.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Nucleophilic substitution===\nThe OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R\u2212OH{{sub|2}}<sup>+</sup>, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.svg|frameless|upright=3.2|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]\n\nAlcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:\n\n: 3 R-OH + PBr{{sub|3}} \u2192 3 RBr + H{{sub|3}}PO{{sub|3}}\n\nIn the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.\n\n===Dehydration===\nMeanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:\n\n[[File:Methanol acid base.svg|frameless|upright=2.25|Acidity & basicity of methanol]]\n\nUpon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 [[elimination reaction]] to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.\n\nThis is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethylene]]:\n\n[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|frameless|upright=2.5]]\n\nA more controlled elimination reaction requires the formation of the [[xanthate ester]].\n\n===Protonolysis===\nTertiary alcohols react with strong acids to generate carbocations.  The reaction is related to their dehydration, e.g. isobutylene from tert-butyl alcohol. A special kind of dehydration reaction involves [[triphenylmethanol]] and especially its amine-substituted derivatives.  When treated with acid, these alcohols lose water to give stable carbocations, which are commercial dyes.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann's | last1 = Gessner | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Mayer | first2 = Udo | title = Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_179}}</ref>\n[[image:Kristallviolett Darstellung.svg|thumb|right|322px|Preparation of [[crystal violet]] by protonolysis of the tertiary alcohol.]]\n\n===Esterification===\nAlcohol and [[carboxylic acid]]s react in the so-called [[Fischer esterification]].

The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.\n\nThe direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH){{sub|2}}) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.\n\n[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|upright=2.25|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]\n\nReagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]].

Doses of several milliliters are tolerated.  For [[pentanol]]s, [[hexanol]]s, [[octanol]]s and longer alcohols, [[LD50]] range from 2\u20135 g/kg (rats, oral).  Methanol and ethanol are less acutely toxic.  All alcohols are mild skin irritants.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\nThe metabolism of methanol (and ethylene glycol) is affected by the presence of ethanol, which has a higher affinity for [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]].  In this way methanol will be excreted intact in urine.<ref name=\"Schep\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |pages=b3929 |date=30 September 2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = HE | last2 = Burkhart | first2 = KK | last3 = Donovan | first3 = JW | title = Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning: diagnosis and treatment | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 116\u201320 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10097201 | name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1016/S0099-1767(99)70156-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lobert | first1 = S | title = Ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Critical Care Nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 41\u20137 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11878258 | name-list-format=vanc| doi = 10.4037/ccn2000.20.6.41 }}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties==\nIn general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes alcohols [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to most other compounds.  Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons.  Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.\n\nBecause of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29&nbsp;\u00b0C, compared to 69&nbsp;\u00b0C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]], and 34.6&nbsp;\u00b0C for [[diethyl ether]].\n\n==Occurrence in nature==\nSimple alcohols are found widely in nature.  Ethanol is most prominent because it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway.  The other simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts.  More complex alcohols are pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Ziegler and oxo processes===\nIn the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/> An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown:\n\n:Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>  +  9 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>   \u2192  Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\n:Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub> +  3 O  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  \u2192  3 HOC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>  +  Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].\n\nMany higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\n:RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>  +  CO   \u2192  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO\n:RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO +  3 H<sub>2</sub>  \u2192  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH\n\nSuch processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.\n\n===Hydration reactions===\nSome low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])<ref name=\"ECT4 820\">{{cite book |author =Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor=Kroschwitz J.I. |title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th |volume=9 |page=820 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-52677-3}}</ref> or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].\n\nHydration is also used industrially to produce the diol [[ethylene glycol]] from [[ethylene oxide]].\n\n===Biological routes===\nEthanol is obtained by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&nbsp;\u00b0C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme complex [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).\n\nSeveral species of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause \"[[auto-brewery syndrome]]\" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01873798 |pmid=6760604 |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author1=P.

(Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].\n\n====Reduction====\n[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto-esters.\n\n====Hydrolysis====\n[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.\n\nThe formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:\n\n:[[File:Secondary alcohol formation-diagram.svg|frameless|upright=1.6|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]\n\n==Reactions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===Deprotonation===\nWith a [[pKa|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of around 16\u201319, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]].

In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than in water.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Nucleophilic substitution===\nThe OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R\u2212OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.svg|frameless|upright=3.2|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]\n\nAlcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:\n\n: 3 R-OH + PBr<sub>3</sub> \u2192 3 RBr + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>\n\nIn the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.\n\n===Dehydration===\nMeanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:\n\n[[File:Methanol acid base.svg|frameless|upright=2.25|Acidity & basicity of methanol]]\n\nUpon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 [[elimination reaction]] to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.\n\nThis is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethylene]]:\n\n[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|frameless|upright=2.5]]\n\nA more controlled elimination reaction requires the formation of the [[xanthate ester]].\n\n===Protonolysis===\nTertiary alcohols react with strong acids to generate carbocations.  The reaction is related to their dehydration, e.g. isobutylene from tert-butyl alcohol. A special kind of dehydration reaction involves [[triphenylmethanol]] and especially its amine-substituted derivatives.  When treated with acid, these alcohols lose water to give stable carbocations, which are commercial dyes.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann's | last1 = Gessner | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Mayer | first2 = Udo | title = Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_179}}</ref>\n[[image:Kristallviolett Darstellung.svg|thumb|right|322px|Preparation of [[crystal violet]] by protonolysis of the tertiary alcohol.]]\n\n===Esterification===\nAlcohol and [[carboxylic acid]]s react in the so-called [[Fischer esterification]].

The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.\n\nThe direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.\n\n[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|upright=2.25|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]\n\nReagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]].
