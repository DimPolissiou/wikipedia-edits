Brigham City saw most of its growth during the 1950s and 1960s, but has seen a struggling economy and stagnating growth since then. It is near the headquarters of ATK [[Thiokol]], the company that created the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s for the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]].\n\nBrigham City is known for its peaches and holds an annual celebration called Peach Days on the weekend after [[Labor Day]]. Much of Main Street is closed off to cars, and the festival is celebrated by a parade, a car show, a carnival, and other activities.   [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) dedicated its fourteenth [[Brigham City Utah Temple|temple]] in Utah in Brigham City on 23 September 2012.\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the [[Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation]], a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Shoshone people]].<ref>[http://www.nwbshoshone-nsn.gov/contact/index.htm \"Contact Information.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603075410/http://www.nwbshoshone-nsn.gov/contact/index.htm |date=June 3, 2013 }} ''Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation.''

[[Brigham Young]] directed [[Lorenzo Snow]] to lead additional settlers to the site and foster a self-sufficient city at the site in 1853.\n\n[[File:Bird's-eye view of Brigham City and Great Salt Lake, Utah, Ty. 1875.

In 1864, the cooperative movement began in earnest with the creation of a mercantile co-op store and was an important element of the [[United Order]]. Other industries were added, and the Brigham City Co-op is widely recognized as the most successful of the Mormon Co-op ventures. Economic hardships brought an end to the Co-op in 1895, though the Co-op had first started selling businesses off in 1876.<ref>[http://brighamcityhistory.org Brigham City History Project]</ref>\n\nWorld War II brought a major economic boost to the city. The federal government created Bushnell General Hospital on Brigham City's south side to treat soldiers wounded in the war. Locals sold supplies and food to the hospital while hospital staff patronized local businesses. After the war, the hospital's buildings were used as [[Intermountain Indian School]]. Many young Native Americans attended the boarding school until it closed in 1984, although the Intermountain \"I\" on the mountain is still visible in tandem with Box Elder High School's \"B\". The facility has left its mark in a number of other ways, with most of the buildings still standing. Some have been converted into businesses and condos, while others remain empty.  Utah State University purchased the site and demolished all remaining buildings in 2013.  The Utah State University Brigham City regional campus will be expanded to permanent buildings on this site and will mainly serve students from Box Elder, Weber and Davis counties.<ref>http://news.hjnews.com/allaccess/utah-state-university-to-break-ground-on-new-brigham-city/article_5ec26116-4c35-11e4-bafc-5702453b2b97.html</ref>  Construction will begin in the fall of 2014.\n\nDespite layoffs over the past decade, much of Brigham City's economy relies on [[Thiokol]], the creator of many missiles, as well as the [[solid rocket booster]] for the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]]. Additionally, the local [[Autoliv]] (formerly a part of Thiokol) airbag plants also net Brigham City many jobs. [[Nucor]] Corporation has two facilities in Brigham City, in addition to its steel mill in nearby [[Plymouth, Utah|Plymouth]].  The addition of a [[Walmart]] distribution center in nearby [[Corinne, Utah|Corinne]] has also brought new jobs.\n\n===Historic sites===\n\n====Baron Woolen Mills====\nBuilt in 1870 as part of the Brigham City Manufacturing and Mercantile Association, the mill produced high-quality blankets and sweaters from locally produced wool fleeces.<ref>Bradford, Kathleen. 1995.

Brigham City is generally considered to be the northern end of the [[Wasatch Front]]. To the west is a large, flat region of desert scrub, eventually giving way to marshlands on the edge of the [[Great Salt Lake]]. Interstates [[Interstate 15 in Utah|15]] and [[Interstate 84 in Utah|84]] pass to the west of the city together. [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] approaches from the south and [[U.S. Route 91 (Utah)|U.S. 91]] comes from I-15/84 to the west. They intersect in the city, climbing through Box Elder Canyon together. Two routes of the [[Utah Transit Authority]]'s bus system also provide access to Brigham City from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and it also has a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus stop. It is planned to be the northern terminus of the ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line by 2020.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|62.6|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 1.40%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> It lies at an elevation of {{convert|4315|ft}}.\n\nThe climate of Brigham City is generally similar to that of the rest of the Wasatch Front, though slightly cooler. According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Brigham City has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''). Snow is heavy in winter with an annual average of {{convert|50.0|in|cm}}, although it is too far north to receive [[lake-effect snow]]. Precipitation is light, averaging {{convert|18.46|in|mm}} annually. Summers are hot, but humidity remains low and overnight temperatures are cool, and winters are cold (but rarely frigid). April is the wettest month, while July is the driest.<ref>[http://brighamcity.utah.gov/economic_development.climate.html brighamcity.utah.gov]</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brigham City, Utah (1981\u20132010)\n|single line = Y\n\n|Jan high F = 31.5\n|Feb high F = 37.5\n|Mar high F = 49.1\n|Apr high F = 57.6\n|May high F = 67.4\n|Jun high F = 77.8\n|Jul high F = 86.7\n|Aug high F = 85.3\n|Sep high F = 74.9\n|Oct high F = 61.0\n|Nov high F = 44.6\n|Dec high F = 33.1\n|year high F = 58.9\n\n|Jan mean F = 21.8\n|Feb mean F = 26.5\n|Mar mean F = 36.9\n|Apr mean F = 44.2\n|May mean F = 52.7\n|Jun mean F = 61.4\n|Jul mean F = 68.8\n|Aug mean F = 67.4\n|Sep mean F = 57.7\n|Oct mean F = 45.7\n|Nov mean F = 33.2\n|Dec mean F = 23.4\n|year mean F = 45.0\n\n|Jan low F = 13.5\n|Feb low F = 16.9\n|Mar low F = 26.2\n|Apr low F = 31.9\n|May low F = 39.3\n|Jun low F = 46.4\n|Jul low F = 52.4\n|Aug low F = 51.0\n|Sep low F = 41.9\n|Oct low F = 32.0\n|Nov low F = 23.0\n|Dec low F = 15.6\n|year low F = 32.5\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.62\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.45\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.56\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.81\n|May precipitation inch = 2.05\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.07\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.72\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.67\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.51\n|Oct precipitation inch = 1.81\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.42\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.36\n|year precipitation inch= 16.77\n\n|Jan snow inch = 13.1\n|Feb snow inch = 9.6\n|Mar snow inch = 5.0\n|Apr snow inch = 1.8\n|May snow inch = 0.0\n|Jun snow inch = 0.0\n|Jul snow inch = 0.0\n|Aug snow inch = 0.0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.9\n|Nov snow inch = 4.5\n|Dec snow inch = 11.7\n|year snow inch = 46.6\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=slc\n  | title = NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n  | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  | accessdate = May 5, 2013\n}}</ref>\n|date=May 2013\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 975\n|1870= 1315\n|1880= 1877\n|1890= 2139\n|1900= 2859\n|1910= 3685\n|1920= 5282\n|1930= 5093\n|1940= 5641\n|1950= 6790\n|1960= 11728\n|1970= 14007\n|1980= 15596\n|1990= 15644\n|2000= 17412\n|2010= 17899\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=19404\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,411 people, 5,526 households, and 4,409 families residing in the city.

Brigham City saw most of its growth during the 1950s and 1960s, but has seen a struggling economy and stagnating growth since then. It is near the headquarters of ATK [[Thiokol]], the company that created the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s for the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]].\n\nBrigham City is known for its peaches and holds an annual celebration called Peach Days on the weekend after [[Labor Day]]. Much of Main Street is closed off to cars, and the festival is celebrated by a parade, a car show, a carnival, and other activities.   [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) dedicated its fourteenth [[Brigham City Utah Temple|temple]] in Utah in Brigham City on 23 September 2012.\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the [[Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation]], a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Shoshone people]].<ref>[http://www.nwbshoshone-nsn.gov/contact/index.htm \"Contact Information.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603075410/http://www.nwbshoshone-nsn.gov/contact/index.htm |date=June 3, 2013 }} ''Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation.''

[[Brigham Young]] directed [[Lorenzo Snow]] to lead additional settlers to the site and foster a self-sufficient city at the site in 1853.\n\n[[File:Bird's-eye view of Brigham City and Great Salt Lake, Utah, Ty. 1875.

In 1864, the cooperative movement began in earnest with the creation of a mercantile co-op store and was an important element of the [[United Order]]. Other industries were added, and the Brigham City Co-op is widely recognized as the most successful of the Mormon Co-op ventures. Economic hardships brought an end to the Co-op in 1895, though the Co-op had first started selling businesses off in 1876.<ref>[http://brighamcityhistory.org Brigham City History Project]</ref>\n\nWorld War II brought a major economic boost to the city. The federal government created Bushnell General Hospital on Brigham City's south side to treat soldiers wounded in the war. Locals sold supplies and food to the hospital while hospital staff patronized local businesses. After the war, the hospital's buildings were used as [[Intermountain Indian School]]. Many young Native Americans attended the boarding school until it closed in 1984, although the Intermountain \"I\" on the mountain is still visible in tandem with Box Elder High School's \"B\". The facility has left its mark in a number of other ways, with most of the buildings still standing. Some have been converted into businesses and condos, while others remain empty.  Utah State University purchased the site and demolished all remaining buildings in 2013.  The Utah State University Brigham City regional campus will be expanded to permanent buildings on this site and will mainly serve students from Box Elder, Weber and Davis counties.<ref>http://news.hjnews.com/allaccess/utah-state-university-to-break-ground-on-new-brigham-city/article_5ec26116-4c35-11e4-bafc-5702453b2b97.html</ref>  Construction will begin in the fall of 2014.\n\nDespite layoffs over the past decade, much of Brigham City's economy relies on [[Thiokol]], the creator of many missiles, as well as the [[solid rocket booster]] for the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]]. Additionally, the local [[Autoliv]] (formerly a part of Thiokol) airbag plants also net Brigham City many jobs. [[Nucor]] Corporation has two facilities in Brigham City, in addition to its steel mill in nearby [[Plymouth, Utah|Plymouth]].  The addition of a [[Walmart]] distribution center in nearby [[Corinne, Utah|Corinne]] has also brought new jobs.\n\n===Historic sites===\n\n====Baron Woolen Mills====\nBuilt in 1870 as part of the Brigham City Manufacturing and Mercantile Association, the mill produced high-quality blankets and sweaters from locally produced wool fleeces.<ref>Bradford, Kathleen. 1995.

Brigham City is generally considered to be the northern end of the [[Wasatch Front]]. To the west is a large, flat region of desert scrub, eventually giving way to marshlands on the edge of the [[Great Salt Lake]]. Interstates [[Interstate 15 in Utah|15]] and [[Interstate 84 in Utah|84]] pass to the west of the city together. [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] approaches from the south and [[U.S. Route 91 (Utah)|U.S. 91]] comes from I-15/84 to the west. They intersect in the city, climbing through Box Elder Canyon together. Two routes of the [[Utah Transit Authority]]'s bus system also provide access to Brigham City from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and it also has a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus stop. It is planned to be the northern terminus of the ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line by 2020.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|62.6|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 1.40%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> It lies at an elevation of {{convert|4315|ft}}.\n\nThe climate of Brigham City is generally similar to that of the rest of the Wasatch Front, though slightly cooler. According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Brigham City has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''). Snow is heavy in winter with an annual average of {{convert|50.0|in|cm}}, although it is too far north to receive [[lake-effect snow]]. Precipitation is light, averaging {{convert|18.46|in|mm}} annually. Summers are hot, but humidity remains low and overnight temperatures are cool, and winters are cold (but rarely frigid). April is the wettest month, while July is the driest.<ref>[http://brighamcity.utah.gov/economic_development.climate.html brighamcity.utah.gov]</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brigham City, Utah (1981\u20132010)\n|single line = Y\n\n|Jan high F = 31.5\n|Feb high F = 37.5\n|Mar high F = 49.1\n|Apr high F = 57.6\n|May high F = 67.4\n|Jun high F = 77.8\n|Jul high F = 86.7\n|Aug high F = 85.3\n|Sep high F = 74.9\n|Oct high F = 61.0\n|Nov high F = 44.6\n|Dec high F = 33.1\n|year high F = 58.9\n\n|Jan mean F = 21.8\n|Feb mean F = 26.5\n|Mar mean F = 36.9\n|Apr mean F = 44.2\n|May mean F = 52.7\n|Jun mean F = 61.4\n|Jul mean F = 68.8\n|Aug mean F = 67.4\n|Sep mean F = 57.7\n|Oct mean F = 45.7\n|Nov mean F = 33.2\n|Dec mean F = 23.4\n|year mean F = 45.0\n\n|Jan low F = 13.5\n|Feb low F = 16.9\n|Mar low F = 26.2\n|Apr low F = 31.9\n|May low F = 39.3\n|Jun low F = 46.4\n|Jul low F = 52.4\n|Aug low F = 51.0\n|Sep low F = 41.9\n|Oct low F = 32.0\n|Nov low F = 23.0\n|Dec low F = 15.6\n|year low F = 32.5\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.62\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.45\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.56\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.81\n|May precipitation inch = 2.05\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.07\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.72\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.67\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.51\n|Oct precipitation inch = 1.81\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.42\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.36\n|year precipitation inch= 16.77\n\n|Jan snow inch = 13.1\n|Feb snow inch = 9.6\n|Mar snow inch = 5.0\n|Apr snow inch = 1.8\n|May snow inch = 0.0\n|Jun snow inch = 0.0\n|Jul snow inch = 0.0\n|Aug snow inch = 0.0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.9\n|Nov snow inch = 4.5\n|Dec snow inch = 11.7\n|year snow inch = 46.6\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=slc\n  | title = NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n  | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  | accessdate = May 5, 2013\n}}</ref>\n|date=May 2013\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 975\n|1870= 1315\n|1880= 1877\n|1890= 2139\n|1900= 2859\n|1910= 3685\n|1920= 5282\n|1930= 5093\n|1940= 5641\n|1950= 6790\n|1960= 11728\n|1970= 14007\n|1980= 15596\n|1990= 15644\n|2000= 17412\n|2010= 17899\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=19404\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,411 people, 5,526 households, and 4,409 families residing in the city.

It has 14 members of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] and four [[Members of the European Parliament]]. It was the junior partner in a coalition with [[Civic Platform]]. It is a member of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party group]] in the European Parliament.\n\nThe party was formed in 1990 as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party. The PSL formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) after winning 132 seats in the Sejm at the [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 election]], with PSL leader [[Waldemar Pawlak]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] until 1995. The party fell to 27 at the [[1997 Polish parliamentary election|next election]], and moved towards the centre at the end of the 1990s. [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|In 2001]], the party re-entered a coalition with the SLD, but withdrew in 2003. After the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 election]], the PSL entered a coalition with the [[centrist]] [[Liberalism in Poland|liberal]] [[Civic Platform]] (PO).\n\nThe party's name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]], which sent MPs to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament in Vienna]]. Until the 2014 [[2014 Polish local elections|local election]], the PSL formed self-government coalition in fifteen to sixteen [[Voivodeship sejmik|regional assemblies]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1945===\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of [[Rzeszow]] under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe (People's Party). The party changed its name in 1903 to what it's known as now. The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful, seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century. In the [[Second Polish Republic]] there were a few parties named PSL ([[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Left\"]] and others) until they were removed by the [[Sanacja]] regime (see also [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]]).\n\nDuring this time there were two parties using the term \"Polish People's Party\": [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] (which were merged into [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] with [[Stronnictwo Ch\u0142opskie]]). During [[World War II]], PSL took part in forming the [[Polish government in exile]].\n\n===Under the communist regime===\n[[File:PSL w Powiatach Barry Kent.png|right|thumb|250px|Support for the PSL by region]]\nAfter the war, [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]], a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, returned to communist-dominated Poland, where he joined the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|provisional government]] and [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|rebuilt PSL]]. The party hoped to win the [[Yalta Conference]]-mandated elections and help establish a [[parliamentary system]] in Poland. The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them. The [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary election]] was heavily rigged, with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote. Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly.\n\nMiko\u0142ajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life. The communists then forced the remains of Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL to unite with the pro-communist People's Party to form the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. The ZSL was a governing partner in the [[Front of National Unity|ruling coalition]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34-36\">[[David Ost]], ''Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics'', pp. 34-36, 1990 Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]], {{ISBN|0-87722-655-5}}</ref>\n\n===After the fall of the regime===\nAround the time of the [[fall of communism]] several PSLs were recreated, including: [[Polish People's Party\u2013Peasants' Agreement|Porozumienie Ludowe]], Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe - Odrodzenie, and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (Wilan\u00f3w faction). In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] grouping, and in 1990 changed its name to PSL.\n\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s, entering into coalitions with the postcommunist [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. However, in the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary elections]] PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, an alliance which later broke down. Since then PSL has moved towards more [[centrism|centrist]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] policies.\n\n===After 2004===\nThe party ran in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Poland|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and received 6% of the vote, giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]] the party received 7% of votes, giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate. In the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] the party placed fourth, with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats, and entered into a governing coalition with the victor, the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right conservative]] [[Civic Platform]] (''Platforma Obywatelska'').\n\n===Current situation===\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009.\n\nIn [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 national parliamentary election]] Polish People's Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate.<ref name=\"pkw-results2011\">{{cite web|url=http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|title=Elections 2011 - Election results|publisher=National Electoral Commission|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075746/http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|archivedate=14 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote, just barely over the 5 percent threshold.

The party advocates [[economic protectionism]] by the state  (especially in agriculture), and \"slower [[privatization]]\" (although it is not against privatization). On social and ethical issues, PSL opposes abortion, same-sex marriage, soft drug decriminalization, euthanasia and death penalty. It also supports mandatory [[State school|public (state) education]] and [[publicly funded health care]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Support===\nParty traditionally representing farmers, peasants and rural voters generally. Voters are generally more [[social conservative]] than voters of [[Civic Platform]]. Regionally, it has more support in western parts of country. The party has less support in larger cities and mining areas of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

It has 14 members of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] and four [[Members of the European Parliament]]. It was the junior partner in a coalition with [[Civic Platform]]. It is a member of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party group]] in the European Parliament.\n\nThe party was formed in 1990 as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party. The PSL formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) after winning 132 seats in the Sejm at the [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 election]], with PSL leader [[Waldemar Pawlak]] as [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] until 1995. The party fell to 27 at the [[1997 Polish parliamentary election|next election]], and moved towards the centre at the end of the 1990s. [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|In 2001]], the party re-entered a coalition with the SLD, but withdrew in 2003. After the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 election]], the PSL entered a coalition with the [[centrist]] [[Liberalism in Poland|liberal]] [[Civic Platform]] (PO).\n\nThe party's name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]], which sent MPs to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament in Vienna]]. Until the 2014 [[2014 Polish local elections|local election]], the PSL formed self-government coalition in fifteen to sixteen [[Voivodeship sejmik|regional assemblies]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1945===\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of [[Rzeszow]] under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe (People's Party). The party changed its name in 1903 to what it's known as now. The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful, seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century. In the [[Second Polish Republic]] there were a few parties named PSL ([[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]], [[Polish People's Party \"Left\"]] and others) until they were removed by the [[Sanacja]] regime (see also [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]]).\n\nDuring this time there were two parties using the term \"Polish People's Party\": [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] (which were merged into [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] with [[Stronnictwo Ch\u0142opskie]]). During [[World War II]], PSL took part in forming the [[Polish government in exile]].\n\n===Under the communist regime===\n[[File:PSL w Powiatach Barry Kent.png|right|thumb|250px|Support for the PSL by region]]\nAfter the war, [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]], a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, returned to communist-dominated Poland, where he joined the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|provisional government]] and [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|rebuilt PSL]]. The party hoped to win the [[Yalta Conference]]-mandated elections and help establish a [[parliamentary system]] in Poland. The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them. The [[1947 Polish legislative election|1947 parliamentary election]] was heavily rigged, with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote. Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly.\n\nMiko\u0142ajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life. The communists then forced the remains of Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL to unite with the pro-communist People's Party to form the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. The ZSL was a governing partner in the [[Front of National Unity|ruling coalition]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34-36\">[[David Ost]], ''Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics'', pp. 34-36, 1990 Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]], {{ISBN|0-87722-655-5}}</ref>\n\n===After the fall of the regime===\nAround the time of the [[fall of communism]] several PSLs were recreated, including: [[Polish People's Party\u2013Peasants' Agreement|Porozumienie Ludowe]], Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe - Odrodzenie, and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (Wilan\u00f3w faction). In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] grouping, and in 1990 changed its name to PSL.\n\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s, entering into coalitions with the postcommunist [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. However, in the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary elections]] PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, an alliance which later broke down. Since then PSL has moved towards more [[centrism|centrist]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] policies.\n\n===After 2004===\nThe party ran in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Poland|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and received 6% of the vote, giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]] the party received 7% of votes, giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate. In the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] the party placed fourth, with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats, and entered into a governing coalition with the victor, the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right conservative]] [[Civic Platform]] (''Platforma Obywatelska'').\n\n===Current situation===\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009.\n\nIn [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 national parliamentary election]] Polish People's Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate.<ref name=\"pkw-results2011\">{{cite web|url=http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|title=Elections 2011 - Election results|publisher=National Electoral Commission|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075746/http://wybory2011.pkw.gov.pl/wsw/en/000000.html|archivedate=14 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote, just barely over the 5 percent threshold.

The party advocates [[economic protectionism]] by the state  (especially in agriculture), and \"slower [[privatization]]\" (although it is not against privatization). On social and ethical issues, PSL opposes abortion, same-sex marriage, soft drug decriminalization, euthanasia and death penalty. It also supports mandatory [[State school|public (state) education]] and [[publicly funded health care]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Support===\nParty traditionally representing farmers, peasants and rural voters generally. Voters are generally more [[social conservative]] than voters of [[Civic Platform]]. Regionally, it has more support in western parts of country. The party has less support in larger cities and mining areas of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]]. In [[2019 Polish parliamentary election|2019 election]] PSL gained surprisingly significant support in cities and won mandates e.g. in Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw.\n\n===Sejm===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
