[[AllMusic]] described ''Rocks'' as having \"captured Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking.\" ''Rocks'' was ranked number 176 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. It has greatly influenced many [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] artists, including [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Metallica]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. The album was a commercial success, charting three singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], two of which reached the [[Top 40]] (\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\" and \"[[Last Child]]\"). The album was one of the first to ship [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] when it was released, and has since gone quadruple platinum.<ref name=\"RIAA\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=aerosmith#search_section |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database: search for Aerosmith |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=January 28, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nPreviously, Aerosmith had recorded three albums: ''[[Aerosmith (album)|Aerosmith]]'' (1973), ''[[Get Your Wings]]'' (1974), and the breakthrough LP ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1975), which produced Top Ten hit \"[[Walk This Way]]\" and the popular \"[[Sweet Emotion]].\" Although often derided by critics, the band had amassed a loyal fanbase, following from relentless touring and their ferocious live shows. They also began living the rock-and-roll lifestyle to the hilt, indulging their already considerable appetite for drugs. However, their hedonistic lifestyle did not appear to hamper them creatively; ''Rocks'' was considered by many fans, critics, and fellow musicians to be one of the highlights of their career. Guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] later recalled, \"There's no doubt we were doing a lot of drugs by then, but whatever we were doing, it was still working for us.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=252}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\nIn the 1997 band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Brad Whitford]] states that the band began work on the album by backing the [[Record Plant]]'s mobile recording truck into their rehearsal space, named the Wherehouse, and \"let fly{{nbsp}}... We were living the high life and not paying attention to anything except making this record. I had the beginnings of '[[Last Child]]' and '[[Nobody's Fault]].' Tom [Hamilton, bassist] had 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' that became 'Sick as a Dog.' We had 'Tit for Tat'{{nbsp}}... which turned into '[[Rats in the Cellar]].' We cut all the basic tracks except two there.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=250-251}} Producer [[Jack Douglas (record producer)|Jack Douglas]] later insisted:\n{{quote|''Rocks'' was the album where Tom and Brad had a lot more input and songs{{nbsp}}... This was a big album for Aerosmith. It had to make a big statement about how loud and hard they were, how unapologetic they felt about being who they were{{snd}}this brash, rude, sexual, hard-core rock band.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997||p=253}}}}\n\nThe album's opening track, \"[[Back in the Saddle]]\", recalls the [[Gene Autry]] song \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\" (vocalist Steven Tyler yodels on the fade) and features the sound of a whip by whirling a thirty-foot cord in the middle of six Neumann mikes and adding a cap gun for the cracking sound effect. A real bullwhip was intended to be used for the whip effects and hours were spent trying to get it to crack. The band members ended up cut up and hurt without making any progress. The first verse features the sound of clinking spurs, which was actually produced using bells and tambourines strapped to Tyler\u2019s cowboy boots by Perry and [[New York Dolls]] singer [[David Johansen]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Dan |title=Aerosmith Tell the Story Behind Their Hard-Rock Masterpiece \u2018Toys in the Attic\u2019 |url=https://www.spin.com/2015/05/aerosmith-toys-in-the-attic-40th-anniversary-oral-history/ |website=Spin |accessdate=4 January 2019 |date=4 May 2015}}</ref> The song is also notable for the slow buildup of the drum beat and guitar riff in the beginning of the song, as well as the sound effects of a galloping horse.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=253-254}} In 1997, Perry explained to Alan di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' that he was inspired by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] to write the riff on a [[Fender Bass VI]] and admitted that he was \"very high on heroin when I wrote 'Back in the Saddle.' That riff just floated right through me.\"<ref name=\"diperna\">{{cite magazine |title=Aerosmith |magazine=[[Guitar World]] |date=April 1997 |last=Di Perna |first=Alan |volume=17 |issue=4 }}</ref> Brad Whitford plays the lead guitar part. \"Back in the Saddle\" also features one of the heaviest and noticeable bass lines by [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]. When the song is performed in concert, Steven Tyler often makes more noticeable lyrical and visible references to sex. Although the lyrics, composed by Tyler, were written with the simple idea of cowboys and sex, this song took on new meaning after Aerosmith reunited in 1984 and embarked on their Back in the Saddle tour. Today, the song remains a staple on classic rock radio and in concert. It is arguably one of the heaviest songs of Aerosmith's [[Top 40]] singles, and is cited by rock musicians [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[James Hetfield]] as among their favorite rock songs. Hamilton, who had written \"Sweet Emotion\" with Tyler, collaborated with the singer again on \"Sick as a Dog.\" In 1997 the bassist explained to ''Guitar World'', \"I think I came up with the verse part first. And then I did the parts for the intro, the B to E part, and then came up with this little, jangling arpeggio thing{{nbsp}}... I'm such a [[Byrds]] fan; it comes from that.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Aerosmith |magazine=[[Guitar World]] |date=March 1997 |last=Di Perna |first=Alan |volume=17 |issue=3 }}</ref> In the same interview Perry added:\n{{quote|Tom played rhythm guitar on \"Sick as a Dog.\" I played bass for the first half of the song. Then I put the bass down and played guitar in the end, and Steven picked up the bass and played it for the rest of the song{{snd}}all live in the studio! One take.<ref name=\"diperna\"/>}}\n\nIn his memoir, Tyler stated that he wrote \"Rats in the Cellar\" as a \"tip of the hat, or an answer to 'Toys in the Attic'{{nbsp}}... Meanwhile, in real life, 'Rats' was more like what was actually going on. Things were coming apart, sanity was scurrying south, caution was flung to the winds, and little by little the chaos was permanently moving in.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=126}} Although it was never a popular Aerosmith number, \"Nobody's Fault\" remains a favorite of the band's, with Tyler calling it \"one of the highlights of my creative career\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=123}} and Kramer insisting \"it's some of the best drumming I did.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=255}} Tyler claims the lyrics have to do with the band's fear of earthquakes and flying, while \"Lick and a Promise\" is about the band's determination to deliver a rocking live show.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=255-256}} \"Combination\" features Perry sharing lead vocal duties with Tyler for the first time, and the guitarist admitted in 1997 that the song was \"about heroin, cocaine, and me\".{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=256}} In his memoir, Tyler calls the line \"Walkin' on [[Gucci]] wearing [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves St. Laurent]]/Barely stay on 'cause I'm so goddamn gaunt\" the best lyric Perry ever wrote: \"It was the truth, it was clever, and it described us to a tee\".{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=134}} Regarding his vocal on the song, Perry later commented, \"This was touchy because singing was Steven's jealously guarded territory{{nbsp}}...

American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Aerosmith]], released in May 1976. [[AllMusic]] described ''Rocks'' as having \"captured Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking.\" ''Rocks'' was ranked number 176 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. It has greatly influenced many [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] artists, including [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Metallica]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. The album was a commercial success, charting three singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], two of which reached the [[Top 40]] (\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\" and \"[[Last Child]]\"). The album was one of the first to ship [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] when it was released, and has since gone quadruple platinum.<ref name=\"RIAA\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=aerosmith#search_section |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database: search for Aerosmith |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=January 28, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nPreviously, Aerosmith had recorded three albums: ''[[Aerosmith (album)|Aerosmith]]'' (1973), ''[[Get Your Wings]]'' (1974), and the breakthrough LP ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1975), which produced Top Ten hit \"[[Walk This Way]]\" and the popular \"[[Sweet Emotion]].\" Although often derided by critics, the band had amassed a loyal fanbase, following from relentless touring and their ferocious live shows. They also began living the rock-and-roll lifestyle to the hilt, indulging their already considerable appetite for drugs. However, their hedonistic lifestyle did not appear to hamper them creatively; ''Rocks'' was considered by many fans, critics, and fellow musicians to be one of the highlights of their career. Guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] later recalled, \"There's no doubt we were doing a lot of drugs by then, but whatever we were doing, it was still working for us.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=252}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\nIn the 1997 band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Brad Whitford]] states that the band began work on the album by backing the [[Record Plant]]'s mobile recording truck into their rehearsal space, named the Wherehouse, and \"let fly{{nbsp}}... We were living the high life and not paying attention to anything except making this record. I had the beginnings of '[[Last Child]]' and '[[Nobody's Fault]].' Tom [Hamilton, bassist] had 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' that became 'Sick as a Dog.' We had 'Tit for Tat'{{nbsp}}... which turned into '[[Rats in the Cellar]].' We cut all the basic tracks except two there.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=250-251}} Producer [[Jack Douglas (record producer)|Jack Douglas]] later insisted:\n{{quote|''Rocks'' was the album where Tom and Brad had a lot more input and songs{{nbsp}}... This was a big album for Aerosmith. It had to make a big statement about how loud and hard they were, how unapologetic they felt about being who they were{{snd}}this brash, rude, sexual, hard-core rock band.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997||p=253}}}}\n\nThe album's opening track, \"[[Back in the Saddle]]\", recalls the [[Gene Autry]] song \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\" (vocalist Steven Tyler yodels on the fade) and features the sound of a whip by whirling a thirty-foot cord in the middle of six Neumann mikes and adding a cap gun for the cracking sound effect. A real bullwhip was intended to be used for the whip effects and hours were spent trying to get it to crack. The band members ended up cut up and hurt without making any progress. The first verse features the sound of clinking spurs, which was actually produced using bells and tambourines strapped to Tyler\u2019s cowboy boots by Perry and [[New York Dolls]] singer [[David Johansen]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Dan |title=Aerosmith Tell the Story Behind Their Hard-Rock Masterpiece \u2018Toys in the Attic\u2019 |url=https://www.spin.com/2015/05/aerosmith-toys-in-the-attic-40th-anniversary-oral-history/ |website=Spin |accessdate=4 January 2019 |date=4 May 2015}}</ref> The song is also notable for the slow buildup of the drum beat and guitar riff in the beginning of the song, as well as the sound effects of a galloping horse.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|pp=253-254}} In 1997, Perry explained to Alan di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' that he was inspired by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] to write the riff on a [[Fender Bass VI]] and admitted that he was \"very high on heroin when I wrote 'Back in the Saddle.' That riff just floated right through me.\"<ref name=\"diperna\">{{cite magazine |title=Aerosmith |magazine=[[Guitar World]] |date=April 1997 |last=Di Perna |first=Alan |volume=17 |issue=4 }}</ref> Brad Whitford plays the lead guitar part. \"Back in the Saddle\" also features one of the heaviest and noticeable bass lines by [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]. When the song is performed in concert, Steven Tyler often makes more noticeable lyrical and visible references to sex. Although the lyrics, composed by Tyler, were written with the simple idea of cowboys and sex, this song took on new meaning after Aerosmith reunited in 1984 and embarked on their Back in the Saddle tour. Today, the song remains a staple on classic rock radio and in concert. It is arguably one of the heaviest songs of Aerosmith's [[Top 40]] singles, and is cited by rock musicians [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[James Hetfield]] as among their favorite rock songs. Hamilton, who had written \"Sweet Emotion\" with Tyler, collaborated with the singer again on \"Sick as a Dog.\" In 1997 the bassist explained to ''Guitar World'', \"I think I came up with the verse part first.

The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, Richard Harnden or Abraham Jaquith. Butter was brought to Woburn as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is now Wilmington. Harnden settled in Reading, in an area that is now part of Wilmington. Jaquith settled in an area of Billerica that became part of Wilmington in 1740.\n\n[[Minutemen]] from Wilmington responded to the alarm on April 19, 1775 and fought at Merriam's Corner in [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Concord]].\n\nThe [[Middlesex Canal]] passed through Wilmington. Chartered in 1792, opened in 1803, it provided freight and passenger transport between the [[Merrimack River]] and Boston. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, Massachusetts was the acknowledged leader in hop production in North America. Middlesex County in particular was famous for its hop yards, and Wilmington was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.<ref>Tomlan, Michael, \"Tinged with Gold: Hop Culture in the U.S.\" Univ. of Georgia, 1992.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] was built in the 1820s, the canal became a primary means of transporting cotton to and from the mills. It was abandoned in 1852 after the construction of the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]].\n\nThe Boston and Lowell Railroad was built in 1835. The line is now the oldest operating rail line in the U.S. Wilmington is also served by the Haverhill Division (the old [[Boston and Maine Railroad|B&M]] Portland Division). A spur track known as the [[Wildcat Branch|Wildcat]] connects the Haverhill and Lowell divisions, following the path of the old Wilmington & Andover Railroad, the corporate ancestor of the Boston & Maine.\n\nWilmington is where the [[Baldwin apple]] was discovered.\n\nWilmington is also home to the Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern, which probably served as a stop on the [[underground railroad]] and now houses the Wilmington Town [[Museum]].\n\nSince World War II,  Wilmington's population has quadrupled. [[Interstate 93]], [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]], [[Route 129]] and [[Route 38]] run through town, and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] is about a mile south of Wilmington.\n\n==Geography==\nWilmington is located at {{Coord|42|33|N|71|10|W|type:city}} (42.560, \u221271.170).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|17.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|17.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.46%, is water.\n\nWilmington borders the towns of [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], and [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]].\n\nMuch of Wilmington was built on or still is [[wetlands]].

The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, Richard Harnden or Abraham Jaquith. Butter was brought to Woburn as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is now Wilmington. Harnden settled in Reading, in an area that is now part of Wilmington. Jaquith settled in an area of Billerica that became part of Wilmington in 1740.\n\n[[Minutemen]] from Wilmington responded to the alarm on April 19, 1775 and fought at Merriam's Corner in [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Concord]].\n\nThe [[Middlesex Canal]] passed through Wilmington. Chartered in 1792, opened in 1803, it provided freight and passenger transport between the [[Merrimack River]] and Boston. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, Massachusetts was the acknowledged leader in hop production in North America. Middlesex County in particular was famous for its hop yards, and Wilmington was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.<ref>Tomlan, Michael, \"Tinged with Gold: Hop Culture in the U.S.\" Univ. of Georgia, 1992.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] was built in the 1820s, the canal became a primary means of transporting cotton to and from the mills. It was abandoned in 1852 after the construction of the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]].\n\nThe Boston and Lowell Railroad was built in 1835. The line is now the oldest operating rail line in the U.S. Wilmington is also served by the Haverhill Division (the old [[Boston and Maine Railroad|B&M]] Portland Division). A spur track known as the [[Wildcat Branch|Wildcat]] connects the Haverhill and Lowell divisions, following the path of the old Wilmington & Andover Railroad, the corporate ancestor of the Boston & Maine.\n\nWilmington is where the [[Baldwin apple]] was discovered.\n\nWilmington is also home to the Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern, which probably served as a stop on the [[underground railroad]] and now houses the Wilmington Town [[Museum]].\n\nSince World War II,  Wilmington's population has quadrupled. [[Interstate 93]], [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]], [[Route 129]] and [[Route 38]] run through town, and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] is about a mile south of Wilmington.\n\n==Geography==\nWilmington is located at {{Coord|42|33|N|71|10|W|type:city}} (42.560, \u221271.170).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|17.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|17.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.46%, is water.\n\nWilmington borders the towns of [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], and [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]].\n\nMuch of Wilmington was built on or still is [[wetlands]].

Sherk attempted to take Penn down only once (in the first round), instead the fighters traded punches and leg kicks for the remainder of the fight. Penn landed jabs several times, utilizing his reach advantage over Sherk. In the closing seconds of the third round, Penn threw a punch and a hook that backed Sherk into the cage.

Sherk went down and Penn continued with strikes, but the round ended before the referee stopped the fight. However, Sherk was unable to continue and Penn was declared the victor by TKO (strikes).

To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage. Finally, no cornermen will be allowed to have Vaseline in the cage between rounds.

Penn looked noticeably in better physical shape than his previous outings at 155&nbsp;lbs and negated any sort of takedown offense from Florian the entire match despite his opponent's persistence in grappling and engaging the clinch.\n\nOn his feet, Penn avoided virtually any damage, constantly stuffing or evading any attempts of a left high kick, punches, or elbows from Florian when the two departed from the clinch. In a measured performance, Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the [[half guard]] position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the [[full mount]], where punches followed to continue the [[ground and pound]] assault from the [[BJJ]] specialist.\n\nA scramble ensued, where Florian gave up his back twice but was unable to escape Penn's mount, the second time Penn took his opponent's back, he looked to trap Florian's arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a [[rear naked choke]] at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.\n\nPenn fought [[Diego Sanchez]] for the [[UFC Lightweight Championship]] on December 12, 2009 at ''[[UFC 107]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/11471/bj-penn-vs-diego-sanchez-now-slated-for-ufc-107-on-december-12-in-memphis/ |title=BJ Penn vs. Diego Sanchez Now Slated for UFC 107 on December 12 in Memphis |publisher=MMAFrenzy.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> Penn negated virtually any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods of the match and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning for the duration of the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened up a huge cut on Sanchez's forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor's advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.\n\n{{quote|That right there, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest lightweight, in the history of the sport!|[[Joe Rogan]], post fight at [[UFC 107]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201015/http://profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-07 |title=BJ Penn: The Greatest Lightweight in the History of the Sport |publisher=ProFighting-fans.com |last=Nelson |first=Jake }}</ref>}}\n\nThe performance marked the third time Penn had successfully finished a fight in defending his UFC Lightweight Championship, setting a new record of lightweight title defenses, by breaking the previous record of two defenses by [[Jens Pulver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Penn-Dominates-Finishes-Sanchez-at-UFC-107-21501|title=Penn Dominates, Finishes Sanchez at UFC 107|publisher=sherdog.com |date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> Later during the post-fight press conference UFC President Dana White told the media he was proud of Penn's willingness to take MMA more seriously in his training when earlier he felt Penn had coasted through the UFC solely on natural talent.<ref name=\"Dana White Proud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|title=Dana White proud of new BJ Penn|publisher=FiveKnuckles.com|accessdate=December 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217095349/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|archivedate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BJPenn2.png|right|thumb|200px|Penn in November 2008.]] -->\n\n====Losing the title====\nPenn's next defense was on April 10, 2010 at ''[[UFC 112]]'' against [[Frankie Edgar]].

Sherk attempted to take Penn down only once (in the first round), instead the fighters traded punches and leg kicks for the remainder of the fight. Penn landed jabs several times, utilizing his reach advantage over Sherk. In the closing seconds of the third round, Penn threw a punch and a hook that backed Sherk into the cage. Sherk then ducked under another punch \u2013 possibly to shoot for a takedown \u2013 when he was hit in the head by a flush flying left knee from Penn. Sherk went down and Penn continued with strikes, but the round ended before the referee stopped the fight. However, Sherk was unable to continue and Penn was declared the victor by TKO (strikes).

To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage.

Penn looked noticeably in better physical shape than his previous outings at 155&nbsp;lbs and negated any sort of takedown offense from Florian the entire match despite his opponent's persistence in grappling and engaging the clinch.\n\nOn his feet, Penn avoided virtually any damage, constantly stuffing or evading any attempts of a left high kick, punches, or elbows from Florian when the two departed from the clinch. In a measured performance, Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the [[half guard]] position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the [[full mount]], where punches followed to continue the [[ground and pound]] assault from the [[BJJ]] specialist.\n\nA scramble ensued, where Florian gave up his back twice but was unable to escape Penn's mount, the second time Penn took his opponent's back, he looked to trap Florian's arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a [[rear naked choke]] at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.\n\nPenn fought [[Diego Sanchez]] for the [[UFC Lightweight Championship]] on December 12, 2009 at ''[[UFC 107]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/11471/bj-penn-vs-diego-sanchez-now-slated-for-ufc-107-on-december-12-in-memphis/ |title=BJ Penn vs. Diego Sanchez Now Slated for UFC 107 on December 12 in Memphis |publisher=MMAFrenzy.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> Penn negated virtually any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods of the match and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning for the duration of the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened up a huge cut on Sanchez's forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor's advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.\n\n{{quote|That right there, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest lightweight, in the history of the sport!|[[Joe Rogan]], post fight at [[UFC 107]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201015/http://profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-07 |title=BJ Penn: The Greatest Lightweight in the History of the Sport |publisher=ProFighting-fans.com |last=Nelson |first=Jake }}</ref>}}\n\nThe performance marked the third time Penn had successfully finished a fight in defending his UFC Lightweight Championship, setting a new record of lightweight title defenses, by breaking the previous record of two defenses by [[Jens Pulver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Penn-Dominates-Finishes-Sanchez-at-UFC-107-21501|title=Penn Dominates, Finishes Sanchez at UFC 107|publisher=sherdog.com |date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> Later during the post-fight press conference UFC President Dana White told the media he was proud of Penn's willingness to take MMA more seriously in his training when earlier he felt Penn had coasted through the UFC solely on natural talent.<ref name=\"Dana White Proud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|title=Dana White proud of new BJ Penn|publisher=FiveKnuckles.com|accessdate=December 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217095349/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|archivedate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BJPenn2.png|right|thumb|200px|Penn in November 2008.]] -->\n\n====Losing the title====\nPenn's next defense was on April 10, 2010 at ''[[UFC 112]]'' against [[Frankie Edgar]].

Pereira as [[principal (school)|Principal]]. The number of pupils was 17 girls and 33 boys, which has now grown to 1,450 students.\n\n==History==\nThe school building was inaugurated and blessed by Valerian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Gracias on 31 May 1960. Some of the [[Daughters of Mary]] Help of [[Christians]], Auxilium Convent, with Rev [[Sister Superior]], Bertha, attended the function held in the evening. There was a speech by the Cardinal followed by a few items of [[song]] and [[dance]] performed by the parishioners. The parish priest, [[Reverend|Rev]]. Fr Theophilus Lobo, due to whose labours the building owed its existence, gave the concluding speech.\n\nThe school started as a [[co-educational]] school, initially with Stds I-III and students, mostly [[parish]] children. With a view to establishing a [[convent school]] at Bandra, the superiors had appointed two sisters from Auxilium Convent, Sr Zita and Sr Regina, to teach in the parish school at [[Pali Hill]].\n\nThe new school opened its first [[academic year]] on 13 June 1960 with classes, Std. I, II, III (and lower and upper [[kindergartens]] which began functioning later). Half-day classes were held till the end of June, as the building was yet incomplete.\n\nInitially St Anne's High School was run as day school but when admissions increased greatly, the school was run in shifts.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of St. Anne's High School, every year new classes were added till the first batch of four SSC students appeared for the SSC Board Examination in 1966. The school secured cent percent results that year.\n\nIn Fr Trevor's initiatives included vocational guidance and [[counselling]], the Scouts and Guides, and other extra curricular activities like [[field sports]], [[elocution]], [[dramatics]], [[music]] and competitions, [[excursions]] and [[Summer camp|camp]]s. American Peace Corp helpers who conducted classes in [[social values]] and [[ethics]].\n\nThe newsletter was The Lion's Roar.\n\nAfter Msgr Malcolm Mendonca became principal, the school building was raised, the present [[basement]], the [[hall]] above, and the school office above the church extension, were built. Funds for the construction were collected by way of [[cultural]] programmes, fetes and raffles organised by the parish and the school. Msgr Malcolm Mendonca served until his transfer in 1982.\nMsgr Zachary D'souza took over as manager while Ms Greta Alvares continued as [[Headmistress]]. The school participated in inter-school competitions for [[elocution]], [[science]] projects, teaching-aids [[exhibitions]] and [[sports]] events.\n\nThe school was made a center for S.S.C Maharashtra State Board Examinations. A  [[laboratory]] and [[library]] were added.\n\nMs Congita Fernandes retired in 2002 after serving St. Anne's for 40 years.\n\n==The school today==\n* The Kindergarten section has two divisions each for the junior and senior sections comprising 250 students.\n* The Primary section has eight divisions, comprising 534 students.\n* The Secondary section of the institution is headed by the Headmistress, Ms Maria Parmar. The Supervisor of Staff is Mrs Premlata Pen.\n\nThe school has a [[laboratory]] and an [[audio-visual]] room for the students. The computer section is managed by three teachers to instruct students from Std I to Std X.\n\n==Houses==\nThe School has four houses: Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. Each house has a Captain and an assistant Captain. The school has a Head Boy and a Head Girl who are in charge of the Captains and the assistant Captains. There are two Sports Captains. The school also introduced the concept of Leaders who would support the captains. There was also a head leader which was appointed.\n\n==Examination results==\nOn 1 June 1966, the day the [[Secondary School Certificate|SSC examination]] was declared, the first batch of SSC students graduated with flying colours. The first SSC batch was in 1966 and they achieved a 100 per cent result. This was followed by 100 per cent in 1967 and 1968 too\nHowever St Anne's had to wait for a long time to achieve the same success that they had achieved in 1966 to 1968 the wait took them 35 years until 2003 when St Anne's again achieved a cent per cent result. The school achieved a cent per cent result the following year in 2004. The same success the school achieved in 2014, after the ten years of waiting.\n\n==School holidays==\nThe school remains closed on most Bank Holidays and on St. Anne's Feast Day which is on 26 July where there is a function organised by the school for the children. The summer vacation starts in May and ends in June,. There is also the [[Diwali]] and [[Christmas]] Vacations. The school has a function on [[Teacher's Day]] and [[Children's Day]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]],<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2002/feb/09sld1.htm</ref> Indian film actor, director and producer\n* [[Aamna Shariff]], actor, fashion designer\n* [[Sangeeta Bijlani]], actress and wife of Former Cricket Captain Azharuddin\n\n==Principals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Theophilus Lobo as Rector and Fr Joe D. Pereira as [[principal (school)|Principal]]. The number of pupils was 17 girls and 33 boys, which has now grown to 1,450 students.\n\n==History==\nThe school building was inaugurated and blessed by Valerian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Gracias on 31 May 1960. Some of the [[Daughters of Mary]] Help of [[Christians]], Auxilium Convent, with Rev [[Sister Superior]], Bertha, attended the function held in the evening. There was a speech by the Cardinal followed by a few items of [[song]] and [[dance]] performed by the parishioners. The parish priest, [[Reverend|Rev]]. Fr Theophilus Lobo, due to whose labours the building owed its existence, gave the concluding speech.\n\nThe school started as a [[co-educational]] school, initially with Stds I-III and students, mostly [[parish]] children. With a view to establishing a [[convent school]] at Bandra, the superiors had appointed two sisters from Auxilium Convent, Sr Zita and Sr Regina, to teach in the parish school at [[Pali Hill]].\n\nThe new school opened its first [[academic year]] on 13 June 1960 with classes, Std. I, II, III (and lower and upper [[kindergartens]] which began functioning later). Half-day classes were held till the end of June, as the building was yet incomplete.\n\nInitially St Anne's High School was run as day school but when admissions increased greatly, the school was run in shifts.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of St. Anne's High School, every year new classes were added till the first batch of four SSC students appeared for the SSC Board Examination in 1966. The school secured cent percent results that year.\n\nIn Fr Trevor's initiatives included vocational guidance and [[counselling]], the Scouts and Guides, and other extra curricular activities like [[field sports]], [[elocution]], [[dramatics]], [[music]] and competitions, [[excursions]] and [[Summer camp|camp]]s. American Peace Corp helpers who conducted classes in [[social values]] and [[ethics]].\n\nThe newsletter was The Lion's Roar.\n\nAfter Msgr Malcolm Mendonca became principal, the school building was raised, the present [[basement]], the [[hall]] above, and the school office above the church extension, were built. Funds for the construction were collected by way of [[cultural]] programmes, fetes and raffles organised by the parish and the school. Msgr Malcolm Mendonca served until his transfer in 1982.\nMsgr Zachary D'souza took over as manager while Ms Greta Alvares continued as [[Headmistress]]. The school participated in inter-school competitions for [[elocution]], [[science]] projects, teaching-aids [[exhibitions]] and [[sports]] events.\n\nThe school was made a center for S.S.C Maharashtra State Board Examinations. A  [[laboratory]] and [[library]] were added.\n\nMs Congita Fernandes retired in 2002 after serving St. Anne's for 40 years.\n\n==The school today==\n* The Kindergarten section has two divisions each for the junior and senior sections comprising 250 students.\n* The Primary section has eight divisions, comprising 534 students.\n* The Secondary section of the institution is headed by the Headmistress, Ms Maria Parmar. The Supervisor of Staff is Mrs Premlata Pen.\n\nThe school has a [[laboratory]] and an [[audio-visual]] room for the students. The computer section is managed by three teachers to instruct students from Std I to Std X.\n\n==Houses==\nThe School has four houses: Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. Each house has a Captain and an assistant Captain. The school has a Head Boy and a Head Girl who are in charge of the Captains and the assistant Captains. There are two Sports Captains. The school also introduced the concept of Leaders who would support the captains. There was also a head leader which was appointed.\n\n==Examination results==\nOn 1 June 1966, the day the [[Secondary School Certificate|SSC examination]] was declared, the first batch of SSC students graduated with flying colours. The first SSC batch was in 1966 and they achieved a 100 per cent result. This was followed by 100 per cent in 1967 and 1968 too\nHowever St Anne's had to wait for a long time to achieve the same success that they had achieved in 1966 to 1968 the wait took them 35 years until 2003 when St Anne's again achieved a cent per cent result. The school achieved a cent per cent result the following year in 2004. The same success the school achieved in 2014, after the ten years of waiting.\n\n==School holidays==\nThe school remains closed on most Bank Holidays and on St. Anne's Feast Day which is on 26 July where there is a function organised by the school for the children. The summer vacation starts in May and ends in June,. There is also the [[Diwali]] and [[Christmas]] Vacations. The school has a function on [[Teacher's Day]] and [[Children's Day]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]],<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2002/feb/09sld1.htm</ref> Indian film actor, director and producer\n* [[Aamna Shariff]], actor, fashion designer\n* [[Sangeeta Bijlani]], actress and wife of Former Cricket Captain Azharuddin\n\n==Principals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]].

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life.
