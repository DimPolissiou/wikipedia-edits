Ray dates for fun, mostly going out with traveling salesmen passing through town, and neither she nor her dates are interested in any permanent attachment. An exception is Kurt Shendler, who owns a bicycle shop near Mr. Schmidt's shop and aspires to get into the automobile business. Kurt is in love with Ray and asks her to marry him, but she refuses because while she likes Kurt, she doesn't return his romantic feelings.\n\nWhile visiting the train station with Kurt, Ray meets Walter Saxel (John Boles) and the two fall for each other at first sight. Walter soon confesses to Ray that he is actually engaged to another woman in town, Corinne, who comes from a wealthy background and whose mother is friends with his own mother. Nevertheless he has fallen in love with Ray, and asks her to meet him at a local band concert that he will be attending with his mother. Walter hopes to introduce Ray to his mother and perhaps get her approval of the relationship. On the day of the concert, Ray is late arriving because her younger half-sister Freda is suicidal over her boyfriend, Hugo, leaving town. Freda begs Ray to go after Hugo and stop him, threatening to throw herself out a window if Ray does not help. By the time Ray has dealt with Freda's situation and gotten to the concert, it is over, and Ray cannot find Walter or his mother in the departing crowds. Walter, thinking she stood him up, writes her an angry letter and marries Corinne.\n\nSeveral years later, Walter, now a rising young financier on [[Wall Street]], runs into Ray who is single and working in New York City. The two renew their acquaintance and realize they still love each other, although Walter is still married and has two children. Walter sets Ray up in an inexpensive apartment and gets her to give up her job so she will be free to see him when he has time. However, his work, family and social commitments sometimes keep him away for long periods of time, causing Ray to feel lonely and isolated. After Walter takes an extended trip to Europe with his wife, leaving Ray alone with insufficient money to live on, she breaks up with him and accepts a proposal from Kurt, who has become a rich automobile manufacturer. Walter goes to Cincinnati to convince her not to marry Kurt and they resume their previous relationship.\n\nYears pass, and Walter has become a wealthy and prominent financier. When he travels he now brings Ray along, although they must keep their relationship hidden and avoid being seen in public together, meaning Ray spends much of her time alone. Ray is the target of gossip and is hated by Walter's adult children, who regard Ray as a gold digger. Walter's son Dick tells Ray to get out of his family's life, but his father Walter walks in on the conversation and tells his son to be more understanding or at least to mind his own business. That night, Walter suffers a massive [[stroke]] and dies shortly thereafter. Just before Walter dies, he asks Dick to telephone Ray's number and hears her voice over the phone one last time. Dick, who now understands his father's feelings for Ray, goes to see her and offers to continue to support her. He finds her distraught over Walter's death and also learns that his father had been paying her only a very small amount per month, thus proving that she stayed in the relationship for love, not money. After Dick leaves, Ray dies looking at Walter's picture.\n\n==The filmography and production style==\n[[File:John M Stahl - Feb 1922 EH.jpg|thumb|174x174px|A picture of the director John Stahl]]\n''Back Street'' tells the story of Ray Schmidt in a direct fashion, reflecting the very simple perspective of a woman of her kind in the 1930s. The screenplay writers, [[Gladys Lehman]] and [[Fannie Hurst]], wrote the story in straightforward chronological order. Director [[John M. Stahl]] had a clear, easily comprehensible directing style, making sure that scenes lasted a long time and including mainly far-shots and relatively few close-up scenes. These techniques increase the effect of objectivity in the film and places its emphasis on the tragic aspects of the story itself rather than on its emotional effect on the characters. In certain shots of the film, Stahl only uses a steady camera set up, and in others he allows major movement of the camera. \n\nThe scenes are connected with straight fluency, having strong causal connections between each other. The cinematographer, [[Karl Freund]], incorporated pictorial techniques, such as employment of a moving camera on set or changes in lighting, to make the message of the scene more apparent. Freund created the \u201c[[Unchained Camera]]\u201d, which was revolutionary in its time. A new variety and range of shots were offered with this style of shooting. In ''Back Street'' there were few moments of movement in scenes, but when there was movement, the camera was shaky. This most likely occurred because the camera was unchained in Freund\u2019s technique. \n \nThe performances of the actors were restrained. The portrayals of Ray by Irene Dunne and Walter by John Boles are simple and untheatrical, offering a real-life feel. Unlike many films of this era, ''Back Street'' does not seem like a filmed stage play, but a [[slice-of-life]] that was relatable and revealing of the truth of many women's lives during the bleak period of the [[Great Depression]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Ray Schmidt\n* [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] as Walter Saxel \n* [[George Meeker]] as Kurt Shendler \n* [[ZaSu Pitts]] as Mrs. Dole \n* [[June Clyde]] as Freda Schmidt \n* [[William Bakewell]] as Richard \"Dick\" Saxel \n* [[Arletta Duncan]] as Beth Saxel \n* [[Shirley Grey]] as Francine \n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Corinne Saxel\n* [[Paul Weigel]] as Adolph Schmidt \n* [[Jane Darwell]] as Mrs. Schmidt \n* [[James Donlan]] as  Phothero\n* [[Walter Catlett]] as  Bakeless \n* [[Robert McWade]] as Uncle Felix\n* [[Maude Turner Gordon]] (uncredited) as Mrs. Saxel (Walter's mother)\n\n==External links==\n* {{tcmdb title|id=67910|title=Back Street}}\n* {{Amg movie|84265|Back Street}}\n* {{IMDb title|0022651}}\n* [//movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E7D91231E633A2575AC2A96E9C946394D6CF Back Street, film review in The New York Times by [[Mordaunt Hall]], August 29, 1932]\n\n{{John M.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]].

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the nine Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=2019-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]\nOn March 2, 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

Four smaller plazas, San Mart\u00edn, Chile, Italia, and Espa\u00f1a, are located 2 blocks off each corner of Independence Plaza.

On average, 50% of the offspring of an affected person will inherit the disorder, regardless of gender.\n\nOccasionally, however, a solitary case can emerge in a family with no prior history of the disorder due to the occurrence of a new [[mutation]] (often referred to as a sporadic, spontaneous or de novo mutation).\n\n==Diagnosis==\n=== Classification ===\nILDS: Q84.520 \nICD-10:  Q84.5\n\nPachyonychia congenita consists of five sub-types, each named after its corresponding genetic mutation and each associated with distinguishing clinical features:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/pachyonychia-congenita/|title=Pachyonychia Congenita - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|work=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>\n\n# PC-K6a is caused by a mutation in the [[Keratin 6A|''KRT6A'' gene]] and more often associated with oral [[Leukoplakia|leukokeratosis]] and poor feeding in infants.\n# PC-K6b is caused by a mutation in the [[Keratin 6B|''KRT6B'' gene]] and more commonly associated with an increased age of onset (>14 years).\n#PC-K6c is caused by a mutation in the [[Keratin 6C|''KRT6C'' gen]]<nowiki/>e and is the least common sub-type.
