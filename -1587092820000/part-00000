The player assumes control of a [[starship]] named the TRY-Z, as it must prevent the Fourth Empire from taking over the entire [[galaxy]]. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies using either a [[Laser|laser shot]] or a limited supply of [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking missiles]], all while avoiding collision with projectiles or obstacles and making sure the ship's energy meter doesn't fully deplete. It ran on the [[Sega Y Board]] arcade system.\n\nCreated by the same group of developers that later went on to form [[Sega AM1]], ''Galaxy Force'' was developed specifically to show off the capabilities of the Sega Y hardware with its usage of large, detailed backgrounds and massive amount of on-screen [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game is part of Sega's \"super scaler\" line of [[Arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]], alongside titles such as ''[[Out Run]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]''. It was largely inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]''. The soundtrack was composed jointly by Katsuhiro Hayashi and Kouichi Namaki, both of who previously created the music for ''[[Thunder Blade]]''. The game came in three different cabinet styles; a standard upright, a \"Deluxe\" machine, and a \"Super Deluxe\" version that could twist and turn the player around. Almost immediately after the game's release, Sega published an updated version titled ''Galaxy Force II'' which added two new levels and other minor additions.\n\n''Galaxy Force'' was critically-acclaimed, being praised for its graphics, gameplay, presentation, music and hardware capabilities, considered to be visually impressive for the time period. It was ported to several platforms, including the [[Master System]], [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Commodore 64]], as well as being released under several different Sega classic game re-release labels such as ''[[Sega Ages]]''. A high-definition remake titled ''Galaxy Force Neo Classic'' was released for the PlayStation 2 in ''Galaxy Force II Special Extended Edition'', alongside the original, which featured smoothed-out graphics and additional visual effects. With the exception of the Master System version, all home versions of the game are based on ''Galaxy Force II''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:ARC Galaxy Force (Galaxy Force_II).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.|alt=The player ship flies over a fiery planet surface.

The player assumes control of a starship named the TRY-Z, in its mission to vanquish the Fourth Empire before they take over the entire galaxy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Gameplay involves maneuvering the TRY-Z through six different stages, referred to as \"worlds\" in-game, all while shooting down incoming enemies and avoiding collision with either them, their projectiles, or an obstacle such as a wall.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> The TRY-Z is equipped with two weapons to destroy enemies; a standard [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] laser shot, and a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles that automatically track down targets.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> Additional missiles can be found throughout specific portions of levels.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> A shield is displayed at the bottom left of the screen that will deplete should the TRY-Z collide with an obstacle or projectile.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The TRY-Z has an energy meter at the bottom of the screen that depletes as the level progresses; energy is decreased by firing weapons and coming into contact with obstacles or projectiles.

The nation's 36th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] from 1953 to 1961, he came to national prominence as a [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] and [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[California]]. After five years in the White House that saw the conclusion to the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[d\u00e9tente]] with the USSR and China, and the establishment of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], he became the only president to resign from the office.\n\nNixon was born into a poor family in a small town in [[Southern California]]. He graduated from [[Duke University School of Law]] in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]] moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He served on active duty in the Navy Reserve during World War II. He was elected to the House of Representatives in [[1946 California's 12th congressional district election|1946]]. His pursuit of the [[Hiss Case]] established his reputation as a leading anti-Communist which elevated him to national prominence. In [[1950 United States Senate election in California|1950]], he was elected to the Senate. He was the running mate of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]], serving for eight years in that capacity. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in [[1960 United States presidential election#General election|1960]], narrowly losing to [[John F. Kennedy]]. Nixon then lost a race for governor of California to [[Pat Brown]] in [[1962 California gubernatorial election|1962]]. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[George Wallace]] in a close election.\n\nNixon ended American involvement in the [[war in Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. [[Nixon's visit to China]] in 1972 eventually led to [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations|diplomatic relations between the two nations]], and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from federal control to state control. He imposed wage and price controls for 90 days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools, established the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and began the [[War on Cancer]]. He also presided over the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was re-elected in one of the largest electoral landslides in American history in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] when he defeated [[George McGovern]].\n\nIn his second term, Nixon ordered [[Operation Nickel Grass|an airlift]] to resupply Israeli losses in the [[Yom Kippur War]], leading to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] at home. By late 1973, the [[Watergate scandal]] escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office\u2014the only time an American president has done so. After his resignation, he was issued [[Pardon of Richard Nixon|a controversial pardon]] by his successor, [[Gerald Ford]]. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote his memoirs and nine other books and undertook many foreign trips, thereby rehabilitating his image into that of an elder statesman and leading expert on foreign affairs. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon|died four days later]] at age 81.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRichard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in [[Yorba Linda, California]], in a house built by his father.{{sfn|NPS, Nixon Birthplace}}{{sfn|Ferris|p=209}} His parents were [[Hannah Milhous Nixon|Hannah (Milhous) Nixon]] and [[Francis A.

In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station.{{sfn|Aitken|p=21}} Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=41}} Richard was twelve years old when a spot was found on his lung.

At Whittier, Nixon suffered his first election defeat when he lost his bid for student body president. He often rose at 4&nbsp;a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207.{{sfn|Black|pp=20\u201323}}\n\n=== College and law school education ===\n\nNixon was offered a tuition grant to attend [[Harvard University]], but Harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store.

He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm.{{sfn|Gellman|p=15}} Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society.{{sfn|Black|pp=24\u201325}} In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=61}} In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief.

A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center. He visited [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] and [[Hanoi]] in [[French Indochina]].{{sfn|Aitken|pp=225\u2013227}} On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=342}}\n\nBiographer Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional years, said of his vice presidency:\n{{quote|Eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office.

Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. The [[25th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had not yet been proposed, and the Vice President had no formal power to act. Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=256\u2013258}} According to Nixon biographer [[Stephen Ambrose]], Nixon had \"earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis&nbsp;... he made no attempt to seize power\".{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=375\u2013376}}\n[[File:Kitchen debate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Vice President Nixon and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] speak as the press looks on in part of what came to be known as the [[Kitchen Debate]], July 24, 1959]]\n\nHis spirits buoyed, Nixon sought a second term, but some of Eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, saying it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 [[New Hampshire primary]] election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=237\u2013241}} Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the [[1956 United States presidential election|November 1956 election]].{{sfn|Parmet|p=294}}\n\nIn early 1957, Nixon undertook another major foreign trip, this time to Africa.

These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis.

The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970.

Through employment of linkage, they hoped to change the nature and course of U.S. foreign policy, including U.S. nuclear disarmament and arms control policy, and to separate them from those practiced by Nixon's predecessors. They also intended, through linkage, to make U.S. arms control policy part of d\u00e9tente{{nbsp}}... His policy of linkage had in fact failed.

During the Nixon administration, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East, particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia.{{r|Hanhim\u00e4ki-Small}} The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the U.S. should encourage it. The president believed that\u2014except during the [[Suez Crisis]]\u2014the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term\u2014for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.{{efn|name=Jewish vote}}\n\nOn October 6, 1973, an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, supported with arms and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|negotiating a truce]], Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.\u2013USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to [[DEFCON]]3,<ref name=\"fas-defcon\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/defcon.htm|title=DEFCON DEFense CONdition|work=fas.org|access-date=June 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617123557/https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/defcon.htm|archive-date=June 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war.

As part of his \"[[New Federalism]]\" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.{{sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=431\u2013432}} In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.{{r|Bowles-Small}} With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at [[Camp David]]. He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=399\u2013400}} Bowles points out,\n<blockquote>by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents&nbsp;... to criticize him.

Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders\u2014both white and black\u2014to determine how to [[School integration in the United States|integrate]] local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary [[George Shultz]]. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing]] of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance.

The Democratic \"[[Solid South]]\" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions. Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] but had alienated more moderate Southerners. Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy. Through his first term, he pursued a [[Southern Strategy]] with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the [[civil rights movement]]. He nominated two Southern conservatives, [[Clement Haynsworth]] and [[G.

Those activities included \"dirty tricks,\" such as bugging the offices of political opponents, and the harassment of activist groups and political figures. The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into the Democratic party headquarters at the [[Watergate complex]] in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' picked up on the story; reporters [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]] relied on an informant known as \"[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]\"\u2014later revealed to be [[W. Mark Felt|Mark Felt]], associate director at the [[FBI]]\u2014to link the men to the Nixon administration. Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading. A series of revelations made it clear that the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|Committee to Re-elect President Nixon]], and later the White House, was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats. Senior aides such as [[White House Counsel]] [[John Dean]] faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.{{sfn|Nixon Library, President}}{{sfn|''The Washington Post'', The Post Investigates}}{{sfn|''The Washington Post'', The Government Acts}}\n[[File:Impeach Nixon retouched.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator demanding Nixon's [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]], October 1973]]\n\nIn July 1973, White House aide [[Alexander Butterfield]] testified [[Perjury|under oath]] to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system and recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office.

In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as [[Watergate tapes#The \"smoking gun\" tape|the \"Smoking Gun Tape\"]] on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had had a lapse of memory.{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=414\u2013416}} Senate Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]], Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], and House Minority Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] met with Nixon soon after.

The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, even though it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon, but then agreed to do so. Ford insisted on a statement of contrition, but Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a \"full, free, and absolute pardon\", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:\n{{quote|I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy.

In a 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, historian Paul Charles Milazzo points to Nixon's creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and to his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]], stating that \"though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure\".{{r|Milazzo-Small}} Nixon himself did not consider the environmental advances he made in office an important part of his legacy; some historians contend that his choices were driven more by political expediency than any strong [[environmentalism]].<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nNixon saw his policies on Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union as central to his place in history.{{r|Hanhim\u00e4ki-Small}} Nixon's onetime opponent [[George McGovern]] commented in 1983, \"President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War{{nbsp}}II [...] With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history.\"{{sfn|Greider|1983-10-10}} Political scientist [[Jussi Hanhim\u00e4ki]] disagrees, saying that Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the [[Cold War]] policy of [[containment]] by diplomatic, rather than military means.{{r|Hanhim\u00e4ki-Small}} Historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] concludes that \"Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena.

The nation's 36th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] from 1953 to 1961, he came to national prominence as a [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] and [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[California]]. After five years in the White House that saw the conclusion to the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[d\u00e9tente]] with the USSR and China, and the establishment of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], he became the only president to resign from the office.\n\nNixon was born into a poor family in a small town in [[Southern California]]. He graduated from [[Duke University School of Law]] in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]] moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He served on active duty in the Navy Reserve during World War II. He was elected to the House of Representatives in [[1946 California's 12th congressional district election|1946]]. His pursuit of the [[Hiss Case]] established his reputation as a leading anti-Communist which elevated him to national prominence. In [[1950 United States Senate election in California|1950]], he was elected to the Senate. He was the running mate of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]], serving for eight years in that capacity. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in [[1960 United States presidential election#General election|1960]], narrowly losing to [[John F. Kennedy]]. Nixon then lost a race for governor of California to [[Pat Brown]] in [[1962 California gubernatorial election|1962]]. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[George Wallace]] in a close election.\n\nNixon ended American involvement in the [[war in Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. [[Nixon's visit to China]] in 1972 eventually led to [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations|diplomatic relations between the two nations]], and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from federal control to state control. He imposed wage and price controls for 90 days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools, established the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and began the [[War on Cancer]]. He also presided over the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was re-elected in one of the largest electoral landslides in American history in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] when he defeated [[George McGovern]].\n\nIn his second term, Nixon ordered [[Operation Nickel Grass|an airlift]] to resupply Israeli losses in the [[Yom Kippur War]], leading to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] at home. By late 1973, the [[Watergate scandal]] escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office\u2014the only time an American president has done so. After his resignation, he was issued [[Pardon of Richard Nixon|a controversial pardon]] by his successor, [[Gerald Ford]]. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote his memoirs and nine other books and undertook many foreign trips, thereby rehabilitating his image into that of an elder statesman and leading expert on foreign affairs. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon|died four days later]] at age 81.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRichard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in [[Yorba Linda, California]], in a house built by his father.{{sfn|NPS, Nixon Birthplace}}{{sfn|Ferris|p=209}} His parents were [[Hannah Milhous Nixon|Hannah (Milhous) Nixon]] and [[Francis A. Nixon]]. His mother was a [[Quaker]], and his father converted from [[Methodism]] to the Quaker faith. Through his mother, Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], who was also an ancestor of [[Ezra Cornell]], the founder of [[Cornell University]], as well as of [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Gates]].<ref>Reitwiesner, William Addams ''The Ancestors of Senator John Forbes Kerry (b. 1943) '' http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427081750/http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html |date=April 27, 2019 }} Accessed August 31, 2016</ref>\n[[File:Nixon child.jpeg|thumb|left|Nixon (second from right) makes his newspaper debut in 1916, contributing five cents to a fund for war orphans. His brother [[Donald Nixon|Donald]] is to his right.]]\n\nNixon's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909\u201333), [[Donald Nixon|Donald]] (1914\u201387), Arthur (1918\u201325), and [[Edward Nixon|Edward]] (1930\u20132019).{{sfn|Nixon Library, Childhood}} Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] or legendary Britain; Richard, for example, was named after [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]].{{sfn|Aitken|p=11}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.com/genealogy/president-nixon.html|title=Nixon Genealogy\u2014President Richard Nixon Family History|work=archives.com|access-date=November 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924072604/http://www.archives.com/genealogy/president-nixon.html|archive-date=September 24, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: \"We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it\".{{sfn|Aitken|p=12}} The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to [[Whittier, California]]. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station.{{sfn|Aitken|p=21}} Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=41}} Richard was twelve years old when a spot was found on his lung. With a family history of [[tuberculosis]], he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.{{sfn|Aitken|p=27}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon HS Yearbook.jpg|left|thumb|Nixon at [[Whittier High School]], 1930]]\n[[File:Richard Nixon Birthplace (43697890105).jpg|thumb|left|Nixon's birthplace in [[Yorba Linda, California]]]]\n\nRichard attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class.{{sfn|Black|p=16}} His parents believed that attending [[Whittier High School]] had caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of it in 1933), so they sent Richard to the larger [[Fullerton Union High School]].{{sfn|Morris|p=89}}{{sfn|Black|pp=17\u201319}} He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year, and received excellent grades. Later, he lived with an aunt in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] during the week.{{sfn|Morris|p=91}} He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, though he was rarely used in games.{{sfn|Morris|p=92}} He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, \"Remember, speaking is conversation...don't shout at people. Talk to them. Converse with them.\"{{sfn|Aitken|p=28}} Nixon said he tried to use a conversational tone as much as possible.{{sfn|Aitken|p=28}}\n\nAt the start of his junior year in September 1928, Richard's parents permitted him to transfer to Whittier High School. At Whittier, Nixon suffered his first election defeat when he lost his bid for student body president. He often rose at 4&nbsp;a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207.{{sfn|Black|pp=20\u201323}}\n\n=== College and law school education ===\n\nNixon was offered a tuition grant to attend [[Harvard University]], but Harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended [[Whittier College]] with his expenses covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather.{{sfn|Black|pp=23\u201324}} Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm.{{sfn|Gellman|p=15}} Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society.{{sfn|Black|pp=24\u201325}} In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=61}} In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. They broke up in 1935.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=58\u201363}}\n\nAfter graduating ''[[Latin honors#North America|summa cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received a full scholarship to attend [[Duke University School of Law]].{{sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor}} The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=33\u201334}} It paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations.{{sfn|Aitken|p=67}} The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=33\u201334}} Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association,{{sfn|Parmet|p=81}} inducted into the [[Order of the Coif]],{{sfn|Nixon Library, Family Collection Guide}} and graduated third in his class in June 1937.{{sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor}}\n\n== Early career and marriage ==\n\nAfter graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts.{{sfn|Aitken|p=76}} Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the [[State Bar of California|California bar]] in 1937. He began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert and Bewley,{{sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor}} working on [[Commercial law|commercial litigation]] for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on [[Will (law)|wills]].{{sfn|Aitken|pp=79\u201382}} In later years, Nixon proudly said he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women.{{sfn|Morris|p=193}} In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in [[La Habra, California]],{{sfn|Black|p=44}} and became a full partner in the firm the following year.{{sfn|Black|p=43}}\n\nIn January 1938 Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of ''[[The Dark Tower (play)|The Dark Tower]]''. There he played opposite a high school teacher named [[Pat Nixon|Thelma \"Pat\" Ryan]].{{sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor}} Nixon described it in his memoirs as \"a case of [[love at first sight]]\"{{sfn|Nixon|1978|p=23}}\u2014for Nixon only, as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=93, 99}} Once they began their courtship, Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal. They wed in a small ceremony on June 21, 1940. After a honeymoon in Mexico, the Nixons began their married life in Whittier.{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=100\u2013101}} They had two daughters, [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia]] (born 1946) and [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]] (born 1948).{{sfn|Nixon Library, Nixon Family}}\n\n== Military service ==\n\n[[File:NH 84098 Lieutenant Commander Richard Milhous Nixon, USN.jpeg|thumb|Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon, United States Navy (circa 1945)]]\n\nIn January 1942 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon took a job at the [[Office of Price Administration]].{{sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor}} In his political campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier.{{sfn|Morris|pp=124\u2013126}} He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later applied to join the [[United States Navy]].{{sfn|Kornitzer|pp=143\u2013144}} As a birthright Quaker, he could have by law claimed exemption from [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. In spite of that, Nixon sought a commission in the Navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenant junior grade]] in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.<ref name=\"navy.mil\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-n/nixon-richard.html |title=Naval Profiles: Richard Milhous Nixon |date=February 18, 2015 |website=Naval History and Heritage Command |publisher=U.S. Navy |access-date=March 6, 2017 |quote=From August through December of 1944, Nixon was assigned to Fleet Air Wing EIGHT.

Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=256\u2013258}} According to Nixon biographer [[Stephen Ambrose]], Nixon had \"earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis&nbsp;... he made no attempt to seize power\".{{sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=375\u2013376}}\n[[File:Kitchen debate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Vice President Nixon and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] speak as the press looks on in part of what came to be known as the [[Kitchen Debate]], July 24, 1959]]\n\nHis spirits buoyed, Nixon sought a second term, but some of Eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, saying it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 [[New Hampshire primary]] election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=237\u2013241}} Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the [[1956 United States presidential election|November 1956 election]].{{sfn|Parmet|p=294}}\n\nIn early 1957, Nixon undertook another major foreign trip, this time to Africa.

More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|negotiating a truce]], Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.\u2013USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused.

As part of his \"[[New Federalism]]\" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.{{sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=431\u2013432}} In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.{{r|Bowles-Small}} With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at [[Camp David]].

The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, even though it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon, but then agreed to do so. Ford insisted on a statement of contrition, but Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a \"full, free, and absolute pardon\", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:\n{{quote|I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy.

Nixon also took [[dilantin]], recommended by [[Jack Dreyfus]]. That medicine is usually prescribed for anti-seizure attacks, but in Nixon's case it was to battle depression. His periodic overindulgences, especially during stressful times such as during [[Apollo 13]], concerned Price and others, including then-advisor Ehrlichman and long-time [[valet]] [[Manolo Sanchez (Nixon staff member)|Manolo Sanchez]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/john-farrell-nixon-book-excerpt-214954 | title=The Year Nixon Fell Apart | access-date=July 15, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607015351/https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/john-farrell-nixon-book-excerpt-214954 | archive-date=June 7, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> Author and former British politician [[David Owen#Selected publications|David Owen]] deemed Nixon an alcoholic.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/david-owen-lessons-in-removing-politicians-from-public-office-891446.html| title=David Owen: Lessons in removing politicians from public office| date=August 12, 2008| access-date=July 15, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715193824/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/david-owen-lessons-in-removing-politicians-from-public-office-891446.html| archive-date=July 15, 2019| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/28/politicians-hubris-medical-condition|title = A doctor writes: Politicians' pride is a medical disorder|newspaper = The Guardian|date = March 28, 2009|last1 = Boseley|first1 = Sarah|access-date = July 15, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190715195739/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/28/politicians-hubris-medical-condition|archive-date = July 15, 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nBiographer [[Elizabeth Drew]] summarized Nixon as a \"smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents\".{{sfn|Drew|p=151}} In his account of the Nixon presidency, author [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] described Nixon as \"a strange man of uncomfortable shyness, who functioned best alone with his thoughts\".{{sfn|Reeves|p=12}} Nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality, Reeves argues:\n<blockquote>He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them&nbsp;... He clung to the idea of being \"tough\". He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.{{sfn|Reeves|p=13}}</blockquote>\n\nNixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president. Even [[Bebe Rebozo]], by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name. Nixon said of this,\n<blockquote>Even with close friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding this and that and the other thing\u2014saying, \"Gee, I couldn't sleep&nbsp;...\" I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts&nbsp;... [and] reveal their inner psyche\u2014whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way.{{sfn|Greene}}</blockquote>\nWhen Nixon was told that most Americans felt they did not know him even at the end of his career, he replied, \"Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know.\"{{sfn|Greene}}<!-- Also printed in ''Chicago Tribute'' with fee for article [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/111527613.html?dids=111527613:111527613&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+26%2C+2002&author=Bob+Greene&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=What+Nixon's+best+friend+couldn't+buy&pqatl=google here] -->\n\n==Books==\n* Nixon, Richard M.

The community was named for General Charles W. Scofield, a timber contractor and local mine official. It is the smallest incorporated area in Utah by population.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Scofield Cemetery.jpg|left|thumb|Scofield Cemetery and some of its wooden gravestones]]\nThe town of Scofield is situated on high ground two miles south of the reservoir of the same name, the oldest and largest of the major impoundments on the [[Wasatch Plateau]]. Once the most populous community in Carbon County, Scofield has shrunk to only a few permanent residents. What has slowed the continual decline has become outsiders constructing summer vacation homes. The old brick school stands empty at the upper end of town, and there are abandoned buildings scattered through what was once the business district. Only the cemetery on a hill to the east suggests that this was once a community of some size. Visitors to the cemetery quickly become aware of the diverse ethnicity that populated the town.<ref name=edge>{{cite book | last = Geary | first = Edward A. | title = The proper edge of the sky: the high plateau country of Utah | date = March 12, 2002 | publisher = [[University of Utah Press]] | isbn = 0-87480-409-4}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement===\nDue to the luxuriant growth of the native grasses indigenous to this region, this valley was first utilized as pastures for the immense herds of cattle that came from [[Utah Valley]]. Among the first settlers of this region were S. J. Harkness, T. H. Thomas, William Burrows, O. G. Kimball, D. D. Green, A. H. Earll, R. McKecheney, who were attracted by the immense ranges for their cattle.<ref name=disast>{{cite book | last = Dilley | first = James W. | title = History of the Scofield mine disaster| url = https://archive.org/details/historyscofield00dillgoog }}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of coal and coming of the railroad===\n[[Coal]] was discovered in the valley in 1875, and two years later a small mine was opened on the western slopes of the canyon, with the coal transported out along narrow roads. The winter of 1877 came early and was very severe, stranding the miners in the coal pit and keeping them snowbound until the following February. The ordeal led the miners to name their forced camp \"[[Winter Quarters, Utah|Winter Quarters]]\". It became one of the first commercial coal mines in the state. Most of the first miners at the Winter Quarters were [[Mormon]] converts from the coal districts of [[Wales]], [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. One of them, David Williams, leased the Winter Quarters Mine from the Pleasant Valley Coal Company from 1880 to 1885, operating in the dual capacity of mine manager and [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of the local [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]].  When the [[Rio Grande Western Railway]] acquired the coal company, they undertook the development of a new mine on Mud Creek, a mile from Winter Quarters, much to the chagrin of Williams, who protested that the new mine infringed on his lease. Because Bishop Williams controlled the Mormon miners, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company brought in [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese laborers]] to work the Mud Creek mine. Soon a large contingent of [[Finns]] were recruited, along with [[Italians|Italian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and other [[Scandinavia]]n workers.<ref name=edge/>\n\nAs coal veins commenced to be worked, it was not long before the discoverers found out that the supply seemed inexhaustible. The railway companies finding that the coal fields were of such magnitude and covered so much territory, began to survey for practicable routes to reach the coal. The route through [[Spanish Fork River|Spanish Fork Canyon]] was finally decided upon, and a [[narrow-gauge railroad]] was built into Scofield. Before the railroad was completed, winter set in, and the last few miles were laid upon the ice and snow as it was impossible to find the ground due to the snow drifts. The [[Union Pacific]] Coal Company claimed all of the land on the town site, and those building a home were compelled to lease the spot of ground desired from this company. Not knowing how long they would be permitted to remain as laborers in the mines, the men did not build elaborate homes, as they knew that should the work cease, they would be compelled to sacrifice their homes. Log cabins were the order of the day, as lath and plaster was out of reach on account of high prices. The Union Pacific still continued to collect their ground rent, and the knowledge that the miners had of the company that was ruling the camp at that time deterred them from beautifying their homes as they desired.\n[[File:Scofield Jail.jpg|right|thumb|Scofield Utah's historic jail]]\nHowever, this state of affairs was not to continue for long, as the rights of the company to hold the land came to be questioned. Part of their land was [[land claim|jumped]], and their title was found to be imperfect. In fact, they had no title whatever to the land now incorporated in the townsite. The business district was more than a mile long and boasted dozens of substantial stone buildings, including an [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows Hall]].<ref name=disast/> As the mine and the community grew, new and more efficient methods were sought to move the coal from the mines, and so the Utah & Pleasant Valley Railroad was constructed, running from Springville to Winter Quarters and Scofield. It connected with the [[Denver & Rio Grande]] line in [[Colton, Utah|Colton]] {{convert|18|mi}} to the northeast.<ref name=edge/>\n\nIn 1882, the Utah Fuel Company took over the mine and town, and it soon became a subsidiary of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The region continued to thrive until 1900, when there were several hundred men in the mines and residents that numbered as high as 1,800. The mine was considered to be the safest in the region and according to reports, was free from the gases that plagued so many other coal operations.\n\n[[File:ScofieldMineCoffins.jpg|left|thumb|Coffins waiting for transport to disaster site]]\n\n===Disaster===\n{{Main|Scofield Mine disaster}}\nOn May 1, 1900, an errant spark touched off the fine haze of coal dust deep underground, and the Winter Quarters #4 mine exploded with fury. Exactly 100 of the men were killed in an instant, and another 99 died from the poisonous [[afterdamp]], making this one of the worst coal mine disasters in history. Death came so swiftly that some of the mineworkers were found still clutching their tools. That one moment of time left 105 widows and 270 fatherless children behind. Almost 150 of the slain miners were buried in the cemetery in nearby Scofield, and two special funeral trains carried the rest of the victims to burial grounds in Utah and in other states.\n\n===Decline===\nOn May 28, just four weeks after the disaster in Number Four, coal mining resumed at Winter Quarters. While some of those who had escaped the explosion left the area for other work, many others returned to the mines. The dead were soon replaced, though production evidently suffered somewhat from the loss of more experienced miners. Despite declining profitability, the Winter Quarters mines continued to operate until the 1930s. The [[coal tipple]] and other large structures were dismantled for their salvage value during World War II; the chapel and the boarding house were leveled.<ref name=edge/>\n\nScofield, sustained by several mines in Pleasant Valley, was still the largest town in Carbon County in 1915, when its citizens made an attempt to have the county seat moved to their community from [[Price, Utah|Price]]. By the 1920s, however, the coal industry in Pleasant Valley was clearly in decline and most mines ceased operation causing the town to lose nearly all its residents.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Scofield lies in the [[bituminous]] coal field of Carbon County, Utah, about {{convert|19|mi}} from the main line of the Rio Grande Western Railroad, and is nestled among the hills that surround the upper part of Pleasant Valley. The town is situated along Mud Creek, just south (upstream) of the Scofield Reservoir. The outlet of the reservoir is the [[Price River]], which flows southeast to the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] and is thus part of the [[Colorado River]] basin.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Scofield has a total area of {{convert|1.8|sqkm|order=flip}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n[[Utah State Route 96]] passes through Scofield, leading north then east {{convert|17|mi}} to [[U.S. Route 6]] near [[Colton, Utah|Colton]], and south {{convert|6|mi}} to its end at [[Clear Creek, Utah|Clear Creek]].\n\n===Climate===\nScofield has an [[Subarctic climate|alpine subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') with enormous yearly snowfall in its long, cold winters due to its location in the Wasatch Range.

There were no families and 9.1% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.\n\nAlthough the number of people living in Scofield is low, many own cabins, summer and winter homes, and fishing shacks around Scofield Reservoir. There is also a state park located by the lake.\n\n==Scofield State Park==\n[[File:Scofield.jpg|thumb|right]]\nScofield State Park surrounds [[Scofield Reservoir]] and has three different camping areas: Mountain View, Madsen Bay, and Lake Side. Mountain View is a 34-unit campground that includes restrooms, heated showers, fish cleaning and disposal stations, a group use pavilion, a boat launching ramp, and rental boats. Madsen Bay is a 40-unit campground with restrooms, fish cleaning and disposal areas, a boat ramp, and parking for day use. Lake Side has no camping areas and is strictly day use, offering restrooms, a group use pavilion and a fishing platform for the disabled.\n\n==Clear Creek Camp==\nClear Creek Camp is an outdoor education center located {{convert|2|mi|0}} south of the town of Scofield, for post-fifth grade students in the Alpine School District. Each summer, Clear Creek Camp hosts approximately 1,100 students. The summer camp experience is designed to educate students about the outdoors and help foster a deep appreciation for the abundant natural resources and beauty in their surroundings. The camp has its roots in an outdoor education program held at Central Elementary School in the 1940s. Between 1940 and the 1960s, the program eventually grew to be so successful that a summer camp was requested. It was held at various locations for many years, including the town of [[Clear Creek, Utah|Clear Creek]] for which it is named. After being there for a few years, property became available from Questar (then Mountain Fuel) with six cabins and a multi-purpose facility in 1973. The facilities were ready to use for groups of students in 1974, and Alpine School District has used the same grounds since then.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Utah}}\n* [[List of cities and towns in Utah]]\n* [[Scofield Mine disaster]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Scofield, Utah}}\n* [http://www.utah.com/stateparks/scofield.htm Scofield State Park official website]\n* [http://www.pleasantvalleydays.com Pleasant Valley Days], annual summer festival in Scofield\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Scofield\n|North     = [[Independence, Utah|Independence]]<br/>''[[Uinta National Forest]]''\n|Northeast = ''[[Scofield Reservoir]]''\n|East      = [[Helper, Utah|Helper]]<br/>[[Price, Utah|Price]]\n|Southeast = [[Elmo, Utah|Elmo]]<br/>[[Huntington, Utah|Huntington]], [[Cleveland, Utah|Cleveland]]\n|South     = [[Emery, Utah|Emery]], [[Ferron, Utah|Ferron]], [[Clawson, Utah|Clawson]], [[Orangeville, Utah|Orangeville]] [[Castle Dale, Utah|Castle Dale]]\n|Southwest = [[Fairview, Utah|Fairview]]<br/>[[Mount Pleasant, Utah|Mount Pleasant]]\n|West      = [[Mona, Utah|Mona]]<br/>[[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]]\n|Northwest = [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]], [[Mapleton, Utah|Mapleton]]<br/>[[Woodland Hills, Utah|Woodland Hill]]<br/>[[Santaquin, Utah|Santaquin]]<br/>[[Rocky Ridge, Utah|Rocky Ridge]]\n}}\n\n{{Carbon County, Utah}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Carbon County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Utah]]\n[[Category:Towns in Utah]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1877]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Scofield, Utah\n|settlement_type          = [[Town]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = Scofield School.jpg\n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = Historic Scofield Utah School building\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|image_map                = Carbon County Utah incorporated and unincorporated areas Scofield highlighted.svg\n|map_caption              = Location in [[Carbon County, UT|Carbon County]] and the state of [[Utah]]\n|image_map1               = Map of USA UT.svg\n|map_caption1             = Location of Utah in the United States\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = {{flag|United States}}\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = {{flag|Utah}}\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Utah|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Carbon County, Utah|Carbon]]\n\n<!-- Government -->\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = \n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = Founded\n|established_date         = 1879\n|named_for                = Mathew B.

The community was named for General Charles W. Scofield, a timber contractor and local mine official. It is the smallest incorporated area in Utah by population.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Scofield Cemetery.jpg|left|thumb|Scofield Cemetery and some of its wooden gravestones]]\nThe town of Scofield is situated on high ground two miles south of the reservoir of the same name, the oldest and largest of the major impoundments on the [[Wasatch Plateau]]. Once the most populous community in Carbon County, Scofield has shrunk to only a few permanent residents. What has slowed the continual decline has become outsiders constructing summer vacation homes. The old brick school stands empty at the upper end of town, and there are abandoned buildings scattered through what was once the business district. Only the cemetery on a hill to the east suggests that this was once a community of some size. Visitors to the cemetery quickly become aware of the diverse ethnicity that populated the town.<ref name=edge>{{cite book | last = Geary | first = Edward A. | title = The proper edge of the sky: the high plateau country of Utah | date = March 12, 2002 | publisher = [[University of Utah Press]] | isbn = 0-87480-409-4}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement===\nDue to the luxuriant growth of the native grasses indigenous to this region, this valley was first utilized as pastures for the immense herds of cattle that came from [[Utah Valley]]. Among the first settlers of this region were S. J. Harkness, T. H. Thomas, William Burrows, O. G. Kimball, D. D. Green, A. H. Earll, R. McKecheney, who were attracted by the immense ranges for their cattle.<ref name=disast>{{cite book | last = Dilley | first = James W. | title = History of the Scofield mine disaster| url = https://archive.org/details/historyscofield00dillgoog }}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of coal and coming of the railroad===\n[[Coal]] was discovered in the valley in 1875, and two years later a small mine was opened on the western slopes of the canyon, with the coal transported out along narrow roads. The winter of 1877 came early and was very severe, stranding the miners in the coal pit and keeping them snowbound until the following February. The ordeal led the miners to name their forced camp \"[[Winter Quarters, Utah|Winter Quarters]]\". It became one of the first commercial coal mines in the state. Most of the first miners at the Winter Quarters were [[Mormon]] converts from the coal districts of [[Wales]], [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. One of them, David Williams, leased the Winter Quarters Mine from the Pleasant Valley Coal Company from 1880 to 1885, operating in the dual capacity of mine manager and [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of the local [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]].  When the [[Rio Grande Western Railway]] acquired the coal company, they undertook the development of a new mine on Mud Creek, a mile from Winter Quarters, much to the chagrin of Williams, who protested that the new mine infringed on his lease. Because Bishop Williams controlled the Mormon miners, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company brought in [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese laborers]] to work the Mud Creek mine. Soon a large contingent of [[Finns]] were recruited, along with [[Italians|Italian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and other [[Scandinavia]]n workers.<ref name=edge/>\n\nAs coal veins commenced to be worked, it was not long before the discoverers found out that the supply seemed inexhaustible. The railway companies finding that the coal fields were of such magnitude and covered so much territory, began to survey for practicable routes to reach the coal. The route through [[Spanish Fork River|Spanish Fork Canyon]] was finally decided upon, and a [[narrow-gauge railroad]] was built into Scofield. Before the railroad was completed, winter set in, and the last few miles were laid upon the ice and snow as it was impossible to find the ground due to the snow drifts. The [[Union Pacific]] Coal Company claimed all of the land on the town site, and those building a home were compelled to lease the spot of ground desired from this company. Not knowing how long they would be permitted to remain as laborers in the mines, the men did not build elaborate homes, as they knew that should the work cease, they would be compelled to sacrifice their homes. Log cabins were the order of the day, as lath and plaster was out of reach on account of high prices. The Union Pacific still continued to collect their ground rent, and the knowledge that the miners had of the company that was ruling the camp at that time deterred them from beautifying their homes as they desired.\n[[File:Scofield Jail.jpg|right|thumb|Scofield Utah's historic jail]]\nHowever, this state of affairs was not to continue for long, as the rights of the company to hold the land came to be questioned. Part of their land was [[land claim|jumped]], and their title was found to be imperfect. In fact, they had no title whatever to the land now incorporated in the townsite. The business district was more than a mile long and boasted dozens of substantial stone buildings, including an [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows Hall]].<ref name=disast/> As the mine and the community grew, new and more efficient methods were sought to move the coal from the mines, and so the Utah & Pleasant Valley Railroad was constructed, running from Springville to Winter Quarters and Scofield. It connected with the [[Denver & Rio Grande]] line in [[Colton, Utah|Colton]] {{convert|18|mi}} to the northeast.<ref name=edge/>\n\nIn 1882, the Utah Fuel Company took over the mine and town, and it soon became a subsidiary of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The region continued to thrive until 1900, when there were several hundred men in the mines and residents that numbered as high as 1,800. The mine was considered to be the safest in the region and according to reports, was free from the gases that plagued so many other coal operations.\n\n[[File:ScofieldMineCoffins.jpg|left|thumb|Coffins waiting for transport to disaster site]]\n\n===Disaster===\n{{Main|Scofield Mine disaster}}\nOn May 1, 1900, an errant spark touched off the fine haze of coal dust deep underground, and the Winter Quarters #4 mine exploded with fury. Exactly 100 of the men were killed in an instant, and another 99 died from the poisonous [[afterdamp]], making this one of the worst coal mine disasters in history. Death came so swiftly that some of the mineworkers were found still clutching their tools. That one moment of time left 105 widows and 270 fatherless children behind. Almost 150 of the slain miners were buried in the cemetery in nearby Scofield, and two special funeral trains carried the rest of the victims to burial grounds in Utah and in other states.\n\n===Decline===\nOn May 28, just four weeks after the disaster in Number Four, coal mining resumed at Winter Quarters. While some of those who had escaped the explosion left the area for other work, many others returned to the mines. The dead were soon replaced, though production evidently suffered somewhat from the loss of more experienced miners. Despite declining profitability, the Winter Quarters mines continued to operate until the 1930s. The [[coal tipple]] and other large structures were dismantled for their salvage value during World War II; the chapel and the boarding house were leveled.<ref name=edge/>\n\nScofield, sustained by several mines in Pleasant Valley, was still the largest town in Carbon County in 1915, when its citizens made an attempt to have the county seat moved to their community from [[Price, Utah|Price]]. By the 1920s, however, the coal industry in Pleasant Valley was clearly in decline and most mines ceased operation causing the town to lose nearly all its residents.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Scofield lies in the [[bituminous]] coal field of Carbon County, Utah, about {{convert|19|mi}} from the main line of the Rio Grande Western Railroad, and is nestled among the hills that surround the upper part of Pleasant Valley. The town is situated along Mud Creek, just south (upstream) of the Scofield Reservoir.

The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]].\n\nThere were 12 households out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.7% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.50.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 14.3% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 28.6% from 45 to 64, and 21.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 75.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $26,250, and the median income for a family was $28,750. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $14,375 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $10,764. There were no families and 9.1% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.\n\nAlthough the number of people living in Scofield is low, many own cabins, summer and winter homes, and fishing shacks around Scofield Reservoir. There is also a state park located by the lake.\n\n==Scofield State Park==\n[[File:Scofield.jpg|thumb|right]]\nScofield State Park surrounds [[Scofield Reservoir]] and has three different camping areas: Mountain View, Madsen Bay, and Lake Side. Mountain View is a 34-unit campground that includes restrooms, heated showers, fish cleaning and disposal stations, a group use pavilion, a boat launching ramp, and rental boats. Madsen Bay is a 40-unit campground with restrooms, fish cleaning and disposal areas, a boat ramp, and parking for day use. Lake Side has no camping areas and is strictly day use, offering restrooms, a group use pavilion and a fishing platform for the disabled.\n\n==Clear Creek Camp==\nClear Creek Camp is an outdoor education center located {{convert|2|mi|0}} south of the town of Scofield, for post-fifth grade students in the Alpine School District. Each summer, Clear Creek Camp hosts approximately 1,100 students. The summer camp experience is designed to educate students about the outdoors and help foster a deep appreciation for the abundant natural resources and beauty in their surroundings. The camp has its roots in an outdoor education program held at Central Elementary School in the 1940s. Between 1940 and the 1960s, the program eventually grew to be so successful that a summer camp was requested. It was held at various locations for many years, including the town of [[Clear Creek, Utah|Clear Creek]] for which it is named. After being there for a few years, property became available from Questar (then Mountain Fuel) with six cabins and a multi-purpose facility in 1973. The facilities were ready to use for groups of students in 1974, and Alpine School District has used the same grounds since then.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Utah}}\n* [[List of cities and towns in Utah]]\n* [[Scofield Mine disaster]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Scofield, Utah}}\n* [http://www.utah.com/stateparks/scofield.htm Scofield State Park official website]\n* [http://www.pleasantvalleydays.com Pleasant Valley Days], annual summer festival in Scofield\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Scofield\n|North     = [[Independence, Utah|Independence]]<br/>''[[Uinta National Forest]]''\n|Northeast = ''[[Scofield Reservoir]]''\n|East      = [[Helper, Utah|Helper]]<br/>[[Price, Utah|Price]]\n|Southeast = [[Elmo, Utah|Elmo]]<br/>[[Huntington, Utah|Huntington]], [[Cleveland, Utah|Cleveland]]\n|South     = [[Emery, Utah|Emery]], [[Ferron, Utah|Ferron]], [[Clawson, Utah|Clawson]], [[Orangeville, Utah|Orangeville]] [[Castle Dale, Utah|Castle Dale]]\n|Southwest = [[Fairview, Utah|Fairview]]<br/>[[Mount Pleasant, Utah|Mount Pleasant]]\n|West      = [[Mona, Utah|Mona]]<br/>[[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]]\n|Northwest = [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]], [[Mapleton, Utah|Mapleton]]<br/>[[Woodland Hills, Utah|Woodland Hill]]<br/>[[Santaquin, Utah|Santaquin]]<br/>[[Rocky Ridge, Utah|Rocky Ridge]]\n}}\n\n{{Carbon County, Utah}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Carbon County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Utah]]\n[[Category:Towns in Utah]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1877]]\n", "name_user": "Old Hoar's Frost", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClimate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scofield,_Utah"}

It has two passenger terminals with an additional midfield terminal, two runways as well as extensive cargo and maintenance facilities and is fully equipped to handle wide-body aircraft including the [[Airbus A380]].\n\n==History==\n===Development===\n[[File:Sud_SE-210_Caravelle_10B3_Super_B,_Air_Toulouse_AN0204076.jpg|thumb|An [[Air Toulouse]] [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] at Munich Airport in 1993 with the construction site of today's [[Hilton Munich Airport]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Munich (- Franz Josef Strauss) (MUC - EDDM) AN0174880.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Terminal 1 in 2001, when Terminal 2 was not yet operational.]]\nMunich's previous airport, [[Munich-Riem Airport]], was operational from 1939 to 1992. Initial plans for an expansion of the airport date back to the year 1954. With rising passenger numbers and a growing number of inhabitants in its proximity, plans were made to completely move the airport to another site. The Bavarian government took the decision to build a new airport in the area called \"Erdinger Moos\" on 5 August 1969. When construction started on 3 November 1980, the small village of Franzheim disappeared and its approximately 400 inhabitants were resettled. The airport is located on the territory of four different municipalities: [[Oberding]] (location of the terminals; [[Erding (district)|district of Erding]]), [[Hallbergmoos]], [[Freising]], and [[Marzling]] in the [[Freising (district)|district of Freising]].\n\nThe new Munich airport commenced operations on 17 May 1992, and all flights to and from Munich were moved to the new site overnight. Munich-Riem closed on 16 May 1992 shortly before midnight.\n\nThe airport is named after [[Franz Josef Strauss]], who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial, role in West German politics from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Amongst other positions, Strauss was a long-time [[Minister-President]] (Governor) of the state of [[Bavaria]]. Strauss, a private pilot himself, initiated the new airport project and was particularly interested in attracting the aviation industry to Bavaria. He is regarded as one of the fathers of the [[Airbus]] project and served as initial chairman of the Airbus supervisory board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/|title=Early days (1967\u20131969)|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195621/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/|archive-date=5 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFlughafen M\u00fcnchen [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]], which owns and operates Munich Airport, is a limited liability company consisting of three shareholders: the State of Bavaria (51%), the Federal Republic of Germany (26%) and the City of Munich (23%). The logo of Munich Airport consists of the letter \"M\" with the slogan \"Living ideas \u2013 Connecting lives\". Munich Airport is usually referred to as \"Flughafen M\u00fcnchen\" or simply \"MUC\", its IATA code. During construction the airport was referred to as \"Flughafen M\u00fcnchen II\".\n\n===Operations===\nAs their home base at [[Frankfurt Airport]] suffered from capacity limits back then, [[Lufthansa]] established a second hub offering several short- and long-haul connections through Munich in addition to Frankfurt. While Lufthansa serves more European destinations from Munich Airport than from Frankfurt Airport, Frankfurt has many more intercontinental routes.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million,<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Munich's traffic doubles in 10 years; Lufthansa adds more routes than it drops as a host of new airlines announce new services|date=20 April 2010|url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/04/20/munichs-traffic-doubles-in-10-years/ |work=anna.aero}}</ref> despite the impact of the [[11 September attacks]] in 2001 and 2002. In 1996 the airport overtook [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport|D\u00fcsseldorf]] as Germany's second-busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the country's third-busiest airport.\n\nIn June 2003, construction of Terminal 2 was completed and it was inaugurated as an exclusive facility for Lufthansa and its [[Star Alliance]] partners.\n\nIn November 2013, the airport introduced its first new [[corporate design]] since its inauguration. The large letter 'M' remains in a new font type, and a dash has been added which changes between several colors. There are also animated color-changing versions of the 'M'-sign placed throughout the airport area, for example on the main entrance road and on the new Terminal 2 satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designtagebuch.de/flughafen-muenchen-erhaelt-neues-corporate-design/|title=Flughafen M\u00fcnchen erh\u00e4lt neues Corporate Design|author=Achim Schaffrinna|work=Design Tagebuch|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] announced it intends to establish a long-haul base at Munich Airport from the 2016 summer season.

The approach road and railway divide the west part into a southern half, which contains cargo and maintenance facilities, and a northern half, which contains mostly administrative buildings and service facilities, a holiday long-term parking lot and the visitors' centre. It is followed by the west apron and Terminal 1, then the Munich Airport Center (MAC), Terminal 2 and the east apron. Munich Airport has two passenger terminals, and shuffled 20\u201325 million people through each terminal in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flight-hub-reviews.com/munich-international-flight-hub/|title=Munich International Flight Hub|date=2 May 2015|work=Flight Hub Reviews|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419002824/http://flight-hub-reviews.com/munich-international-flight-hub/|archive-date=19 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Karte vom Flughafen M\u00fcnchen (inkl. geplanter Erweiterung).png|600px|Map of Munich Airport (including planned expansion)}}\n\n===Terminal 1===\n{{Wide image|Munich Airport from visitors park.jpg|1000px|View of the main apron in front of Terminal 1|100%}}\n[[File:Munich Airport T1 L4 B check in.jpg|thumb|Check-in area at Terminal 1B]]\n[[File:Munich airport 2.jpg|thumb|Boarding gate area at Terminal 1D]]\nTerminal 1 is the older terminal and commenced operation when the airport was opened on 17 May 1992. It has a total capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is subdivided into five ''modules'' designated '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''' and '''E'''. Modules A through D provide all facilities necessary to handle departures and arrivals, including individual landside driveways and parking, whereas module E is equipped to handle arrivals only. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own. Modules A and D are used for flights within the Schengen-area, while modules B and C handle those to destinations outside it. '''Hall F''' is separate, located near Terminal 2, and handles flights with increased security requirements, i.e. those to [[Israel]]. Furthermore, the check-in counters for some flights departing from Terminal 1 are located in the central area '''Z''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Zentralbereich}}) where most of the shopping and restaurant facilities of this Terminal as well as the airport's suburban railway station are also located.\n\nThe {{convert|1081|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid}} pier features 21 [[jet bridge]]s, two of which have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. One gate position has been equipped with three jet bridges to handle the [[Airbus A380]] which is regularly used by [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]]. There are further 60 aircraft stands on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially designed apron jet bridges ({{lang-de|link=no|Vorfeldfluggastbr\u00fccken}}), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investment required for full [[satellite terminal]]s connected through a [[people mover|passenger transport system]].\n\nTerminal 1 currently handles all airlines that are not members or partners of the [[Star Alliance]] with the exception of [[Turkish Airlines]]. However, owing to lack of capacity at Terminal 2, Lufthansa's subsidiary [[Germanwings]] and former affiliate [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] both moved back to Terminal 1 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmm.travel/news/artikel/lesen/2007/07/germanwings-wechselt-terminals-in-muenchen-10511/|title=Germanwings wechselt Terminals in M\u00fcnchen|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415030917/http://dmm.travel/news/artikel/lesen/2007/07/germanwings-wechselt-terminals-in-muenchen-10511/|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-one.net/news/produkt/article/muenchen-condor-kuenftig-im-terminal-1/|title=Travel ONE: Produkt|work=travel-one.net|accessdate=2 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040447/http://www.travel-one.net/news/produkt/article/muenchen-condor-kuenftig-im-terminal-1/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Germanwings however moved back to Terminal 2 in late 2015.

Terminal areas A and B will be entirely redesigned with the addition of a {{Convert|320|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} pier stretching out on the apron. The new facilities will provide capacity for 6 million additional passengers, will be able to handle 12 aircraft including two Airbus A380s at once, and are due to open by 2022.<ref>[http://www.aero.de/news-25446/Terminal-1-wird-fuer-400-Millionen-Euro-erweitert.html aero.de \u2013 \"Terminal 1 to be extended for \u20ac400m\"] (German) 19 November 2016</ref>\n\n===Terminal 2===\n[[File:Munich (- Franz Josef Strauss) (MUC - EDDM) AN0517640.jpg|thumb|Check-in area at Terminal 2, the notable hanging sculpture advertising [[BMW]] has since been removed]]\n[[File:Airport Munich innen 2009 PD 20090404 036.JPG|thumb|Boarding gate area at Terminal 2]]\nTerminal 2 commenced operation on 29 June 2003. It has a design capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is exclusively used by [[Lufthansa]] and all other [[Star Alliance]] members serving Munich except [[Turkish Airlines]]. Star Alliance partners [[Air Malta]], [[Luxair]] and [[BMI Regional]] also use Terminal 2. [[Etihad Airways]] relocated to this terminal as well after commencing a partnership with Lufthansa.\n\nHaving been designed as a hub terminal it is not divided into modules like Terminal 1. Instead, all facilities are arranged around a central ''Plaza''. Owing to security regulations imposed by the European Union, the terminal has been equipped with facilities to handle passengers from countries considered insecure, i.e. not implementing the same regulations. This required the construction of a new level as, unlike other airports, the terminal does not have separate areas for arriving and departing passengers. The new level 06 opened on 15 January 2009.\n\nThe pier, which is {{convert|980|m|abbr=on}} long, is equipped with 24 jet bridges. As the total number of 75 aircraft stands on the east apron is not always sufficient, Terminal 2 sometimes also uses parking positions on the west apron, to which passengers are carried by airside buses. Terminal 2 is able to handle the [[Airbus A380]] as well, however, prior to the opening of the Terminal 2 satellite building, there were no designated stands or additional jet bridges for it. Lufthansa flies the A380 into the satellite building.<ref>[https://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2017/06/13/lufthansa-a380-munich/ onemileatatime.boardingarea.com] retrieved 14 June 2018</ref>\n\nTerminal 2 has two main departure levels, 04 and 05 and additional bus gates on the lower level 03. Gates on level 05 ('''H''') are designated non-Schengen gates. Until the new transfer level 06 opened, the northernmost gates were behind an additional security checkpoint for departures to the USA most of the day. The lower level 04 ('''G''') contains Schengen gates. The bus gates on level 03 are also designated '''G''' and are also used for Schengen flights. Level 03 is smaller than the main levels and consists of two separate parts which can be reached from two points on level 04. One area of these gates is designated to [[Air Dolomiti]].\n\nThe terminal is operated by ''Terminal-2-Betriebsgesellschaft'' (German for ''Terminal 2 Operating Company''), which is owned by Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH (60%) and Lufthansa (40%). This makes Terminal 2 the first terminal in Germany which is co-operated by an airline.\n\n===Terminal 2 Satellite===\n[[File:Satellite_2_muc.png|thumb|Terminal 2 Satellite building still under construction]]\nTerminal 2 was projected to reach its full capacity of handling 27.5 million passengers a year by 2013. Lufthansa and [[Star Alliance]] partners stipulated the expansion of Terminal 2 without constructing the separate facilities for luggage claim, arrival and departure levels, etc. This was to ensure the easy access for the passengers who appreciate the convenience of central plaza for checking in their luggage, going through the security screening, and such as well as transferring from one plane to other within Lufthansa and Star Alliance partner networks inside Terminal 2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/index.jsp |title=Startklar f\u00fcr die Zukunft, Ein Satellit f\u00fcr das Terminal 2 |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219225530/http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/index.jsp |archive-date=19 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/freising/erdinger-moos-flughafen-modernisiert-terminal-1.1109496 |title=Erdinger Moos \u2013 Flughafen modernisiert Terminal 1 |work=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung |date=17 June 2011 |last=V\u00f6lklein |first=Marcos}}</ref> After the completion of Terminal 2 in 2003, the preparations for a new satellite terminal already had been made.\n\nThe project cost is 650 million Euro with Munich Airport contributing 60% and Lufthansa 40% toward the project.<ref name=\"satellitefacts\">[http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/facts/index.jsp munich-airport.de \u2013 Daten und Fakten zum Satelliten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023233929/http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/facts/index.jsp |date=23 October 2015 }} retrieved 6 December 2015</ref> The expansion would handle additional 11 million passengers per year.

No further detail about number of gates along with construction and completion dates is given yet.\n\n===Munich Airport Center===\n[[File:munich airport central.jpg|thumb|Munich Airport Center]]\nThe Munich Airport Center (sometimes shortened to ''MAC'') is a shopping, business, and recreation area that connects the terminals. The older ''Central Area'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Zentralbereich}}), which was originally built as part of Terminal 1, hosts a shopping mall and the [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] station. The newer ''MAC Forum'' built with Terminal 2 is a large outdoor area with a partly transparent tent-like roof. Next to it is the airport hotel managed by [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] which was designed by the world-famous architect [[Helmut Jahn]] and landscape architecture firm [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|PWP Landscape Architecture]] in 1994.\n\nThe Munich Airport Center has a supermarket where one can shop from 5:30&nbsp;a.m. to midnight every day, including sundays,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/shops/a-z/E/edeka_Z/index.jsp |title=Munich Airport \u2013 Edeka |publisher=Munich-airport.de |accessdate=4 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227190905/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/shops/a-z/E/edeka_Z/index.jsp |archivedate=27 December 2013  }}</ref> as it is exempt from the Bavarian law governing retail hours of operation ({{lang-de| [[Ladenschlussgesetz]]}}).<ref>[[Ladenschlussgesetz]]</ref>\n\n===Runways===\nThe airport has two parallel runways and one concrete [[helipad]].

According to ''Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH'' (''FMG''), the airport's operator, the current two-runway system is already operating at full capacity during peak hours, and requests for additional slots from airlines have been denied. Further increase in air traffic is expected as Munich is to become a second major hub in Germany after [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]].\n\nIn August 2007, the airport operator applied for planning permission from the government of [[Upper Bavaria]]. More than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans. The objections and lawsuits against the third runway were later overturned by the Bavarian Administrative Court, allowing for construction plans to proceed.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, the government of Upper Bavaria issued the zoning approval for the construction of a third runway. With this decision, the zoning authority, after the intensive examination and consideration of all ramifications, expressly approved the need presented by Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH and the plans submitted for the third runway. Also tied to the approval by the government of Upper Bavaria is the prompt completion of the construction project. However, the airport operator has chosen to follow the advice of Bavaria's Higher Administrative Court and not to proceed until the principal proceedings concerning the project have reached a conclusion. The decision is currently being reviewed by the court. The building permit associated with the zoning will continue to be valid for up to 15 years.\n\nWhile according to [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] Regulations (Annex XIV) the new runway would have to be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muc-ausbau.de/downloads/gutachten_PFV/B001_LU_01Techn_Beschreibg.pdf|author=DC Airports|title=Erl\u00e4uterungsbericht Technische Planung Luftseite|work=Planfeststellungsverfahren 3.

The plans include a new {{Convert|4000|m|ft|adj=mid}} runway northeast of the existing airport and a new satellite building at Terminal 2, the latter of which did open in April 2016. However, construction of the new runway may yet be delayed as the project has to have unanimous approval by the airport's three shareholders: Bavaria, Federal Republic of Germany and the City of Munich. The latter has opposed the plan since a 2012 referendum.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Green Light for Munich Expansion|journal=Airliner World|date=October 2015|page=8}}</ref>\n\n===Parking areas===\n[[File:Parkhaus.JPG|thumb|Parking garage in front of [[Munich Airport#Terminal 1|Terminal&nbsp;1]]]]\nCurrently, there are five parking garages and six underground parking areas, amounting together to a total of 30,000 parking spaces<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/parkbereiche/index.jsp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420095853/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/parkbereiche/index.jsp| url-status=dead| archive-date=20 April 2013| title=Parking areas| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> of which approximately 16,500 are under a roof. The parking garage P20 at Terminal 2, with 6,400 parking spaces on eleven levels (including four that are underground) since its commissioning in 2003 was the largest parking garage in Germany until the car park at the new [[Allianz Arena]] was opened in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bfk-architekten.de/projekte/parkhaeuser/parkhaus-airport-muenchen/ | title=Parkhaus Airport | publisher=BFK Architekten | language=German | accessdate=27 May 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527163051/http://bfk-architekten.de/projekte/parkhaeuser/parkhaus-airport-muenchen/ | archivedate=27 May 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A parking guidance system was installed in the parking garages, which detects whether a parking space is occupied and newly arriving vehicles are shown where the empty parking spaces are located.\n\nApart from the usual parking facilities, the Munich Airport offers, at additional cost, special parking spaces with additional benefits. This includes [[valet parking]], in which the vehicle is picked up by an airport employee upon flight departure and parked, and the Park, Sleep & Fly option, in which a night at the Hilton hotel is included. Also there is an option for oversized parking spaces, the so-called XXL parking, and secure parking. Lastly, there is a special separate parking level in the P20 parking garage, where the parked cars are guarded. In addition, special services can be booked, such as interior/exterior cleaning and fuelling.\n\nTo make shopping in the public areas more attractive for local residents of the airport area, there are special offers where visitors can park up to three hours for free in the P20 parking garage.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/aktionsspecial/parken_shopping/index.jsp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115170303/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/aktionsspecial/parken_shopping/index.jsp| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2014| title=Parking and shopping| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> Short-term parking can be found east of the central area, where visitors can park for free for a maximum of thirty minutes. During the holiday periods other cheaper options are provided in the P8 parking garage.\n\n===Visitor viewing facilities===\n[[File:Besucherzentrum.jpg|thumb|''Visitors Park'' at Munich Airport]]\nThe airport authorities have set out to cater for visitors and sightseers by creating a 'Visitors Park' which includes a 'Visitors Hill', from which a good view of the westerly aircraft apron and Terminal 1 can be obtained, as well as a restaurant and a shop for aircraft models and other collectors' items. This location is served by a railway station named '[[Munich Airport Besucherpark station|Besucherpark]]'. The view from the hill is shown in the above widescreen image of the Terminal 1 apron. Three historic aircraft are on display in the park, a [[Super Constellation]], a [[Douglas DC-3]], and a [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m]].\n\nThere is also a visitors' viewing terrace on the roof of Terminal 2 that features a wide, glassed balcony with seating areas and gives a view of the easterly aircraft apron. All visitors can access the terrace from the landside. The entrance fee was abolished in September 2013. There are two additional smaller ''Visitor Hills'' on the north end of the north runway and at the center of the south runway.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Munich Airport:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/fluginfo/flugsuche1/index.jsp|title=Munich Airport \u2013 Flightsearch/Timetable|publisher=Munich Airport|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE ROUTES WITHOUT GIVING A VALID SOURCE.

It developed a so-called \"four-pillar strategy\" with an overall concept designed to improve environmental protection; these four pillars include:\n\n:\"Reduction of CO2 emissions through technological progress and innovation, particularly in the field of engine development; a more efficient infrastructure with a needs-based adaptation of airport capacity with concentration on the avoidance of, for example, polluting queues; operational measures such as the optimization of soil processes; economic incentives\"\n:\u2014Perspectives.

At the opening of the airport, 70% of the grounds were planted; today there are 925 of the 1,575 hectares which remained planted, only 60%.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/facts/allg/index.jsp| title=General information| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123111/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/facts/allg/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The prevalent Erdinger Moos area with its many intersecting small streams, and woodland series was taking into consideration in the planning by the landscape architect. At the same time, consideration was taking in making the airport unattractive to birds, in order to prevent [[bird strike]]s. An additional 230-acre green belt was placed around the airport as a compensation area, in which the overall compensation areas extend over 600 acres.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/konzept/index.jsp| title=Landscape concept and planning| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123015/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/konzept/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Even with the focus on the environment, environmental groups criticize the enormous [[land consumption]] of the airport and each additional expansion project. Also, they believe that the compensation areas are not sufficient enough in order to compensate for the damage caused by the airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bund-naturschutz-erding.de/pages/taufkirchen_landverbrauch.htm | title=Bauernverband und BN kritisieren Landverbrauch | website= | publisher=Bund Naturschutz Kreisgruppe Erding | language=German | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\nThe construction in the Erdinger Moos area had a large impact on the water budget of the region, since the [[groundwater]] levels in the [[marsh]]y landscape had to be greatly reduced by creating drainage ditches. Existing watercourses, such as small streams, were not interrupted, but redirected so that they now run either around or underneath the property, limiting the effects of groundwater reduction to only the areas in which the airport is located.\n\nThe wastewater from the airport and the collected rain water are both returned to the natural water cycle. In order to accomplish this, 100&nbsp;km of sewer lines were laid, and seven pumping stations, a water treatment plant and four rainwater sedimentation tanks were built and put into operation. The already rough cleansed water is then sent to a purification plant. For the necessary winter de-icing of the airport, used deicing chemicals such as glycol are collected together with the contaminated melted water, and then either purified or reused. The cleaning is done in the degradation system area, where soil bacteria decompose the glycol into harmless components of water and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/ressourcen/index.jsp| title=Water management| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217130143/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/ressourcen/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Noise===\n;General\nTo reduce noise from [[thrust reversal]] during aircraft landings, the runways were built to a length of 4,000 meters, however the noise reduction is offset by increased taxiing times. To reduce noise pollution, a hall for engine testing was built. After 11 p.m. engine tests may be carried out only with the approval of air traffic control. To motivate airlines to use low-noise aircraft, the airport charges are calculated according to the level of noise pollution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://derstandard.at/2993931 | title=\"L\u00e4rmsteuer\" f\u00fcr laute Flugzeuge | date=11 September 2007 | website= | work=Der Standard| language=German | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> There are 16 stationary noise measuring points at the airport.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/index.jsp| title=Noise control| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123254/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n;Night flight regulations\nAt Munich airport there is no strict ban on night flights, but a ban on flights arriving and departing between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.. The only exemptions are flights from mail services and DFS survey flights. From midnight until 5am only those flights that operate in the interest of the public are generally possible, this includes so-called emergency flights: police and rescue helicopter missions or medical emergencies. Also, aircraft movements for security reasons such as for precautionary landings are allowed at all times. Flights with special permission from the Bavarian Ministry for Economic Affairs, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology are also feasible at this time.\n\nFrom 10 p.m. to midnight and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. flights are possible through the so-called bonus list. Exceptions are delayed flights or premature landings if these aircraft are at least noise-admitted according to ICAO Chapter 3. In addition to both the bonus list and noise requirements they must fulfill further conditions, this includes that the airline must have a maintenance base at the airport, the maximum number of 28 scheduled flights per night (charter and scheduled services) must not be exceeded, the aircraft is not louder than 75 db (A) or it is an education or training flight.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/nachtflug/index.jsp| title=Night flight operations| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217122609/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/nachtflug/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis rule applies until the total annual volume is exhausted in air traffic movements by these regulations. More flights of this type are then no longer allowed. The number of night flights increased from 1999 to 2007 from 42 to 60 flights average per night.<ref name=\"perspectives\" />\n\nResidents have been protesting for years against aircraft noise, in particular against the noise pollution at night. The Government of Upper Bavaria approved the night flight regulations currently in force in 2001.\n\n===Energy===\n;Cogeneration plant\nMost of Munich airport's electricity and heat is generated by its own [[cogeneration]] plant (CHP), which is located south of the northern runway to the west of the airport. CHP has nine so-called cogeneration modules, seven run on diesel fuel, the other two on gasoline. The electrical generating capacity is 18.5 megawatts. The cogeneration modules run smoothly all year long; this creates surplus heat at certain times which is stored in heat storage to be used later. In summer, the heat generated is used for the operation of the absorption refrigerating machine. The total gross utilization rate is 78 percent (diesel) and 83 percent (gasoline).

It is a joint project of [[BP Solar]], [[BP|German BP]], ''Bundesdeutscher Arbeitskreis f\u00fcr Umweltbewusstes Management'', [[Lufthansa]], Munich Airport and others. In operation since 10 July 2003, it generates an average of 445,000 [[kilowatt hour]]s per year, equivalent to the consumption of 155 households.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.airport-world.com/news/general-news/2813-lufthansa-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-solar-panels-at-munich-airport.html | title=Lufthansa celebrates 10th Anniversary of Solar Panels at Munich Airport | date=2 July 2013 | website= | publisher=Airport World | accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> The power comes from 2,856 modules of silicon cells, covering a total area of 3,594 square metres.

This led automatically to the area being reported under the European Birds Directive as a bird sanctuary.\n\nThe fencing of the airport and the large meadows inside the fence attract open meadow birds. This leads to constant conflicts and the deaths, even of rare birds as a result of airplane accidents (vortices) and safety measures to avoid [[bird strike]]s. The planned third runway 3,440,000 square metres in the bird sanctuary will be laid with concrete, eliminating 8,000,000 square metres of living space. This would represent substantial interference with the bird sanctuary.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/index.jsp| title=Biodiversity| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=12 January 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217150416/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n===Police===\n[[File:Polizeihubschrauber Bayern.JPG|thumb|[[Eurocopter EC135]], the police helicopter squad of Bavaria at Munich Airport]]\nFor the safety of passengers and flight operations, four<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bundespolizei.de/Web/DE/05Die-Bundespolizei/03Organisation/02Direktionen/Muenchen/muenchen_node.html | title=Bundespolizeidirektion M\u00fcnchen | website= | publisher=Bundespolizei | language=German | accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> inspections by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]], departments of the [[Bavarian State Police]] (Police Inspection Munich Airport, PP Oberbayern Nord) and the security department of Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH are responsible.

A second station called ''[[Munich Airport Besucherpark station|Besucherpark]]'' (German for ''Visitors' Park'') is located in the area that contains the cargo and maintenance areas, long-term parking, administrative buildings and the Visitors' Park from which the station gets its name.\n\nThe airport is connected to the city by [[Munich S-Bahn|Munich suburban railway]] (''S-Bahn'') lines {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} and {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S8}}. The ride takes approximately 45 minutes to the Marienplatz station in the city centre. {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} runs from the airport through the northwestern suburbs and reaches the city centre from the west ([[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]] \u2013 [[M\u00fcnchen Marienplatz station|Marienplatz]] \u2013 [[M\u00fcnchen Ost station|M\u00fcnchen Ost]]), while {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S8}} comes in from the eastern suburbs passing the stations from the opposite direction.

This new connection enabled hourly regional express train services from [[Regensburg]] via [[Landshut]] directly to the airport without the need to use a connecting bus coming from the north or to go to Munich city center at first and then backtracking to the airport. The entire project was completed in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wochenblatt.de/politik/regensburg/artikel/265617/in-75-minuten-von-regensburg-zum-muenchner-flughafen |title=Neue Zugverbindung: In 75 Minuten von Regensburg zum M\u00fcnchner Flughafen |date=16 November 2018 |publisher=Wochen Blatt |author=Bayern Bahnland |language=German}}</ref> On 9 December 2018, the new hourly service, ''Flughafenexpress'' (''airport express'') between Regensburg and Munich Airport commenced.\n\n===Bus===\n[[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund|MVV]] regional bus lines connect the airport to the nearby city of [[Freising]] as well as [[Erding]] and [[Markt Schwaben]].

At an estimated cost of between 500 million and 2 billion [[Deutsche Mark]], each option would have allowed the airport to be integrated into the [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] network.<ref>{{cite book | date=1992 | title=Ein Jahr Hochgeschwindigkeitsverkehr | language=German | publisher=Deutsche Bahn | pages=4\u20136 }}</ref> However, the idea was rejected and instead concentration was placed on a better connection of the airport to regional transportation as well as to the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]].\n\n====Airport Express (S-Bahn)====\nAfter the cancellation of Transrapid proposal, several alternative proposals had been put forward that would utilise the current railway system with minor technical upgrades.\n\nOne proposal called \"Humpel-Express\" would utilise the most of current [[Munich-Regensburg railway]] and S1 lines with very limited stops along the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/freising/warten-auf-den-humpel-express-schneller-zum-airport-1.3073545 |title=Wo bleibt der \"Humpel-Express\"? |author=Alexandra Vettori |date=11 July 2016 |publisher=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung |language=German}}</ref> The \"Humpel-Express\" would travel at 200&nbsp;km/h and depart the Central Station and Munich Airport at 15-minute interval. The biggest issue was frequent level crossing closures at Fasanerie and Feldmoching (total of 39 minutes for every hour), causing the severe traffic congestions. Additionally, the construction of new line between Moosach and Munich Airport would cut through several towns and neighbourhoods, which the residents vehemently opposed. The new line also required the construction of new viaduct over the federal highway B471, increasing the cost further. The opposition from the resident and unwillingness to allot additional funding killed the proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merkur.de/lokales/muenchen/stadt-muenchen/airport-prueft-einen-eigenen-schnellzug-trasse-s1-mm-5862599.html |language=German |date=13 November 2015 |publisher=M\u00fcnchner Merkur |author=Johannes Welte and Felix M\u00fcller |title=Geheimplan: Flughafen pr\u00fcft eigene Expressbahn}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Munich S-Bahn#The Second S-Bahn Tunnel (Zweite Stammstrecke)|the Second S-Bahn Tunnel]] under construction, the proposed Airport Express service will peruse second S-Bahn tunnel upon completion with one stop, instead of four, at Marienhof between Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. This would reduce the travel time between Hauptbahnhof and Munich Airport to 30 minutes. Additionally, Deutsche Bahn has proposed the underground four-track S-Bahn tunnel from Leuchtenbergring to Halbergmoos S-Bahn stations. This would eliminate the need to slow down before passing through the intervening stations and the need to close the level crossings frequently. If the four-track extension is approved and constructed, the travel time would be reduced further to 15\u201318 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.ganze-region-will-in-den-mvv-neue-plaene-fuers-netz-das-wird-eine-mega-s-bahn.f0453323-81da-4252-afbb-34e2309692fc.html |title=Ganze Region will in den MVV Neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcrs Netz: das wird eine Mega-S-Bahn |language=German |date=31 March 2017 |publisher=Abendzeitung M\u00fcnchen |author=Florian Zick}}</ref>\n\n====Subway====\nThrough the extension of different [[Munich U-Bahn|subway lines]] to the intersection with one of the two airport suburban railways, the travel time to the airport from different parts of the north of Munich can be considerably reduced. This was realized for the suburbs of [[Milbertshofen-Am Hart]] and [[Feldmoching-Hasenbergl]] with the subway line {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|U2}} to the {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} station Feldmoching in 1996 and the construction of the airport connector near Neufahrn in 1998. In 2010, the travel time to the airport from [[Moosach (Munich)|Moosach]], Schwabing West and [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg]] districts was shortened by connecting the subway line {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|U3}} to the {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} station Moosach.

It will fulfill the demand of a rail connection between Eastern Bavaria, including the neighboring airport commuter cities [[Moosburg]] and [[Landshut]], to the airport, realized with its own regional railway line. A faster connection from the airport to the inner city is not achieved by the Erdinger ring connection, however a direct connection between the airport and the Munich Messe would be. For this, the S2 would also make a short route north of [[Messe M\u00fcnchen]] and have a stop north of the exhibition center.\nAlready before the opening of the airport there were plans for a regional station at the airport. To this, a railway connection from [[M\u00fchldorf]] am [[Inn (river)|Inn]] is to be made between Erding and [[Dorfen]] with the help of the Erdinger ring connection as well as a short new construction single-track called [[Erding Ring Closure|Walpertskirchner Spange]]. The actual planning phase for this also began, as in the case of the Erdinger ring connection, in August 2006.\nOn 29 August 2013, the Bavarian Administrative Court rejected the complaints against the plan approval decision of the [[Neufahrn Link]] of October 2012 and therefore freed the way for a direct rail connection of the Munich airport from [[Regensburg]], Landshut, Moosburg and Freising. The Neufahrner Kurve is to connect the railway line Landshut-Munich from Neufahr with the railway connection line [[Neufahrn Link|Neufahr-Flughafen Munich]], approximately 2.5 kilometres long, two-track and electrified section of the line. In the construction and financing agreement, signed by rail and free-trade in April 2013, it was agreed that the Neufahrn Link will be built and put into operation by the end of 2018. On 9 December 2018, the new train service to Regensburg and Landshut has commenced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wirtschaft-dingolfing-landau.de/erfolg-schienenanbindung-an-flughafen/ | title=Weg frei f\u00fcr eine direkte Schienenanbindung des M\u00fcnchner Flughafens aus Nordostbayern | date=30 August 2013 | website= | publisher=Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung im Landkreis Dingolfing-Landau | language=German | accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Third runway===\n\n====Need for the expansion project====\nAccording to the airport, the growth of air traffic in Munich from 1997 to 2006 was an average of 7% per year, and the airport's capacity was already exhausted.

It has two passenger terminals with an additional midfield terminal, two runways as well as extensive cargo and maintenance facilities and is fully equipped to handle wide-body aircraft including the [[Airbus A380]].\n\n==History==\n===Development===\n[[File:Sud_SE-210_Caravelle_10B3_Super_B,_Air_Toulouse_AN0204076.jpg|thumb|An [[Air Toulouse]] [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] at Munich Airport in 1993 with the construction site of today's [[Hilton Munich Airport]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Munich (- Franz Josef Strauss) (MUC - EDDM) AN0174880.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Terminal 1 in 2001, when Terminal 2 was not yet operational.]]\nMunich's previous airport, [[Munich-Riem Airport]], was operational from 1939 to 1992. Initial plans for an expansion of the airport date back to the year 1954. With rising passenger numbers and a growing number of inhabitants in its proximity, plans were made to completely move the airport to another site. The Bavarian government took the decision to build a new airport in the area called \"Erdinger Moos\" on 5 August 1969. When construction started on 3 November 1980, the small village of Franzheim disappeared and its approximately 400 inhabitants were resettled. The airport is located on the territory of four different municipalities: [[Oberding]] (location of the terminals; [[Erding (district)|district of Erding]]), [[Hallbergmoos]], [[Freising]], and [[Marzling]] in the [[Freising (district)|district of Freising]].\n\nThe new Munich airport commenced operations on 17 May 1992, and all flights to and from Munich were moved to the new site overnight. Munich-Riem closed on 16 May 1992 shortly before midnight.\n\nThe airport is named after [[Franz Josef Strauss]], who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial, role in West German politics from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Amongst other positions, Strauss was a long-time [[Minister-President]] (Governor) of the state of [[Bavaria]]. Strauss, a private pilot himself, initiated the new airport project and was particularly interested in attracting the aviation industry to Bavaria. He is regarded as one of the fathers of the [[Airbus]] project and served as initial chairman of the Airbus supervisory board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/|title=Early days (1967\u20131969)|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195621/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/|archive-date=5 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFlughafen M\u00fcnchen [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]], which owns and operates Munich Airport, is a limited liability company consisting of three shareholders: the State of Bavaria (51%), the Federal Republic of Germany (26%) and the City of Munich (23%). The logo of Munich Airport consists of the letter \"M\" with the slogan \"Living ideas \u2013 Connecting lives\". Munich Airport is usually referred to as \"Flughafen M\u00fcnchen\" or simply \"MUC\", its IATA code. During construction the airport was referred to as \"Flughafen M\u00fcnchen II\".\n\n===Operations===\nAs their home base at [[Frankfurt Airport]] suffered from capacity limits back then, [[Lufthansa]] established a second hub offering several short- and long-haul connections through Munich in addition to Frankfurt. While Lufthansa serves more European destinations from Munich Airport than from Frankfurt Airport, Frankfurt has many more intercontinental routes.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million,<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Munich's traffic doubles in 10 years; Lufthansa adds more routes than it drops as a host of new airlines announce new services|date=20 April 2010|url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/04/20/munichs-traffic-doubles-in-10-years/ |work=anna.aero}}</ref> despite the impact of the [[11 September attacks]] in 2001 and 2002. In 1996 the airport overtook [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport|D\u00fcsseldorf]] as Germany's second-busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the country's third-busiest airport.\n\nIn June 2003, construction of Terminal 2 was completed and it was inaugurated as an exclusive facility for Lufthansa and its [[Star Alliance]] partners.\n\nIn November 2013, the airport introduced its first new [[corporate design]] since its inauguration. The large letter 'M' remains in a new font type, and a dash has been added which changes between several colors. There are also animated color-changing versions of the 'M'-sign placed throughout the airport area, for example on the main entrance road and on the new Terminal 2 satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designtagebuch.de/flughafen-muenchen-erhaelt-neues-corporate-design/|title=Flughafen M\u00fcnchen erh\u00e4lt neues Corporate Design|author=Achim Schaffrinna|work=Design Tagebuch|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] announced it intends to establish a long-haul base at Munich Airport from the 2016 summer season.

It is followed by the west apron and Terminal 1, then the Munich Airport Center (MAC), Terminal 2 and the east apron.

It has a total capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is subdivided into five ''modules'' designated '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''' and '''E'''. Modules A through D provide all facilities necessary to handle departures and arrivals, including individual landside driveways and parking, whereas module E is equipped to handle arrivals only. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own. Modules A and D are used for flights within the Schengen-area, while modules B and C handle those to destinations outside it. '''Hall F''' is separate, located near Terminal 2, and handles flights with increased security requirements, i.e. those to [[Israel]]. Furthermore, the check-in counters for some flights departing from Terminal 1 are located in the central area '''Z''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Zentralbereich}}) where most of the shopping and restaurant facilities of this Terminal as well as the airport's suburban railway station are also located.\n\nThe {{convert|1081|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid}} pier features 21 [[jet bridge]]s, two of which have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. One gate position has been equipped with three jet bridges to handle the [[Airbus A380]] which is regularly used by [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]]. There are further 60 aircraft stands on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially designed apron jet bridges ({{lang-de|link=no|Vorfeldfluggastbr\u00fccken}}), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investment required for full [[satellite terminal]]s connected through a [[people mover|passenger transport system]].\n\nTerminal 1 currently handles all airlines that are not members or partners of the [[Star Alliance]] with the exception of [[Turkish Airlines]]. However, owing to lack of capacity at Terminal 2, Lufthansa's subsidiary [[Germanwings]] and former affiliate [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] both moved back to Terminal 1 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmm.travel/news/artikel/lesen/2007/07/germanwings-wechselt-terminals-in-muenchen-10511/|title=Germanwings wechselt Terminals in M\u00fcnchen|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415030917/http://dmm.travel/news/artikel/lesen/2007/07/germanwings-wechselt-terminals-in-muenchen-10511/|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-one.net/news/produkt/article/muenchen-condor-kuenftig-im-terminal-1/|title=Travel ONE: Produkt|work=travel-one.net|accessdate=2 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040447/http://www.travel-one.net/news/produkt/article/muenchen-condor-kuenftig-im-terminal-1/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Germanwings however moved back to Terminal 2 in late 2015.

Terminal areas A and B will be entirely redesigned with the addition of a {{Convert|320|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} pier stretching out on the apron. The new facilities will provide capacity for 6 million additional passengers, will be able to handle 12 aircraft including two Airbus A380s at once, and are due to open by 2022.<ref>[http://www.aero.de/news-25446/Terminal-1-wird-fuer-400-Millionen-Euro-erweitert.html aero.de \u2013 \"Terminal 1 to be extended for \u20ac400m\"] (German) 19 November 2016</ref>\n\n===Terminal 2===\n[[File:Munich (- Franz Josef Strauss) (MUC - EDDM) AN0517640.jpg|thumb|Check-in area at Terminal 2, the notable hanging sculpture advertising [[BMW]] has since been removed]]\n[[File:Airport Munich innen 2009 PD 20090404 036.JPG|thumb|Boarding gate area at Terminal 2]]\nTerminal 2 commenced operation on 29 June 2003. It has a design capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is exclusively used by [[Lufthansa]] and all other [[Star Alliance]] members serving Munich except [[Turkish Airlines]]. Star Alliance partners [[Air Malta]], [[Luxair]] and [[BMI Regional]] also use Terminal 2. [[Etihad Airways]] relocated to this terminal as well after commencing a partnership with Lufthansa.\n\nHaving been designed as a hub terminal it is not divided into modules like Terminal 1. Instead, all facilities are arranged around a central ''Plaza''. Owing to security regulations imposed by the European Union, the terminal has been equipped with facilities to handle passengers from countries considered insecure, i.e. not implementing the same regulations. This required the construction of a new level as, unlike other airports, the terminal does not have separate areas for arriving and departing passengers. The new level 06 opened on 15 January 2009.\n\nThe pier, which is {{convert|980|m|abbr=on}} long, is equipped with 24 jet bridges. As the total number of 75 aircraft stands on the east apron is not always sufficient, Terminal 2 sometimes also uses parking positions on the west apron, to which passengers are carried by airside buses. Terminal 2 is able to handle the [[Airbus A380]] as well, however, prior to the opening of the Terminal 2 satellite building, there were no designated stands or additional jet bridges for it. Lufthansa flies the A380 into the satellite building.<ref>[https://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2017/06/13/lufthansa-a380-munich/ onemileatatime.boardingarea.com] retrieved 14 June 2018</ref>\n\nTerminal 2 has two main departure levels, 04 and 05 and additional bus gates on the lower level 03. Gates on level 05 ('''H''') are designated non-Schengen gates. Until the new transfer level 06 opened, the northernmost gates were behind an additional security checkpoint for departures to the USA most of the day. The lower level 04 ('''G''') contains Schengen gates. The bus gates on level 03 are also designated '''G''' and are also used for Schengen flights. Level 03 is smaller than the main levels and consists of two separate parts which can be reached from two points on level 04. One area of these gates is designated to [[Air Dolomiti]].\n\nThe terminal is operated by ''Terminal-2-Betriebsgesellschaft'' (German for ''Terminal 2 Operating Company''), which is owned by Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH (60%) and Lufthansa (40%). This makes Terminal 2 the first terminal in Germany which is co-operated by an airline.\n\n===Terminal 2 Satellite===\n[[File:Satellite_2_muc.png|thumb|Terminal 2 Satellite building still under construction]]\nTerminal 2 was projected to reach its full capacity of handling 27.5 million passengers a year by 2013. Lufthansa and [[Star Alliance]] partners stipulated the expansion of Terminal 2 without constructing the separate facilities for luggage claim, arrival and departure levels, etc. This was to ensure the easy access for the passengers who appreciate the convenience of central plaza for checking in their luggage, going through the security screening, and such as well as transferring from one plane to other within Lufthansa and Star Alliance partner networks inside Terminal 2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/index.jsp |title=Startklar f\u00fcr die Zukunft, Ein Satellit f\u00fcr das Terminal 2 |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219225530/http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/index.jsp |archive-date=19 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/freising/erdinger-moos-flughafen-modernisiert-terminal-1.1109496 |title=Erdinger Moos \u2013 Flughafen modernisiert Terminal 1 |work=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung |date=17 June 2011 |last=V\u00f6lklein |first=Marcos}}</ref> After the completion of Terminal 2 in 2003, the preparations for a new satellite terminal already had been made.\n\nThe project cost is 650 million Euro with Munich Airport contributing 60% and Lufthansa 40% toward the project.<ref name=\"satellitefacts\">[http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/facts/index.jsp munich-airport.de \u2013 Daten und Fakten zum Satelliten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023233929/http://www.munich-airport.de/de/company/konzern/ausbau/satellit/facts/index.jsp |date=23 October 2015 }} retrieved 6 December 2015</ref> The expansion would handle additional 11 million passengers per year.

No further detail about number of gates along with construction and completion dates is given yet.\n\n===Munich Airport Center===\n[[File:munich airport central.jpg|thumb|Munich Airport Center]]\nThe Munich Airport Center (sometimes shortened to ''MAC'') is a shopping, business, and recreation area that connects the terminals. The older ''Central Area'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Zentralbereich}}), which was originally built as part of Terminal 1, hosts a shopping mall and the [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] station. The newer ''MAC Forum'' built with Terminal 2 is a large outdoor area with a partly transparent tent-like roof. Next to it is the airport hotel managed by [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] which was designed by the world-famous architect [[Helmut Jahn]] and landscape architecture firm [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|PWP Landscape Architecture]] in 1994.\n\nThe Munich Airport Center has a supermarket where one can shop from 5:30&nbsp;a.m. to midnight every day, including sundays,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/shops/a-z/E/edeka_Z/index.jsp |title=Munich Airport \u2013 Edeka |publisher=Munich-airport.de |accessdate=4 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227190905/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/shops/a-z/E/edeka_Z/index.jsp |archivedate=27 December 2013  }}</ref> as it is exempt from the Bavarian law governing retail hours of operation ({{lang-de| [[Ladenschlussgesetz]]}}).<ref>[[Ladenschlussgesetz]]</ref>\n\n===Runways===\nThe airport has two parallel runways and one concrete [[helipad]]. The two concrete runways (08R/26L and 26R/08L) are each {{convert|4000|m|sigfig=4}} long and {{convert|60|m|sigfig=2}} wide.<ref name=\"2012-facts\">[http://www.munich-airport.de/media/download/general/publikationen/en/facts_and_figures.pdf Munich Airport Facts and Figures: 2011/2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023703/http://www.munich-airport.de/media/download/general/publikationen/en/facts_and_figures.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Planned third runway====\nA third runway would increase the number of scheduled aircraft movements per hour from 90 to 120.<ref>[http://www.munich-airport.de/media/download/general/publikationen/en/facts_and_figures.pdf MUC Airport \u2013 Facts and Figures 2010/2011 (p.10)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023703/http://www.munich-airport.de/media/download/general/publikationen/en/facts_and_figures.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> It would run in parallel to the existing runways and be located to the north-east of the current north runway, significantly extending the total area occupied by the airport. According to ''Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH'' (''FMG''), the airport's operator, the current two-runway system is already operating at full capacity during peak hours, and requests for additional slots from airlines have been denied. Further increase in air traffic is expected as Munich is to become a second major hub in Germany after [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]].\n\nIn August 2007, the airport operator applied for planning permission from the government of [[Upper Bavaria]]. More than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans. The objections and lawsuits against the third runway were later overturned by the Bavarian Administrative Court, allowing for construction plans to proceed.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, the government of Upper Bavaria issued the zoning approval for the construction of a third runway. With this decision, the zoning authority, after the intensive examination and consideration of all ramifications, expressly approved the need presented by Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH and the plans submitted for the third runway. Also tied to the approval by the government of Upper Bavaria is the prompt completion of the construction project. However, the airport operator has chosen to follow the advice of Bavaria's Higher Administrative Court and not to proceed until the principal proceedings concerning the project have reached a conclusion. The decision is currently being reviewed by the court. The building permit associated with the zoning will continue to be valid for up to 15 years.\n\nWhile according to [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] Regulations (Annex XIV) the new runway would have to be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muc-ausbau.de/downloads/gutachten_PFV/B001_LU_01Techn_Beschreibg.pdf|author=DC Airports|title=Erl\u00e4uterungsbericht Technische Planung Luftseite|work=Planfeststellungsverfahren 3.

The plans include a new {{Convert|4000|m|ft|adj=mid}} runway northeast of the existing airport and a new satellite building at Terminal 2, the latter of which did open in April 2016. However, construction of the new runway may yet be delayed as the project has to have unanimous approval by the airport's three shareholders: Bavaria, Federal Republic of Germany and the City of Munich. The latter has opposed the plan since a 2012 referendum.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Green Light for Munich Expansion|journal=Airliner World|date=October 2015|page=8}}</ref>\n\n===Parking areas===\n[[File:Parkhaus.JPG|thumb|Parking garage in front of [[Munich Airport#Terminal 1|Terminal&nbsp;1]]]]\nCurrently, there are five parking garages and six underground parking areas, amounting together to a total of 30,000 parking spaces<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/parkbereiche/index.jsp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420095853/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/parkbereiche/index.jsp| url-status=dead| archive-date=20 April 2013| title=Parking areas| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> of which approximately 16,500 are under a roof. The parking garage P20 at Terminal 2, with 6,400 parking spaces on eleven levels (including four that are underground) since its commissioning in 2003 was the largest parking garage in Germany until the car park at the new [[Allianz Arena]] was opened in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bfk-architekten.de/projekte/parkhaeuser/parkhaus-airport-muenchen/ | title=Parkhaus Airport | publisher=BFK Architekten | language=German | accessdate=27 May 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527163051/http://bfk-architekten.de/projekte/parkhaeuser/parkhaus-airport-muenchen/ | archivedate=27 May 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A parking guidance system was installed in the parking garages, which detects whether a parking space is occupied and newly arriving vehicles are shown where the empty parking spaces are located.\n\nApart from the usual parking facilities, the Munich Airport offers, at additional cost, special parking spaces with additional benefits. This includes [[valet parking]], in which the vehicle is picked up by an airport employee upon flight departure and parked, and the Park, Sleep & Fly option, in which a night at the Hilton hotel is included. Also there is an option for oversized parking spaces, the so-called XXL parking, and secure parking. Lastly, there is a special separate parking level in the P20 parking garage, where the parked cars are guarded. In addition, special services can be booked, such as interior/exterior cleaning and fuelling.\n\nTo make shopping in the public areas more attractive for local residents of the airport area, there are special offers where visitors can park up to three hours for free in the P20 parking garage.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/aktionsspecial/parken_shopping/index.jsp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115170303/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/anab/auto/parken/aktionsspecial/parken_shopping/index.jsp| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2014| title=Parking and shopping| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> Short-term parking can be found east of the central area, where visitors can park for free for a maximum of thirty minutes. During the holiday periods other cheaper options are provided in the P8 parking garage.\n\n===Visitor viewing facilities===\n[[File:Besucherzentrum.jpg|thumb|''Visitors Park'' at Munich Airport]]\nThe airport authorities have set out to cater for visitors and sightseers by creating a 'Visitors Park' which includes a 'Visitors Hill', from which a good view of the westerly aircraft apron and Terminal 1 can be obtained, as well as a restaurant and a shop for aircraft models and other collectors' items. This location is served by a railway station named '[[Munich Airport Besucherpark station|Besucherpark]]'. The view from the hill is shown in the above widescreen image of the Terminal 1 apron. Three historic aircraft are on display in the park, a [[Super Constellation]], a [[Douglas DC-3]], and a [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m]].\n\nThere is also a visitors' viewing terrace on the roof of Terminal 2 that features a wide, glassed balcony with seating areas and gives a view of the easterly aircraft apron. All visitors can access the terrace from the landside. The entrance fee was abolished in September 2013. There are two additional smaller ''Visitor Hills'' on the north end of the north runway and at the center of the south runway.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Munich Airport:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/fluginfo/flugsuche1/index.jsp|title=Munich Airport \u2013 Flightsearch/Timetable|publisher=Munich Airport|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE ROUTES WITHOUT GIVING A VALID SOURCE.

It developed a so-called \"four-pillar strategy\" with an overall concept designed to improve environmental protection; these four pillars include:\n\n:\"Reduction of CO2 emissions through technological progress and innovation, particularly in the field of engine development; a more efficient infrastructure with a needs-based adaptation of airport capacity with concentration on the avoidance of, for example, polluting queues; operational measures such as the optimization of soil processes; economic incentives\"\n:\u2014Perspectives.

At the opening of the airport, 70% of the grounds were planted; today there are 925 of the 1,575 hectares which remained planted, only 60%.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/facts/allg/index.jsp| title=General information| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123111/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/facts/allg/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The prevalent Erdinger Moos area with its many intersecting small streams, and woodland series was taking into consideration in the planning by the landscape architect. At the same time, consideration was taking in making the airport unattractive to birds, in order to prevent [[bird strike]]s. An additional 230-acre green belt was placed around the airport as a compensation area, in which the overall compensation areas extend over 600 acres.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/konzept/index.jsp| title=Landscape concept and planning| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123015/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/konzept/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Even with the focus on the environment, environmental groups criticize the enormous [[land consumption]] of the airport and each additional expansion project. Also, they believe that the compensation areas are not sufficient enough in order to compensate for the damage caused by the airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bund-naturschutz-erding.de/pages/taufkirchen_landverbrauch.htm | title=Bauernverband und BN kritisieren Landverbrauch | website= | publisher=Bund Naturschutz Kreisgruppe Erding | language=German | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\nThe construction in the Erdinger Moos area had a large impact on the water budget of the region, since the [[groundwater]] levels in the [[marsh]]y landscape had to be greatly reduced by creating drainage ditches. Existing watercourses, such as small streams, were not interrupted, but redirected so that they now run either around or underneath the property, limiting the effects of groundwater reduction to only the areas in which the airport is located.\n\nThe wastewater from the airport and the collected rain water are both returned to the natural water cycle. In order to accomplish this, 100&nbsp;km of sewer lines were laid, and seven pumping stations, a water treatment plant and four rainwater sedimentation tanks were built and put into operation. The already rough cleansed water is then sent to a purification plant. For the necessary winter de-icing of the airport, used deicing chemicals such as glycol are collected together with the contaminated melted water, and then either purified or reused. The cleaning is done in the degradation system area, where soil bacteria decompose the glycol into harmless components of water and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/ressourcen/index.jsp| title=Water management| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217130143/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/ressourcen/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Noise===\n;General\nTo reduce noise from [[thrust reversal]] during aircraft landings, the runways were built to a length of 4,000 meters, however the noise reduction is offset by increased taxiing times. To reduce noise pollution, a hall for engine testing was built. After 11 p.m. engine tests may be carried out only with the approval of air traffic control. To motivate airlines to use low-noise aircraft, the airport charges are calculated according to the level of noise pollution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://derstandard.at/2993931 | title=\"L\u00e4rmsteuer\" f\u00fcr laute Flugzeuge | date=11 September 2007 | website= | work=Der Standard| language=German | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> There are 16 stationary noise measuring points at the airport.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/index.jsp| title=Noise control| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217123254/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n;Night flight regulations\nAt Munich airport there is no strict ban on night flights, but a ban on flights arriving and departing between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.. The only exemptions are flights from mail services and DFS survey flights. From midnight until 5am only those flights that operate in the interest of the public are generally possible, this includes so-called emergency flights: police and rescue helicopter missions or medical emergencies. Also, aircraft movements for security reasons such as for precautionary landings are allowed at all times. Flights with special permission from the Bavarian Ministry for Economic Affairs, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology are also feasible at this time.\n\nFrom 10 p.m. to midnight and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. flights are possible through the so-called bonus list. Exceptions are delayed flights or premature landings if these aircraft are at least noise-admitted according to ICAO Chapter 3. In addition to both the bonus list and noise requirements they must fulfill further conditions, this includes that the airline must have a maintenance base at the airport, the maximum number of 28 scheduled flights per night (charter and scheduled services) must not be exceeded, the aircraft is not louder than 75 db (A) or it is an education or training flight.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/nachtflug/index.jsp| title=Night flight operations| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=17 December 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217122609/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/laerm/nachtflug/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis rule applies until the total annual volume is exhausted in air traffic movements by these regulations. More flights of this type are then no longer allowed. The number of night flights increased from 1999 to 2007 from 42 to 60 flights average per night.<ref name=\"perspectives\" />\n\nResidents have been protesting for years against aircraft noise, in particular against the noise pollution at night. The Government of Upper Bavaria approved the night flight regulations currently in force in 2001.\n\n===Energy===\n;Cogeneration plant\nMost of Munich airport's electricity and heat is generated by its own [[cogeneration]] plant (CHP), which is located south of the northern runway to the west of the airport. CHP has nine so-called cogeneration modules, seven run on diesel fuel, the other two on gasoline. The electrical generating capacity is 18.5 megawatts. The cogeneration modules run smoothly all year long; this creates surplus heat at certain times which is stored in heat storage to be used later. In summer, the heat generated is used for the operation of the absorption refrigerating machine. The total gross utilization rate is 78 percent (diesel) and 83 percent (gasoline).

It is a joint project of [[BP Solar]], [[BP|German BP]], ''Bundesdeutscher Arbeitskreis f\u00fcr Umweltbewusstes Management'', [[Lufthansa]], Munich Airport and others. In operation since 10 July 2003, it generates an average of 445,000 [[kilowatt hour]]s per year, equivalent to the consumption of 155 households.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.airport-world.com/news/general-news/2813-lufthansa-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-solar-panels-at-munich-airport.html | title=Lufthansa celebrates 10th Anniversary of Solar Panels at Munich Airport | date=2 July 2013 | website= | publisher=Airport World | accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> The power comes from 2,856 modules of silicon cells, covering a total area of 3,594 square metres.

This led automatically to the area being reported under the European Birds Directive as a bird sanctuary.\n\nThe fencing of the airport and the large meadows inside the fence attract open meadow birds. This leads to constant conflicts and the deaths, even of rare birds as a result of airplane accidents (vortices) and safety measures to avoid [[bird strike]]s. The planned third runway 3,440,000 square metres in the bird sanctuary will be laid with concrete, eliminating 8,000,000 square metres of living space. This would represent substantial interference with the bird sanctuary.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/index.jsp| title=Biodiversity| publisher=Munich Airport| accessdate=12 January 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217150416/http://www.munich-airport.de/en/company/umwelt/bio/index.jsp| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n===Police===\n[[File:Polizeihubschrauber Bayern.JPG|thumb|[[Eurocopter EC135]], the police helicopter squad of Bavaria at Munich Airport]]\nFor the safety of passengers and flight operations, four<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bundespolizei.de/Web/DE/05Die-Bundespolizei/03Organisation/02Direktionen/Muenchen/muenchen_node.html | title=Bundespolizeidirektion M\u00fcnchen | website= | publisher=Bundespolizei | language=German | accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref> inspections by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]], departments of the [[Bavarian State Police]] (Police Inspection Munich Airport, PP Oberbayern Nord) and the security department of Flughafen M\u00fcnchen GmbH are responsible.

A second station called ''[[Munich Airport Besucherpark station|Besucherpark]]'' (German for ''Visitors' Park'') is located in the area that contains the cargo and maintenance areas, long-term parking, administrative buildings and the Visitors' Park from which the station gets its name.\n\nThe airport is connected to the city by [[Munich S-Bahn|Munich suburban railway]] (''S-Bahn'') lines {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} and {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S8}}. The ride takes approximately 45 minutes to the Marienplatz station in the city centre. {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} runs from the airport through the northwestern suburbs and reaches the city centre from the west ([[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]] \u2013 [[M\u00fcnchen Marienplatz station|Marienplatz]] \u2013 [[M\u00fcnchen Ost station|M\u00fcnchen Ost]]), while {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S8}} comes in from the eastern suburbs passing the stations from the opposite direction.

This new connection enabled hourly regional express train services from [[Regensburg]] via [[Landshut]] directly to the airport without the need to use a connecting bus coming from the north or to go to Munich city center at first and then backtracking to the airport. The entire project was completed in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wochenblatt.de/politik/regensburg/artikel/265617/in-75-minuten-von-regensburg-zum-muenchner-flughafen |title=Neue Zugverbindung: In 75 Minuten von Regensburg zum M\u00fcnchner Flughafen |date=16 November 2018 |publisher=Wochen Blatt |author=Bayern Bahnland |language=German}}</ref> On 9 December 2018, the new hourly service, ''Flughafenexpress'' (''airport express'') between Regensburg and Munich Airport commenced.\n\n===Bus===\n[[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund|MVV]] regional bus lines connect the airport to the nearby city of [[Freising]] as well as [[Erding]] and [[Markt Schwaben]].

At an estimated cost of between 500 million and 2 billion [[Deutsche Mark]], each option would have allowed the airport to be integrated into the [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] network.<ref>{{cite book | date=1992 | title=Ein Jahr Hochgeschwindigkeitsverkehr | language=German | publisher=Deutsche Bahn | pages=4\u20136 }}</ref> However, the idea was rejected and instead concentration was placed on a better connection of the airport to regional transportation as well as to the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]].\n\n====Airport Express (S-Bahn)====\nAfter the cancellation of Transrapid proposal, several alternative proposals had been put forward that would utilise the current railway system with minor technical upgrades.\n\nOne proposal called \"Humpel-Express\" would utilise the most of current [[Munich-Regensburg railway]] and S1 lines with very limited stops along the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/freising/warten-auf-den-humpel-express-schneller-zum-airport-1.3073545 |title=Wo bleibt der \"Humpel-Express\"? |author=Alexandra Vettori |date=11 July 2016 |publisher=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung |language=German}}</ref> The \"Humpel-Express\" would travel at 200&nbsp;km/h and depart the Central Station and Munich Airport at 15-minute interval. The biggest issue was frequent level crossing closures at Fasanerie and Feldmoching (total of 39 minutes for every hour), causing the severe traffic congestions. Additionally, the construction of new line between Moosach and Munich Airport would cut through several towns and neighbourhoods, which the residents vehemently opposed. The new line also required the construction of new viaduct over the federal highway B471, increasing the cost further. The opposition from the resident and unwillingness to allot additional funding killed the proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merkur.de/lokales/muenchen/stadt-muenchen/airport-prueft-einen-eigenen-schnellzug-trasse-s1-mm-5862599.html |language=German |date=13 November 2015 |publisher=M\u00fcnchner Merkur |author=Johannes Welte and Felix M\u00fcller |title=Geheimplan: Flughafen pr\u00fcft eigene Expressbahn}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Munich S-Bahn#The Second S-Bahn Tunnel (Zweite Stammstrecke)|the Second S-Bahn Tunnel]] under construction, the proposed Airport Express service will peruse second S-Bahn tunnel upon completion with one stop, instead of four, at Marienhof between Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. This would reduce the travel time between Hauptbahnhof and Munich Airport to 30 minutes. Additionally, Deutsche Bahn has proposed the underground four-track S-Bahn tunnel from Leuchtenbergring to Halbergmoos S-Bahn stations. This would eliminate the need to slow down before passing through the intervening stations and the need to close the level crossings frequently. If the four-track extension is approved and constructed, the travel time would be reduced further to 15\u201318 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.ganze-region-will-in-den-mvv-neue-plaene-fuers-netz-das-wird-eine-mega-s-bahn.f0453323-81da-4252-afbb-34e2309692fc.html |title=Ganze Region will in den MVV Neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcrs Netz: das wird eine Mega-S-Bahn |language=German |date=31 March 2017 |publisher=Abendzeitung M\u00fcnchen |author=Florian Zick}}</ref>\n\n====Subway====\nThrough the extension of different [[Munich U-Bahn|subway lines]] to the intersection with one of the two airport suburban railways, the travel time to the airport from different parts of the north of Munich can be considerably reduced. This was realized for the suburbs of [[Milbertshofen-Am Hart]] and [[Feldmoching-Hasenbergl]] with the subway line {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|U2}} to the {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} station Feldmoching in 1996 and the construction of the airport connector near Neufahrn in 1998. In 2010, the travel time to the airport from [[Moosach (Munich)|Moosach]], Schwabing West and [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg]] districts was shortened by connecting the subway line {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|U3}} to the {{\u00d6PNV M\u00fcnchen|S1}} station Moosach.

It will fulfill the demand of a rail connection between Eastern Bavaria, including the neighboring airport commuter cities [[Moosburg]] and [[Landshut]], to the airport, realized with its own regional railway line. A faster connection from the airport to the inner city is not achieved by the Erdinger ring connection, however a direct connection between the airport and the Munich Messe would be. For this, the S2 would also make a short route north of [[Messe M\u00fcnchen]] and have a stop north of the exhibition center.\nAlready before the opening of the airport there were plans for a regional station at the airport. To this, a railway connection from [[M\u00fchldorf]] am [[Inn (river)|Inn]] is to be made between Erding and [[Dorfen]] with the help of the Erdinger ring connection as well as a short new construction single-track called [[Erding Ring Closure|Walpertskirchner Spange]]. The actual planning phase for this also began, as in the case of the Erdinger ring connection, in August 2006.\nOn 29 August 2013, the Bavarian Administrative Court rejected the complaints against the plan approval decision of the [[Neufahrn Link]] of October 2012 and therefore freed the way for a direct rail connection of the Munich airport from [[Regensburg]], Landshut, Moosburg and Freising. The Neufahrner Kurve is to connect the railway line Landshut-Munich from Neufahr with the railway connection line [[Neufahrn Link|Neufahr-Flughafen Munich]], approximately 2.5 kilometres long, two-track and electrified section of the line. In the construction and financing agreement, signed by rail and free-trade in April 2013, it was agreed that the Neufahrn Link will be built and put into operation by the end of 2018. On 9 December 2018, the new train service to Regensburg and Landshut has commenced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wirtschaft-dingolfing-landau.de/erfolg-schienenanbindung-an-flughafen/ | title=Weg frei f\u00fcr eine direkte Schienenanbindung des M\u00fcnchner Flughafens aus Nordostbayern | date=30 August 2013 | website= | publisher=Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung im Landkreis Dingolfing-Landau | language=German | accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Third runway===\n\n====Need for the expansion project====\nAccording to the airport, the growth of air traffic in Munich from 1997 to 2006 was an average of 7% per year, and the airport's capacity was already exhausted.

''It'' was his 22nd book, and his 17th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. \"[[It (character)|It]]\" primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to attract its preferred prey of young children.\n\nThe novel is told through [[Nonlinear narrative|narratives alternating]] between two periods and is largely told in the [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C omniscient|third-person omniscient mode]]. ''It'' deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.\n\nKing has stated that he first conceived the story in 1978, and began writing it in 1981. He finished writing the book in 1985.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/it00king_1 |title=It |last=King, Stephen, 1947- |first= |date=1986 |publisher=Viking |year= |isbn=0670813028 |location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A. |pages=1153 |oclc=13497048 |url-access=registration }}</ref> He also stated that he originally wanted the title character to be a [[troll]] like the one in the children's story \"[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]\", but who inhabited the local [[sewer system]] rather than just the area beneath one bridge. He also wanted the story to interweave the stories of children and the adults they later become.\n\nThe novel won the [[British Fantasy Award]] in 1987, and received nominations for the [[Locus Award|Locus]] and [[World Fantasy Award]]s that same year.<ref name=\"WWE-1987\">{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1987| title = 1987 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed ''It'' as the best-selling hardcover fiction book in the United States in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monaghan|first=Charles|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1987/03/29/book-report/0c0e23d3-5bd0-4b82-8c3b-7cbf68d755a2/|title=BOOK REPORT|date=March 29, 1987|work=The Washington Post|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> ''It'' has been adapted into a [[It (miniseries)|1990 two-part miniseries]] directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]], a [[Woh|1998 television series]] directed by Glen Baretto & Ankush Mohla, and into a film duology directed by [[Andy Muschietti]]; ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' was released in September 2017 and ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' was released in September 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n===1957\u20131958===\nDuring a heavy rainstorm in [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], a six-year-old boy named [[Georgie Denbrough]] sails a paper boat his brother made for him along the rainy streets before it washed down into a storm drain. Peering into the drain, startled from seeing a pair of glowing yellow eyes, Georgie encounters an [[It (character)|eccentric clown]] who introduces himself as \"Mr. Bob Gray,\" a.k.a. \"Pennywise the Dancing Clown.\" Georgie declines a balloon but is enticed by Pennywise to reach into the drain and retrieve his boat, the clown ripping the child's arm off before leaving Georgie to die from [[Exsanguination|bleeding out]]. His body is later discovered and brought back to the Denbrough's house.\n\nThe following June, an overweight eleven-year-old boy named Ben Hanscom is harassed by a bully named Henry Bowers and his gang, escaping into the marshy wasteland known as [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20Barrens|the Barrens]] when attacked by his tormentors on the last day of school. There, Ben befriends an asthmatic hypochondriac named [[Eddie Kaspbrak]] and [[Bill Denbrough|\"Stuttering Bill\" Denbrough]], Georgie's elder brother who suffers from a stutter and rides on a rusty bike named \"Silver.\" The three boys later befriend fellow misfits [[Richie Tozier]], Stanley \"Stan\" Uris, and [[Beverly Marsh]], who eventually refer to themselves as \"The Losers Club.\" As the summer draws on, the Losers each encounter Pennywise in terrifying manifestations: a [[mummy]] on a frozen canal to Ben, a fountain of blood (that only children can see) from Beverly's sink, a diseased and rotting [[leper]] to Eddie, drowned corpses to Stan, and a frightening phantom of Georgie to Bill. The Losers eventually realize they are all being stalked by the same child-killing entity which killed Eddie Corcoran in the form of the [[Gill-man]].\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly unhinged and sadistic Bowers begins focusing his attention on his [[African-American]] neighbor Mike Hanlon and his father. Bowers kills Mike's dog and chases the terrified boy into the Barrens, where he joins the Losers in driving Bowers' gang off in a rock fight, a humiliated Bowers vowing revenge. Mike reveals his own encounter with Pennywise in the form of a flesh-eating bird while showing the Losers his historical scrapbook; the group realizes that \"It\" is a monster with a hold on the town. Following further encounters with It, the Losers construct a makeshift [[smoke hole]] that Richie and Mike use to hallucinate It's origins as an ancient alien entity that came to Earth in a meteor and feeds on children for a year before entering a 27-year-long hibernation.\n\nIn late July, after Eddie is hospitalized by Bowers and several of his friends, Beverly witnesses one of the bullies, Patrick Hockstetter, killed by It in the form of a mass of leeches while emptying a refrigerator he used to trap and kill injured animals. The Losers later discover a message from It written in Patrick's blood, warning them that It will kill them if they interfere. After Eddie is released from the hospital with a broken arm, Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar on the belief that silver will harm It. The story's narrative changes to Pennywise's perspective at that point, revealing It as a being from another reality known as the Macroverse that nourishes itself on fear from terrorizing children in the forms It assumes.\n\nThe Losers travel to the house on Neibolt Street, where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It, forcing Pennywise to flee into the sewers after Losers wound It with the silver [[slug]] while in the form of a [[werewolf]]. Deeming the Losers a threat, It provides Bowers with a [[switchblade]] while manipulating him into murdering his abusive father and recruiting his friends Victor \"Vic\" Criss and Reginald \"Belch\" Huggins into helping him follow the Losers into the sewers to kill them. But Vic and Belch are both killed by It in the form of [[Frankenstein's monster]] while a traumatized Bowers gets himself lost in the sewers. In the sewers, Bill performs the \"Ritual of Ch\u00fcd\" he learned to face It in the Macroverse where he meets the monster's antithesis Maturin, an ancient turtle that created the universe (which it vomited up following a stomach-ache), who explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills.\n\nBill enters It's mind through the ritual and sees the true form of It, a mass of destructive orange lights called the \"Deadlights\" before Bill defeats the monster with Maturin's help. After the battle, not knowing if they killed It or not, the Losers get lost in the sewers until they take part in an [[orgy]] to bring unity back to the group.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/top-5-sickest-stephen-king-sex-scenes-nsfw-6371394|title=Top 5 Sickest Stephen King Sex Scenes (NSFW)|last=Rouner|first=Jef|work=[[Houston Press]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The Losers then swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] to return to Derry should It resurface. Bowers, having lost his sanity by the time he washed out of the sewers into a nearby river, is institutionalized after being blamed for the child murders.\n\n=== 1984\u20131985 ===\nIn July 1984, at the annual Derry carnival, three youths brutally attack a young man named Adrian Mellon and throw him off a bridge. They are arrested and charged with murder when Mellon's mutilated corpse is found. One of the murderers claims that he saw an eccentric clown kill Mellon underneath the bridge. Adrian's boyfriend, Don Hagarty, the other victim in the attack, had also noticed the clown, but the prosecutors convince him not to mention it during the trial.\n\nWhen a string of violent child killings occurs in Derry once again, an adult Mike Hanlon, now the town's librarian and the only one of the Losers to remain in Derry, calls up the six former members of the Losers Club and reminds them of their childhood promise to return should the killings start again. Bill Denbrough is now a successful horror writer living in England with his actress wife, Audra. Beverly Marsh is a fashion designer in Chicago, who has married an abusive man named Tom Rogan, who is similar to her abusive father. Eddie Kaspbrak has moved to New York City, where he runs a limousine rental company and has married a hysterical codependent woman similar to his hypochondriac mother. Richie Tozier lives in Los Angeles and works as a disc jockey. Ben Hanscom is now thin and a successful but lonely architect, living in Nebraska. Stan Uris is a wealthy accountant residing in Atlanta, Georgia, and is married to a teacher named Patty Blum. Prior to Mike's phone calls, all of the Losers had completely forgotten each other and the trauma of their childhood, burying the horror of their encounters with It. However, all but Stan reluctantly agree to return to Derry. After Mike's phone call, Stan is in such fear at the thought of facing It again that he slits his wrists in the bathtub, writing \"IT\" on the wall in his own blood. Tom refuses to let Beverly go and tries to beat her, but she lashes out at him before fleeing, causing him serious injury. The five return to Derry with only the dimmest awareness of why they are doing so, remembering only absolute terror and their promise to return.\n\nThe Losers meet for lunch in a Chinese restaurant, where Mike reminds them that It awakens once roughly every 27 years for 12\u201316 months at a time, feeding on children before going into slumber again. The group decides to kill It once and for all. At Mike's suggestion, each person explores different parts of Derry to help restore their memories. While exploring, Eddie, Richie, Beverly, and Ben are faced with manifestations of It (Eddie as Belch Huggins and childhood friends in leper and zombified forms, Richie as a [[Paul Bunyan]] statue, Beverly as the witch from [[Hansel & Gretel]] in her childhood home, and Ben as [[Dracula]] in the Derry Library). Bill finds his childhood bicycle, \"Silver,\" and brings it to Mike's.\n\nThree other people are also converging on the town: Audra, who is worried about Bill; Tom, who plans to kill Beverly; and Henry Bowers, who has escaped from Juniper Hill Mental Asylum with help from It. Mike and Henry have a violent confrontation at the library. Mike is nearly killed, but Henry escapes, severely injured. Henry is driven to the hotel, where It instructs him to kill the rest of the Losers. Henry first attacks Eddie, breaking his arm once again, but in the fight, Henry is killed.\n\nIt appears to Tom and orders him to capture Audra. Tom brings Audra to It's lair. Upon seeing It's true form, Audra becomes [[catatonic]], and Tom drops dead in shock. Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, and Eddie learn that Mike is near death and realize they are being forced into another confrontation with It. They descend into the sewers and use their strength as a group to \"send energy\" to a hospitalized Mike, who fights off a nurse that is under the control of It. They reach It's lair and find It has taken the form of a giant spider. Bill and Richie enter It's mind through the Ritual of Ch\u00fcd, but they get lost in It. In order to distract It and bring Bill and Richie back, Eddie runs towards It and uses his aspirator to spray medicine in It's eye and down It's throat. Although he is successful, It bites off Eddie's arm, and Eddie dies due to blood loss. It runs away to tend to its injuries, but Bill, Richie, and Ben chase after and find that It has laid eggs. Ben stays behind to destroy the eggs, while Bill and Richie head toward their final confrontation with It. Bill fights his way inside It's body and locates It's heart and destroys it. The group meets up to head out of It's lair, and although they try to bring Audra and Eddie's bodies with them, they are forced to leave Eddie behind. They make it to the surface and realize that the scars on their hands from when they were children have disappeared, indicating that their ordeal is finally over.\n\nAt the same time, the worst storm in Maine's history sweeps through Derry, and the downtown area collapses. Mike concludes that Derry is finally dying. The Losers return home and gradually begin to forget about It, Derry, and each other. Mike's memory of the events of that summer also begins to fade, as well as any of the records he had written down previously, much to his relief, and he considers starting a new life elsewhere. Ben and Beverly leave together and become a couple, and Richie returns to California. Bill is the last to leave Derry. Before he goes, he takes Audra, still catatonic, for a ride on Silver, which awakens her from her catatonia, and they share a kiss.\n(Eddie Kasprak is the best character in my opinion.

One evening, King ventured alone to pick up his car from the repair shop and came across an old wooden bridge, \"humped and oddly quaint\". Walking along the bridge caused King to recall the story of \"[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]\", and the idea of transplanting the tale's scenario into a real-life context interested him. King was further inspired by a line by [[Marianne Moore]] concerning \"real toads in imaginary gardens\", which in his mind came out as \"real trolls in imaginary gardens\". King would return to the concept two years later and gradually accumulated ideas and thoughts, particularly the concept of weaving the narratives of children and the adults they become. King began writing ''It'' in 1981,<ref name=\"Inspiration\">{{cite web |url=http://stephenking.com/library/novel/it_inspiration.html |title=StephenKing.com \u2013 IT Inspiration |website=stephenking.com}}</ref> and finished the book four years later.<ref name=\"Smythe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/may/28/rereading-stephen-king-it |title=Rereading Stephen King, chapter 21: ''It'' |publisher=The Guardian |author=James Smythe |date=May 28, 2013 |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> King found influence in the mythology and history surrounding the construction of the sewer system in [[Bangor, Maine]].<ref name=\"Hendrix\">{{cite web |url=https://www.tor.com/2013/09/25/the-great-stephen-king-reread-it/ |title=The Great Stephen King Reread: ''It'' |publisher=Tor.com |author=Grady Hendrix |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n''It'' thematically focuses on the loss of childhood innocence<ref name=\"Smythe\"/> and questions the difference between necessity and free will.<ref name=\"Lehman Haupt\"/> Grady Hendrix of Tor.com described the book as being \"about the fact that some doors only open one way, and that while there\u2019s an exit out of childhood named sex, there\u2019s no door leading the other way that turns adults back into children\".<ref name=\"Hendrix\"/> Christopher Lehman-Haupt of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that ''It'' \"concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution\", and that the novel's setting \"is a museum filled with the popular culture of the 1950s: brand names, rock 'n' roll songs and stars, the jokes and routines of childhood in that era\".<ref name=\"Lehman Haupt\"/> James Smythe of ''[[The Guardian]]'' opined that \"Pennywise isn't the novel's biggest terror.

''It'' was his 22nd book, and his 17th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. \"[[It (character)|It]]\" primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to attract its preferred prey of young children.\n\nThe novel is told through [[Nonlinear narrative|narratives alternating]] between two periods and is largely told in the [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C omniscient|third-person omniscient mode]]. ''It'' deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.\n\nKing has stated that he first conceived the story in 1978, and began writing it in 1981. He finished writing the book in 1985.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/it00king_1 |title=It |last=King, Stephen, 1947- |first= |date=1986 |publisher=Viking |year= |isbn=0670813028 |location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A. |pages=1153 |oclc=13497048 |url-access=registration }}</ref> He also stated that he originally wanted the title character to be a [[troll]] like the one in the children's story \"[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]\", but who inhabited the local [[sewer system]] rather than just the area beneath one bridge. He also wanted the story to interweave the stories of children and the adults they later become.\n\nThe novel won the [[British Fantasy Award]] in 1987, and received nominations for the [[Locus Award|Locus]] and [[World Fantasy Award]]s that same year.<ref name=\"WWE-1987\">{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1987| title = 1987 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed ''It'' as the best-selling hardcover fiction book in the United States in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monaghan|first=Charles|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1987/03/29/book-report/0c0e23d3-5bd0-4b82-8c3b-7cbf68d755a2/|title=BOOK REPORT|date=March 29, 1987|work=The Washington Post|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> ''It'' has been adapted into a [[It (miniseries)|1990 two-part miniseries]] directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]], a [[Woh|1998 television series]] directed by Glen Baretto & Ankush Mohla, and into a film duology directed by [[Andy Muschietti]]; ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' was released in September 2017 and ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' was released in September 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n===1957\u20131958===\nDuring a heavy rainstorm in [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], a six-year-old boy named [[Georgie Denbrough]] sails a paper boat his brother made for him along the rainy streets before it washed down into a storm drain. Peering into the drain, startled from seeing a pair of glowing yellow eyes, Georgie encounters an [[It (character)|eccentric clown]] who introduces himself as \"Mr. Bob Gray,\" a.k.a. \"Pennywise the Dancing Clown.\" Georgie declines a balloon but is enticed by Pennywise to reach into the drain and retrieve his boat, the clown ripping the child's arm off before leaving Georgie to die from [[Exsanguination|bleeding out]]. His body is later discovered and brought back to the Denbrough's house.\n\nThe following June, an overweight eleven-year-old boy named Ben Hanscom is harassed by a bully named Henry Bowers and his gang, escaping into the marshy wasteland known as [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20Barrens|the Barrens]] when attacked by his tormentors on the last day of school. There, Ben befriends an asthmatic hypochondriac named [[Eddie Kaspbrak]] and [[Bill Denbrough|\"Stuttering Bill\" Denbrough]], Georgie's elder brother who suffers from a stutter and rides on a rusty bike named \"Silver.\" The three boys later befriend fellow misfits [[Richie Tozier]], Stanley \"Stan\" Uris, and [[Beverly Marsh]], who eventually refer to themselves as \"The Losers Club.\" As the summer draws on, the Losers each encounter Pennywise in terrifying manifestations: a [[mummy]] on a frozen canal to Ben, a fountain of blood (that only children can see) from Beverly's sink, a diseased and rotting [[leper]] to Eddie, drowned corpses to Stan, and a frightening phantom of Georgie to Bill. The Losers eventually realize they are all being stalked by the same child-killing entity which killed Eddie Corcoran in the form of the [[Gill-man]].\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly unhinged and sadistic Bowers begins focusing his attention on his [[African-American]] neighbor Mike Hanlon and his father. Bowers kills Mike's dog and chases the terrified boy into the Barrens, where he joins the Losers in driving Bowers' gang off in a rock fight, a humiliated Bowers vowing revenge. Mike reveals his own encounter with Pennywise in the form of a flesh-eating bird while showing the Losers his historical scrapbook; the group realizes that \"It\" is a monster with a hold on the town. Following further encounters with It, the Losers construct a makeshift [[smoke hole]] that Richie and Mike use to hallucinate It's origins as an ancient alien entity that came to Earth in a meteor and feeds on children for a year before entering a 27-year-long hibernation.\n\nIn late July, after Eddie is hospitalized by Bowers and several of his friends, Beverly witnesses one of the bullies, Patrick Hockstetter, killed by It in the form of a mass of leeches while emptying a refrigerator he used to trap and kill injured animals. The Losers later discover a message from It written in Patrick's blood, warning them that It will kill them if they interfere. After Eddie is released from the hospital with a broken arm, Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar on the belief that silver will harm It. The story's narrative changes to Pennywise's perspective at that point, revealing It as a being from another reality known as the Macroverse that nourishes itself on fear from terrorizing children in the forms It assumes.\n\nThe Losers travel to the house on Neibolt Street, where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It, forcing Pennywise to flee into the sewers after Losers wound It with the silver [[slug]] while in the form of a [[werewolf]]. Deeming the Losers a threat, It provides Bowers with a [[switchblade]] while manipulating him into murdering his abusive father and recruiting his friends Victor \"Vic\" Criss and Reginald \"Belch\" Huggins into helping him follow the Losers into the sewers to kill them. But Vic and Belch are both killed by It in the form of [[Frankenstein's monster]] while a traumatized Bowers gets himself lost in the sewers. In the sewers, Bill performs the \"Ritual of Ch\u00fcd\" he learned to face It in the Macroverse where he meets the monster's antithesis Maturin, an ancient turtle that created the universe (which it vomited up following a stomach-ache), who explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills.\n\nBill enters It's mind through the ritual and sees the true form of It, a mass of destructive orange lights called the \"Deadlights\" before Bill defeats the monster with Maturin's help. After the battle, not knowing if they killed It or not, the Losers get lost in the sewers until they take part in an [[orgy]] to bring unity back to the group.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/top-5-sickest-stephen-king-sex-scenes-nsfw-6371394|title=Top 5 Sickest Stephen King Sex Scenes (NSFW)|last=Rouner|first=Jef|work=[[Houston Press]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The Losers then swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] to return to Derry should It resurface. Bowers, having lost his sanity by the time he washed out of the sewers into a nearby river, is institutionalized after being blamed for the child murders.\n\n=== 1984\u20131985 ===\nIn July 1984, at the annual Derry carnival, three youths brutally attack a young man named Adrian Mellon and throw him off a bridge. They are arrested and charged with murder when Mellon's mutilated corpse is found. One of the murderers claims that he saw an eccentric clown kill Mellon underneath the bridge. Adrian's boyfriend, Don Hagarty, the other victim in the attack, had also noticed the clown, but the prosecutors convince him not to mention it during the trial.\n\nWhen a string of violent child killings occurs in Derry once again, an adult Mike Hanlon, now the town's librarian and the only one of the Losers to remain in Derry, calls up the six former members of the Losers Club and reminds them of their childhood promise to return should the killings start again. Bill Denbrough is now a successful horror writer living in England with his actress wife, Audra. Beverly Marsh is a fashion designer in Chicago, who has married an abusive man named Tom Rogan, who is similar to her abusive father. Eddie Kaspbrak has moved to New York City, where he runs a limousine rental company and has married a hysterical codependent woman similar to his hypochondriac mother. Richie Tozier lives in Los Angeles and works as a disc jockey. Ben Hanscom is now thin and a successful but lonely architect, living in Nebraska. Stan Uris is a wealthy accountant residing in Atlanta, Georgia, and is married to a teacher named Patty Blum. Prior to Mike's phone calls, all of the Losers had completely forgotten each other and the trauma of their childhood, burying the horror of their encounters with It. However, all but Stan reluctantly agree to return to Derry. After Mike's phone call, Stan is in such fear at the thought of facing It again that he slits his wrists in the bathtub, writing \"IT\" on the wall in his own blood. Tom refuses to let Beverly go and tries to beat her, but she lashes out at him before fleeing, causing him serious injury. The five return to Derry with only the dimmest awareness of why they are doing so, remembering only absolute terror and their promise to return.\n\nThe Losers meet for lunch in a Chinese restaurant, where Mike reminds them that It awakens once roughly every 27 years for 12\u201316 months at a time, feeding on children before going into slumber again. The group decides to kill It once and for all. At Mike's suggestion, each person explores different parts of Derry to help restore their memories. While exploring, Eddie, Richie, Beverly, and Ben are faced with manifestations of It (Eddie as Belch Huggins and childhood friends in leper and zombified forms, Richie as a [[Paul Bunyan]] statue, Beverly as the witch from [[Hansel & Gretel]] in her childhood home, and Ben as [[Dracula]] in the Derry Library). Bill finds his childhood bicycle, \"Silver,\" and brings it to Mike's.\n\nThree other people are also converging on the town: Audra, who is worried about Bill; Tom, who plans to kill Beverly; and Henry Bowers, who has escaped from Juniper Hill Mental Asylum with help from It. Mike and Henry have a violent confrontation at the library. Mike is nearly killed, but Henry escapes, severely injured. Henry is driven to the hotel, where It instructs him to kill the rest of the Losers. Henry first attacks Eddie, breaking his arm once again, but in the fight, Henry is killed.\n\nIt appears to Tom and orders him to capture Audra. Tom brings Audra to It's lair. Upon seeing It's true form, Audra becomes [[catatonic]], and Tom drops dead in shock. Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, and Eddie learn that Mike is near death and realize they are being forced into another confrontation with It. They descend into the sewers and use their strength as a group to \"send energy\" to a hospitalized Mike, who fights off a nurse that is under the control of It. They reach It's lair and find It has taken the form of a giant spider. Bill and Richie enter It's mind through the Ritual of Ch\u00fcd, but they get lost in It. In order to distract It and bring Bill and Richie back, Eddie runs towards It and uses his aspirator to spray medicine in It's eye and down It's throat. Although he is successful, It bites off Eddie's arm, and Eddie dies due to blood loss. It runs away to tend to its injuries, but Bill, Richie, and Ben chase after and find that It has laid eggs. Ben stays behind to destroy the eggs, while Bill and Richie head toward their final confrontation with It. Bill fights his way inside It's body and locates It's heart and destroys it. The group meets up to head out of It's lair, and although they try to bring Audra and Eddie's bodies with them, they are forced to leave Eddie behind. They make it to the surface and realize that the scars on their hands from when they were children have disappeared, indicating that their ordeal is finally over.\n\nAt the same time, the worst storm in Maine's history sweeps through Derry, and the downtown area collapses. Mike concludes that Derry is finally dying. The Losers return home and gradually begin to forget about It, Derry, and each other. Mike's memory of the events of that summer also begins to fade, as well as any of the records he had written down previously, much to his relief, and he considers starting a new life elsewhere. Ben and Beverly leave together and become a couple, and Richie returns to California. Bill is the last to leave Derry. Before he goes, he takes Audra, still catatonic, for a ride on Silver, which awakens her from her catatonia, and they share a kiss.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand section|date=September 2019}}\nIn 1978, King and his family lived in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. One evening, King ventured alone to pick up his car from the repair shop and came across an old wooden bridge, \"humped and oddly quaint\". Walking along the bridge caused King to recall the story of \"[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]\", and the idea of transplanting the tale's scenario into a real-life context interested him. King was further inspired by a line by [[Marianne Moore]] concerning \"real toads in imaginary gardens\", which in his mind came out as \"real trolls in imaginary gardens\". King would return to the concept two years later and gradually accumulated ideas and thoughts, particularly the concept of weaving the narratives of children and the adults they become.

Supporting roles are played by [[Finn Wolfhard]] as Richie Tozier, [[Sophia Lillis]] as Beverly Marsh, [[Jack Dylan Grazer]] as Eddie Kaspbrak, [[Wyatt Oleff]] as Stanley Uris, [[Chosen Jacobs]] as Mike Hanlon, [[Jeremy Ray Taylor]] as Ben Hanscom, [[Owen Teague]] as Patrick Hockstetter, [[Nicholas Hamilton]] as Henry Bowers, Logan Thompson as Vic Criss and Jake Sim as Belch Huggins.\n\nThe second film, ''[[It Chapter Two]]'', adapted the \"adult\" section and updated the setting to the 2010s, specifically 2016. It starred [[James McAvoy]] (Bill), [[Bill Hader]] (Richie), [[Jessica Chastain]] (Beverly), [[James Ransone]] (Eddie), [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]] (Stan), [[Isaiah Mustafa]] (Mike), and [[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]] (Ben). Skarsg\u00e5rd reprised the role of Pennywise and the younger actors returned as well. Principal photography wrapped in 2018 and was released on September 6, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/it-chapter-two-cast-wrapped/|title=IT: Chapter Two Young Losers' Club Cast Has Wrapped Filming|date=2018-11-01|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Isfdb title|id=1695}}\n* [http://www.worldswithoutend.com/novel.asp?ID=765 It] at Worlds Without End\n* [http://illuminati8.blogspot.com/2011/05/it-by-stephen-king.html IT Review] at Illuminati Blog\n* [http://stephenkingsit.weebly.com A Chapter-By-Chapter Analysis] at It: An Annotated Look at Stephen King\n\n{{Stephen King's It}}\n{{Stephen King}}\n{{DarkTower}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:It (Novel)}}\n[[Category:1986 American novels]]\n[[Category:1980s horror novels]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1958]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1985]]\n[[Category:American horror novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Domestic violence in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fiction about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Fratricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Homophobia in fiction]]\n[[Category:It (novel)| ]]\n[[Category:Fiction about immortality]]\n[[Category:Novels about bullying]]\n[[Category:Novels about racism]]\n[[Category:Novels about sociopathy]]\n[[Category:Novels adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Novels by Stephen King]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Novels set in fictional populated places]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Maine]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Suicide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Trolls in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Demons in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Viking Press books]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.

The entire series was later re-narrated by [[George Carlin]] for the U.S. audiences.\n\nIt was produced by Clearwater Features Ltd. for [[Britt Allcroft]] (Thomas) Ltd.\n\n==Production==\n===Stories===\n[[Christopher Awdry]] was commissioned to write a new ''Railway Series'' book as source material for the second series. Three stories from ''[[List of Railway Series books#More About Thomas the Tank Engine|More About Thomas the Tank Engine]]'' provided additional roles for [[Bertie the Bus]], [[Terence the Tractor]], and [[Harold the Helicopter]]. The episodes \"Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree\" and \"Thomas and Trevor\" were both one-off stories written by Christopher. The following series would begin to use original stories by the production staff, with some of the remaining ''Railway Series'' stories deemed \"repetitive and too 'story-book' orientated\".<ref name=intsa>http://www.sodor-island.net/steveasquithinterview.html</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nEarly in production, a third episode based on ''[[List of Railway Series books#The Twin Engines|The Twin Engines]]'' was due to be filmed, based largely on the story \"[[List of Railway Series books#The Twin Engines|The Missing Coach]]\". The model crew had gone as far as filming scenes on the Tidmouth Station set with Thomas arriving at the station, before [[Britt Allcroft]] decided the episode had too little action and its storyline would be too difficult to understand by younger viewers.<ref name=mittoninterview>http://www.sodor-island.net/interviews.html</ref> Subsequently, the episode was cancelled and replaced with Thomas, Percy and the Coal. Several promotional stills from the filming of The Missing Coach have surfaced in various ''Thomas'' publications, while David Mitton was believed to be in possession of the original film footage.\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#1F5C8F|overall=|season=|title=|titleT=UK title (top)<hr />US title (bottom)|director=|aux2=|aux2T=Source|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Thomas & Friends (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=27\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Thomas, Percy & the Coal\"<hr />\"Double Trouble\n |DirectedBy= [[David Mitton]]\n |Aux2=''[[List of Railway Series books#More About Thomas the Tank Engine|More About Thomas the Tank Engine]]''<br />by [[Christopher Awdry]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1991|09|24|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary=Thomas brags to Percy and Toby about how \"blue is the only proper colour for a really useful engine\".

W. Awdry]].\n\nThis article lists and details episodes from the second series of the show, which was first broadcast in 1986.<ref name=\"TVARK\">{{cite web| url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/itvlondon/thames-cont1.html | title=TVARK ITV London Thames Television | accessdate=10 November 2014 | publisher = TVARK}}</ref> This series was initially narrated by [[Ringo Starr]] for the U.K. audiences, who re-narrated 17 episodes for the U.S. audiences on ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' in 1991. The entire series was later re-narrated by [[George Carlin]] for the U.S. audiences.\n\nIt was produced by Clearwater Features Ltd. for [[Britt Allcroft]] (Thomas) Ltd.\n\n==Production==\n===Stories===\n[[Christopher Awdry]] was commissioned to write a new ''Railway Series'' book as source material for the second series. Three stories from ''[[List of Railway Series books#More About Thomas the Tank Engine|More About Thomas the Tank Engine]]'' provided additional roles for [[Bertie the Bus]], [[Terence the Tractor]], and [[Harold the Helicopter]]. The episodes \"Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree\" and \"Thomas and Trevor\" were both one-off stories written by Christopher. The following series would begin to use original stories by the production staff, with some of the remaining ''Railway Series'' stories deemed \"repetitive and too 'story-book' orientated\".<ref name=intsa>http://www.sodor-island.net/steveasquithinterview.html</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nEarly in production, a third episode based on ''[[List of Railway Series books#The Twin Engines|The Twin Engines]]'' was due to be filmed, based largely on the story \"[[List of Railway Series books#The Twin Engines|The Missing Coach]]\". The model crew had gone as far as filming scenes on the Tidmouth Station set with Thomas arriving at the station, before [[Britt Allcroft]] decided the episode had too little action and its storyline would be too difficult to understand by younger viewers.<ref name=mittoninterview>http://www.sodor-island.net/interviews.html</ref> Subsequently, the episode was cancelled and replaced with Thomas, Percy and the Coal. Several promotional stills from the filming of The Missing Coach have surfaced in various ''Thomas'' publications, while David Mitton was believed to be in possession of the original film footage.\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#1F5C8F|overall=|season=|title=|titleT=UK title (top)<hr />US title (bottom)|director=|aux2=|aux2T=Source|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Thomas & Friends (series 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=27\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Thomas, Percy & the Coal\"<hr />\"Double Trouble\n |DirectedBy= [[David Mitton]]\n |Aux2=''[[List of Railway Series books#More About Thomas the Tank Engine|More About Thomas the Tank Engine]]''<br />by [[Christopher Awdry]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1986|09|24|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary=Thomas brags to Percy and Toby about how \"blue is the only proper colour for a really useful engine\".

The DWG EXTREME, DWG TRUECONVERT, and DWG TRUEVIEW trademark registration applications all received substantial resistance, with the USPTO examining attorney requiring Autodesk to disclaim exclusive use of DWG as a condition for their registration.\n\nIn a non-final action in May 2007, the USPTO examining attorney refused to register the two DWG marks, as they are \"merely descriptive\" of the use of DWG as a file format name. In September 2007, Autodesk responded, claiming that DWG has gained a \"secondary meaning,\" separate from its use as a generic file format name.<ref>[http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow?SRCH=Y&isSubmitted=true&details=&SELECT=US+Serial+No&TEXT=78852798# United States Patent & Trademark Office]</ref>\n\nAs of June 22, 2008, all of Autodesk's DWG-related trademark registration proceedings were suspended by the USPTO, pending disposition of trademark opposition and cancellation petitions Autodesk had filed against the Open Design Alliance and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes [[SolidWorks]] Corporation. The USPTO office actions notifying Autodesk of this noted that Autodesk was not the exclusive source of files with the format name DWG, and Autodesk does not control the use of DWG by others, either as a trademark or as a file format name, among other points.\n\nIn 2006, Autodesk filed an opposition with the USPTO to the trademark registration of DWGGATEWAY by [[SolidWorks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=dwg#page1.tif |url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91170857-OPP-1.pdf |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jkOm3Ntl?url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91170857-OPP-1.pdf |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |df= }}</ref>  Autodesk subsequently filed a petition for cancellation of SolidWorks' trademark registration for DWGEDITOR.<ref>[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-92046253-CAN-1.pdf Ttabvue.uspto.gov]</ref>  In both cases, Autodesk's basis was that they had \"been using the DWG name with its CAD software products since at least as early as 1983.\"  The opposition and cancellation actions were consolidated, and suspended pending disposition of Autodesk's [[US District Court]] suit against SolidWorks.<ref>[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91170857-OPP-32.pdf Ttabvue.uspto.gov]</ref>\n\nIn early 2007, Autodesk petitioned the USPTO to cancel the Open Design Alliance's \"OpenDWG\" trademarks, claiming that they had been abandoned.<ref>[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-92047002-CAN-1.pdf Ttabvue.uspto.gov]</ref> This cancellation action was suspended pending disposition of Autodesk's US District Court suit against SolidWorks.<ref>[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-92047002-CAN-53.pdf Ttabvue.uspto.gov]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Autodesk sued SolidWorks in US District Court, arguing that through its marketing efforts, the term \"DWG\" has lost its original generic meaning and taken on a secondary meaning referring specifically to Autodesk's proprietary drawing file format, and therefore any use of \"DWG\" in competitive products amounted to trademark infringement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Docket -> 3:08-cv-04397 (Autodesk v.
