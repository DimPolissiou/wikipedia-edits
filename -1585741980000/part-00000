Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

He was part of the era where silent films were being viewed and drawing on the medium of film became popular. He believed there were two dimensions to the theories of film and cinema: \"things themselves\", the facts that are presented in the world of the camera; and \"photographic imagination\", the way the camera shows the picture and how creative or imaginative it looks.<ref>\"Dal\u00ed & Film\"  Edt.

Dali also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dali frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dali said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dali's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dali's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDali was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dal\u00ed created a special \"costume for the year 2045\" with [[Christian Dior]].<ref name=designws />\n\nPhotographers with whom he collaborated include [[Man Ray]], [[Brassa\u00ef]], [[Cecil Beaton]], and [[Philippe Halsman]]. Halsman produced the ''Dal\u00ed Atomica'' series (1948)&nbsp;\u2013  inspired by Dali's painting ''Leda Atomica''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  which in one photograph depicts \"a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dal\u00ed himself floating in the air\".<ref name=designws />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dal\u00ed is buried]]\nArchitectural achievements include his [[Port Lligat]] house near [[Cadaqu\u00e9s]], as well as his [[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1952\u201363), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1927\u201333). Dali also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dali soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dali narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dali avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dali praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dali's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dali was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dali frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dali said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dali's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dali's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDali was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions than more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April.

The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians.

The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30.

This is just the [[time derivative]] of the previous equation ({{math|''m''}} is a constant).\n\n===Euler's second law===\n'''Euler's second law''' states that the rate of change of [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} (sometimes denoted {{math|'''H'''}}) about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the mass center of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force ([[torques]]) acting on that body {{math|'''M'''}} (also denoted {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} or {{math|'''\u0393'''}}) about that point:<ref name=\"McGillKing\"/><ref name=\"BookRags\"/><ref name=\"Rao\"/> \n:<math>\\mathbf M = {d\\mathbf L \\over dt}</math>.\n\nNote that the above formula holds only if both {{math|'''M'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass.  \nFor rigid bodies translating and rotating in only two dimensions, this can be expressed as:<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Introduction to Statics and Dynamics\n| last = Ruina\n| first = Andy\n|author2=[[Rudra Pratap]] \n| year = 2002\n| publisher = Oxford University Press\n| url = http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/Book/RuinaPratapNoProblems.pdf \n| format = PDF\n| accessdate = 2011-10-18\n| page = 771\n}}</ref>\n:<math>\\mathbf M = \\mathbf r_{\\rm cm} \\times \\mathbf a_{\\rm cm} m + I \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}</math>, \nwhere {{math|'''r'''<sub>cm</sub>}} is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are summed, {{math|'''\u03b1'''}} is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body about its center of mass, and {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body about its center of mass.\nSee also [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)]].\n\n==Explanation and derivation==\n\nThe distribution of internal forces in a deformable body are not necessarily equal throughout, i.e. the stresses vary from one point to the next.
