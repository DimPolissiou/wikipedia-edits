As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks.

The player character is a resident of Vault 76, a [[fallout shelter]] that was built in [[West Virginia]] to house America's best and brightest minds. The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n===''Wastelanders''===\nAbout one year after Vault 76 opened, in 2103, people have begun returning to Appalachia due to rumors of possible treasure in the area, possibly in one of the Vaults. Concerned for their well-being due to the threat of the Scorched and Scorchbeasts still being a problem after the Scorchbeast Queen was dealt with, the Vault 76 Overseer asks the residents of Vault 76 that have been rebuilding the Wasteland to assist the new residents of Appalachia, meeting, befriending, and helping them while trying to figure out the rumors of treasure that caused everyone to return. Many new locations have appeared, and some have been changed greatly because of the return of people to the Appalachian Wasteland. New creatures have also appeared, and the Scorched still pose a grave threat to all the newcomers to the region.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful\u2014albeit more expensive\u2014perks.

The player character is a resident of Vault 76, a [[fallout shelter]] that was built in [[West Virginia]] to house America's best and brightest minds. The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76 |title=Fallout 76: The History Of Vault 76 And What It Means For Fallout 76 |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=May 31, 2018 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611165612/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/fallout-76-the-history-of-vault-76-and-what-it-means-for-fallout-76# |archive-date=June 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nTwenty-five years after the [[World War III|Great War]], Vault 76 is opened up and its residents given the task of repopulating the Wasteland. Shortly after they emerge from the Vault, the player character is contacted by the Vault Overseer. She reveals that Vault 76 was given a secret mandate to secure an arsenal of nuclear weapons deployed throughout Appalachia in three still-functioning nuclear missile silos: Site Alpha, Site Bravo, and Site Charlie. The player character is directed to contact the First Responders, a faction of emergency services personnel who tried to aid the residents of Appalachia during the war; however, they discover that the First Responders evacuated after they came under attack from the Scorched. Further investigation reveals that the Scorched are ghouls infected by the breath of a Scorchbeast, a creature that was awoken after the Great War.\n\nAs the Scorched represent a threat to the Wasteland beyond Appalachia, the player character decides to secure a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy a Scorchbeast nest. In order to achieve this, they start searching the bunkers of survivalists calling themselves the Free States who were working on the means to detect the Scorched until the Scorched overran them. The player character is able to build a radar system that detects the viral signature of the Scorched, but its limited range makes it ineffective, even after helping boost the signal with gaining the friendship of Rose, a Miss Nanny robot trying to rebuild the local Raider gangs that lived in Appalachia before being scared off by the Scorched, and investigating the Scorchbeasts further through the research done by the local Brotherhood of Steel as they had tried to halt the spread of the Scorchbeasts from their main lair. They hack into a government network and draw the attention of the Enclave, the remnants of the United States government. The Enclave are led by MODUS, a centralized artificial intelligence system located in a secure nuclear fallout bunker beneath the Whitespring Resort. MODUS asks the player character to help connect them to a series of isolated computer networks across Appalachia, and in return offers to connect to the radar system to detect Scorched across the region.\n\nOnce MODUS is connected, they are able to identify the Scorchbeast nest at a location called Fissure Site Prime, close to where the Brotherhood of Steel had made their ultimate attempt to stop the Scorchbeast threat themselves and failed. The player character is directed to one of the three nuclear silos and they launch a missile at the nest. Venturing into the irradiated area, they uncover a laboratory at the center of the nest that was also found by the Brotherhood of Steel, implying that the Scorchbeasts were man-made. The explosion awakens a Scorchbeast Queen, and the player is forced to fight her. With the Queen defeated, the Scorchbeasts' hive mind is broken, and the threat to the wasteland beyond Appalachia is halted. The player character rejoins the other residents of Vault 76 in rebuilding the Wasteland.\n\n===''Wastelanders''===\nAbout one year after Vault 76 opened, in 2103, people have begun returning to Appalachia due to rumors of possible treasure in the area, possibly in one of the Vaults. Concerned for their well-being due to the threat of the Scorched and Scorchbeasts still being a problem after the Scorchbeast Queen was dealt with, the Vault 76 Overseer asks the residents of Vault 76 that have been rebuilding the Wasteland to assist the new residents of Appalachia, meeting, befriending, and helping them while trying to figure out the rumors of treasure that caused everyone to return. Many new locations have appeared, and some have been changed greatly because of the return of people to the Appalachian Wasteland. New creatures have also appeared, and the Scorched still pose a grave threat to all the newcomers to the region.\n\n== Development ==\n''Fallout 76'' uses a modified version of Bethesda's [[Creation Engine]] designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay.<ref name=\"Noclip\">{{cite web |author1=[[Noclip]] |title=The Making of Fallout 76 \u2013 Noclip Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 17, 2018 |date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617050330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs# |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Work on modifying the engine was carried out by [[Bethesda Game Studios Austin]].<ref name=\"Noclip\" /> The modified engine allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis.

The sugar most commonly found in glycosides is glucose. Among diverse group of glycosides three are most important. These are saponins, cardiac glycosides and cyanogenic glycosides.\n*'''Alkaloids:''' are a diverse group of nitrogen containing basic compounds. They are typically derived from plant sources and contain one or more nitrogen atoms. Chemically they are very heterogeneous. Based on chemical structures, they may be classified into two broad categories:\n** Non heterocyclic or atypical alkaloids, for example [[hordenine]] or [[N-Methyltyramine|''N''-methyltyramine]], [[colchicine]], and [[taxol]]\n** Heterocyclic or typical alkaloids, for example [[quinine]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]]\n\n== Microbial secondary metabolites ==\n\n=== Bacterial secondary metabolites ===\nBacterial production of secondary metabolites starts in the [[Stationary phase]] as a consequence of lack of nutrients or in response to environmental stress. Secondary metabolite synthesis in. bacteria is not essential for their growth, however, they allow them to better interact with their ecological niche. The main synthetic pathways of secondary metabolite production in bacteria are; b-lactam, oligosaccharide, shikimate, polyketide and non-ribosomal pathways.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gokulan|first=Kuppan|title=Metabolic Pathways: Production of Secondary Metabolites of Bacteria|date=2014-12-31|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288178246_Metabolic_Pathways_Production_of_Secondary_Metabolites_of_Bacteria|work=Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology|pages=561\u2013569|isbn=978-0-12-384733-1|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Khare|first2=Sangeeta|last3=Cerniglia|first3=C.}}</ref> Many bacterial secondary metabolites are toxic to [[mammal]]s. When secreted those poisonous compounds are known as [[exotoxin]]s whereas those found in the prokaryotic cell wall are [[endotoxins]].\n\nAn example of a bacterial secondary metabolite with positive and negative effect on humans is [[botulinum toxin]] synthesised by [[clostridium botulinum]].

Terpenes are only hydrocarbons and terpenoids are oxygenated hydrocarbons. The general molecular formula of terpenes are multiple of (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>n ,</sub> where 'n' is number of linked isoprene units. Hence, terpenes are also termed as isoprenoid compounds.

The sugar most commonly found in glycosides is glucose. Among diverse group of glycosides three are most important. These are saponins, cardiac glycosides and cyanogenic glycosides.\n*'''Alkaloids:''' are a diverse group of nitrogen containing basic compounds. They are typically derived from plant sources and contain one or more nitrogen atoms. Chemically they are very heterogeneous. Based on chemical structures, they may be classified into two broad categories:\n** Non heterocyclic or atypical alkaloids, for example [[hordenine]] or [[N-Methyltyramine|''N''-methyltyramine]], [[colchicine]], and [[taxol]]\n** Heterocyclic or typical alkaloids, for example [[quinine]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]]\n\n== Microbial secondary metabolites ==\n\n=== Bacterial secondary metabolites ===\nBacterial production of secondary metabolites starts in the [[Stationary phase]] as a consequence of lack of nutrients or in response to environmental stress.

A novel approach used by Evolva uses recombinant yeast S.cervisiae strains to produce secondary metabolitersnormally found in plants. The first successful chemical compound synthesised with evolva was vanillin, widely used in the food beverage industry as flavouring. \u00a0The process involves inserting the desired secondary metabolite gene into an artificial chromosome in the recombinant yeast leading to synthesis of vanillin. Currently Evolva produces a wide array of chemicals\u00a0 such as stevia, resveratrol or nootkatone.\n<br />\n== List of known secondary metabolites ==\n\n===Small \"small molecules\"===\n* '''[[Alkaloid]]s''' (usually a small, heavily derivated{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} amino acid):\n**  [[Hyoscyamine]], present in ''[[Datura stramonium]]''\n**  [[Atropine]], present in ''Atropa belladonna'', [[Deadly nightshade]]\n**  [[Cocaine]], present in ''Erythroxylum coca'' the [[Coca]] plant\n**  [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|Scopolamine]], present in the ''Solanaceae'' (nightshade) plant family\n**  [[Codeine]] and [[Morphine]], present in ''Papaver somniferum'', the [[opium poppy]]\n**  [[Tetrodotoxin]], a microbial product in [[Fugu]] and some [[salamanders]]\n**  [[Vincristine]] & [[Vinblastine]], [[mitotic inhibitor]]s found in the [[Rosy Periwinkle]]\n* '''[[Terpenoid]]s''' (come from [[terpene|semiterpene]] [[oligomerization]]):\n**  [[Azadirachtin]], ([[Neem]] tree)\n**  [[Artemisinin]], present in ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' Chinese wormwood\n**  [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], present in [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]\n**  '''[[Steroid]]s''' ([[Terpene]]s with a particular ring structure)\n***  '''[[Saponins]]''' (plant steroids, often glycosylated)\n* '''[[Flavonoid]]s''' (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word flavus meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites):\n**  [[isoflavonoids]] & [[neoflavonoids]], [[flavone]], [[flavanone]]s\n* '''[[Glycosides]]''' (heavily modified sugar molecules):\n**  [[Nojirimycin]]\n** '''[[Glucosinolate]]s'''\n* '''[[Natural phenol]]s''':\n** [[Resveratrol]]\n* '''[[Phenazine]]s''':\n** Pyocyanin\n**Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (and derivatives)\n* '''[[Biphenyl]]s and [[dibenzofuran]]s''' are [[phytoalexins]] of the ''[[Pyrinae]]''<ref name=\"Chizzali\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chizzali C, Beerhues L | title = Phytoalexins of the Pyrinae: Biphenyls and dibenzofurans | journal = Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 8 | pages = 613\u201320 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22563359 | pmc = 3343287 | doi = 10.3762/bjoc.8.68 }}</ref>\n\n===Big \"small molecules\", produced by large, modular, \"molecular factories\"===\n* '''[[Polyketide]]s''':\n** [[Erythromycin]]\n** [[Lovastatin]] and other statins\n** [[Discodermolide]]\n** [[Aflatoxin B1]]\n** [[Avermectin]]s\n** [[Nystatin]]\n** [[Rifamycin]]\n* '''[[Fatty acid]] synthase products''' :\n** [[Jawsamycin]] (FR-900848)\n** [[U-106305]]\n** [[phloroglucinol]]s\n* '''[[Nonribosomal peptide]]s''':\n** [[Vancomycin]]\n** [[Ramoplanin]]\n** [[Teicoplanin]]\n** [[Gramicidin]]\n** [[Bacitracin]]\n** [[Ciclosporin]]\n** [[Malacidin]]\n* '''Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides''':\n** [[Thiostrepton]]\n* '''Hybrids of the above three''':\n** [[Epothilone]]\n* [[Polyphenol]]s\n\n===Non-\"small molecules\": DNA, RNA, ribosome, or polysaccharide \"classical\" biopolymers===\n* '''[[ribosome|Ribosomal peptides]]''':\n** Microcin-J25\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Metabolism|Biology}}\n* [[Secondary metabolism]]\n* [[Hairy root culture]], a strategy used in plant tissue culture to produce commercially viable quantities of valuable secondary metabolites\n* [[Metabolite]]\n* [[Primary metabolite]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Secondary metabolites}}\n\n{{Secondary metabolites}}\n\n[[Category:Secondary metabolites| ]]\n", "name_user": "Jacobrusiecki", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite"}

The origin of ''mulato'' is uncertain, though it may derive from Portuguese ''mula'' (from the [[Latin]] ''m\u016blus''), meaning [[mule]], the [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |encyclopedia=Robert K.

Forbes suggests it originated in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[muwallad]]'', which means \"a person of mixed ancestry\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack D. Forbes|title=Africans and Native Americans: the language of race and the evolution of Red-Black peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06321-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&pg=PA145 145]}}</ref>\n''Muwallad'' literally means \"born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up\", with the implication of being born and raised among Arabs, but not of Arab blood. ''Muwallad'' is derived from the [[Semitic root|root word]] ''WaLaD'' (Arabic: \u0648\u0644\u062f direct Arabic [[transliteration]]: ''waw, lam, dal''), and [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial Arabic]] pronunciation can vary greatly. ''Walad'' means, \"descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one\".\n\nIn [[al-Andalus]], ''Muwallad'' referred to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]]. According to [[Lisan al-Arab]], one of the earliest Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term \"Muwalad\" has a meaning close to \"the adopted\". According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.\n\nIn English, printed usage of ''mulatto'' dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work ''Drake's Voyages'' first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined mulatto as \"one who is the offspring of a European and a Black\". This earliest usage regarded \"black\" and \"white\" as discrete \"species\", with the \"mulatto\" constituting a third separate \"species\".<ref>{{cite book|editor=David S.

These sources specify that ''mulato'' would have been derived directly from ''muwallad'' independently of the related word ''[[mulad\u00ed]],'' a term that was applied to [[Mozarab|Iberian Christians]] who had [[converted to Islam]] during the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|governance of Iberia]] in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the ''muwallad'' theory. It states, \"The term ''mulata'' is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in ''Documentacion medieval de la Corte de Justicia de Ganaderos de Zaragoza,'' whereas ''mulad\u00ed'' (from ''mullawad\u00ed'') does not appear until the 18th century, according to [[Joan Coromines|[Joan] Corominas]]\".{{#tag:ref|Corominas describes his doubts on the theory as follows: \"[''Mulato''] does not derive from the Arab ''muw\u00e1llad'', 'acculturated foreigner' and sometimes 'mulatto' (see {{'}}''Md\u00ed''{{'}}), as Egu\u00edlaz would have it, since this word was pronounced 'moo-EL-led' in the Arabic of Spain. In the 19th century, [[Reinhart Dozy]] (''Suppl\u00e9ment aux Dictionnaires Arabes'', Vol. II, Leyden, 1881, 841a) rejected this Arabic etymology, indicating the true one, supported by the Arabic ''nag\u00eel,'' 'mulatto', derived from ''nagl'', 'mule'.\"<ref>Corominas, Joan and Pascual, Jos\u00e9 A.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialists]] such as [[Edward Long]] and [[Josiah Nott]] began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollors points out that this etymology is anachronistic: \"The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word 'Mulatto.'\"<ref>Werner Sollors, ''Neither Black Nor White Yet Both'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 129.</ref>\n\n==Africa==\n{{seealso|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nOf [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]'s 193,413 inhabitants, the largest segment is classified as ''mesti\u00e7o,'' or mixed race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107943.html|title=S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> 71% of the population of [[Cape Verde]] is also classified as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107395.html|title=Cape Verde|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> The great majority of their current populations descend from unions between the Portuguese, who settled the islands from the 15th century onward, and black Africans they brought from the [[Africa|African mainland]] to work as slaves.

Under Apartheid law through the latter half of the 20th century, the government established seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing.

[[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]. Mexico 1763]]\nAfricans were transported by Portuguese slave traders to Spanish America starting in the early sixteenth century. Offspring of European Spaniards and African women resulted early on in mixed-race children, termed Mulattos.  In Spanish law, the status of the child followed that of the mother, so that despite having a Spanish parent, their offspring were enslaved. The label Mulatto was recorded in official colonial documentation, so that marriage registers, censuses, and court documents allow research on different aspects of mulattos\u2019 lives.  Although some legal documents simply label a person a Mulatto/a, other designations occurred.  In the sales of [[casta]] slaves in seventeenth-century Mexico City, official notaries recorded gradations of skin color in the transactions.  These included ''mulato blanco'' or ''mulata blanca'' (white mulatto), for light-skinned slave.  These were usually American-born (''criollo'') slaves.  Some said categorized persons i.e.m 'mulata blanca.' used their light skin to their advantage if they escpaped their unlawful and bruatal incarceration from their criminal slave owners, thus 'passing' as free persons on color.  ''Mulatos blancos'' often emphasized their Spanish parentage, and considered themselves and were considered separate from ''negros'' or ''pardos'' and ordinary mulattos. Darker mulatto slaves were often termed ''mulatos prietos'' or sometimes ''mulatos cochos''. <ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico''.

In a case that came before the [[Mexican Inquisition]], a woman publicly identified as a mulatta was described by a Spanish priest, Diego Xaimes Ricardo Villavicencio, as \"a white mulata with curly hair, because she is the daughter of a dark-skinned mulata and a Spaniard, and for her manner of dress she has flannel petticoats and a native blouse (''huipil''), sometimes silken, sometimes woolen. She wears shoes, and her natural and common language is not Spanish, but Chocho [an indigenous Mexican language], as she was brought up among Indians with her mother, from which she contracted the vice of drunkenness, to which she often succumbs, as Indians do, and from them she has also received the crime of [idolatry].\" Community members were interrogated as to their understanding of her racial standing.  Her mode of dress, very wavy hair and light skin confirmed for one witness that she was a mulatta. Ultimately though, her rootedness in the indigenous community persuaded the Inquisition that she was an ''India'', and therefore outside of their jurisdiction. <ref>Tav\u00e1rez, David. \"Legally Indian: Inquistorial Readings of Indigenous Identity in New Spain\u201d in ''Imperial Subjects: Race and Identity in Colonial Latin America''.

Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818\u201343), the son of a Frenchman and a former African slave, managed to unify a divided Haiti but excluded blacks from power. In 1847, a black military officer named Faustin Soulouque was made president, with the mulattoes supporting him; but, instead of proving a tool in the hands of the senators, he showed a strong will, and, although by his antecedents belonging to the mulatto party, he began to attach the blacks to his interest. The mulattoes retaliated by conspiring; but Soulouque began to decimate his enemies by confiscation, proscriptions, and executions. The black soldiers began a general massacre in Port-au-Prince, which ceased only after the French consul, Charles Reybaud, threatened to order the landing of marines from the men-of-war in the harbor.\n\n[[File:Pedro Santana cph.3a03390.jpg|thumb|175px|General Pedro Santana had a strong strain of negro and also of Indian blood.<ref name=Schoenrich>{{cite book |last1=Schoenrich |first1=Otto |title=Santo Domingo: a Country with a Future |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021106848 |date=1918 |publisher=Macmillan Company |location=New York}}</ref> In the Dominican Republic, the mulatto population absorbed remnants of the Ta\u00edno Amerindians historically present in that country.]]\nAmbitious to unite the two parts of the island, Soulouque invaded the Dominican territory in March, 1849, but was defeated in a decisive battle by Pedro Santana near Ocoa on 21 April and compelled to retreat. Haitian strategy was ridiculed by the American press:\n{{quote|[At the first encounter] ... a division of negro troops of Faustin ran, and their commander, Gen. Garat, was killed. The main body, eighteen thousand troops, under the Emperor, encountered four hundred Dominicans with a field piece, and notwithstanding the disparity of force, the latter charged and caused the Haytiens to flee in every direction ... Faustin came very near falling into the enemy's hands. They were once within a few feet of him, and he was only saved by Thirlonge and other officers of his staff, several of whom lost their lives.

Toward the close of 1855, he invaded the Dominican territory again at the head of an army of 30,000 men, but was again defeated by Santana, and barely escaped being captured. His treasure and crown fell into the hands of the enemy. Soulouque was ousted in a military coup led by mulatto General Fabre Geffrard in 1858\u201359. \n\nIn the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola, the mulattoes were an ever-growing majority group, and in essence they took over the entire Dominican Republic, with no organized black opposition.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\n{{Further|Demographics of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Miguel Enriquez.jpg|thumb|[[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (privateer)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]], a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[privateering|privateer]], is the only known mulatto knighted by the [[Monarchy of Spain]].

Starting with Virginia in 1662, colonies adopted the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'' in slave law, which said that children born in the colony were born into the status of their mother. Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were and whether they were baptized as Christians. Children born to white mothers were free, even if they were mixed-race. Children born to free mixed-race mothers were also free.\n\nPaul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color listed in the 1790\u20131810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African-American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, such working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Over the decades, many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others married increasingly into the white community.<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995\u20132005], Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co, 1995-2005</ref><ref>Dorothy Schneider, Carl J.

But many tribes had [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] systems and practices of absorbing other peoples into their cultures. Multiracial children born to Native American mothers were customarily raised in her family and specific tribal culture. Federally recognized Native American tribes have insisted that identity and membership is related to culture rather than race, and that individuals brought up within tribal culture are fully members, regardless of whether they also have some European or African ancestry. Many tribes have had mixed-race members who identify primarily as members of the tribes.\n\nIf the multiracial children were born to slave women (generally of at least partial African descent), they were classified under slave law as slaves. This was to the advantage of slaveowners, as Indian slavery had been abolished. If mixed-race children were born to Native American mothers, they should be considered free, but sometimes slaveholders kept them in slavery anyway. Multiracial children born to slave mothers were generally raised within the African-American community and considered \"black\".<ref name=afch/>\n\n===Influence===\nSome mixed-race people in the South became wealthy enough to become slave owners themselves. At times they held family members in slavery when there were many restrictions against freeing slaves. By the time of the Civil War, many mixed-race persons, or free people of color, who were accepted in the society supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. For example, [[William Ellison]] owned 60 slaves. Andrew Durnford of New Orleans, which had a large population of [[free people of color]], mostly of French descent and Catholic culture, was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves.

The origin of ''mulato'' is uncertain, though it may derive from Portuguese ''mula'' (from the [[Latin]] ''m\u016blus''), meaning [[mule]], the [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |encyclopedia=Robert K.

Forbes suggests it originated in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[muwallad]]'', which means \"a person of mixed ancestry\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack D. Forbes|title=Africans and Native Americans: the language of race and the evolution of Red-Black peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06321-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&pg=PA145 145]}}</ref>\n''Muwallad'' literally means \"born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up\", with the implication of being born and raised among Arabs, but not of Arab blood. ''Muwallad'' is derived from the [[Semitic root|root word]] ''WaLaD'' (Arabic: \u0648\u0644\u062f direct Arabic [[transliteration]]: ''waw, lam, dal''), and [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial Arabic]] pronunciation can vary greatly. ''Walad'' means, \"descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one\".\n\nIn [[al-Andalus]], ''Muwallad'' referred to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]]. According to [[Lisan al-Arab]], one of the earliest Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term \"Muwalad\" has a meaning close to \"the adopted\". According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.\n\nIn English, printed usage of ''mulatto'' dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work ''Drake's Voyages'' first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined mulatto as \"one who is the offspring of a European and a Black\". This earliest usage regarded \"black\" and \"white\" as discrete \"species\", with the \"mulatto\" constituting a third separate \"species\".<ref>{{cite book|editor=David S.

These sources specify that ''mulato'' would have been derived directly from ''muwallad'' independently of the related word ''[[mulad\u00ed]],'' a term that was applied to [[Mozarab|Iberian Christians]] who had [[converted to Islam]] during the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|governance of Iberia]] in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the ''muwallad'' theory. It states, \"The term ''mulata'' is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in ''Documentacion medieval de la Corte de Justicia de Ganaderos de Zaragoza,'' whereas ''mulad\u00ed'' (from ''mullawad\u00ed'') does not appear until the 18th century, according to [[Joan Coromines|[Joan] Corominas]]\".{{#tag:ref|Corominas describes his doubts on the theory as follows: \"[''Mulato''] does not derive from the Arab ''muw\u00e1llad'', 'acculturated foreigner' and sometimes 'mulatto' (see {{'}}''Md\u00ed''{{'}}), as Egu\u00edlaz would have it, since this word was pronounced 'moo-EL-led' in the Arabic of Spain. In the 19th century, [[Reinhart Dozy]] (''Suppl\u00e9ment aux Dictionnaires Arabes'', Vol. II, Leyden, 1881, 841a) rejected this Arabic etymology, indicating the true one, supported by the Arabic ''nag\u00eel,'' 'mulatto', derived from ''nagl'', 'mule'.\"<ref>Corominas, Joan and Pascual, Jos\u00e9 A.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialists]] such as [[Edward Long]] and [[Josiah Nott]] began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollors points out that this etymology is anachronistic: \"The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word 'Mulatto.'\"<ref>Werner Sollors, ''Neither Black Nor White Yet Both'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 129.</ref>\n\n==Africa==\n{{seealso|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nOf [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]'s 193,413 inhabitants, the largest segment is classified as ''mesti\u00e7o,'' or mixed race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107943.html|title=S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> 71% of the population of [[Cape Verde]] is also classified as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107395.html|title=Cape Verde|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> The great majority of their current populations descend from unions between the Portuguese, who settled the islands from the 15th century onward, and black Africans they brought from the [[Africa|African mainland]] to work as slaves.

The persistence of some authors in using this term, anachronistically, reflects the old-school essentialist views of race as a ''de facto'' biological phenomenon, and the 'mixing' of race as legitimate grounds for the creation of a 'new race'.

Under Apartheid law through the latter half of the 20th century, the government established seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing.

The use of the term 'Coloured' has changed over the course of history. For instance, in the first census after the South African war (1912), Indians were counted as 'Coloured'.

The label Mulatto was recorded in official colonial documentation, so that marriage registers, censuses, and court documents allow research on different aspects of mulattos\u2019 lives.  Although some legal documents simply label a person a Mulatto/a, other designations occurred.  In the sales of [[casta]] slaves in seventeenth-century Mexico City, official notaries recorded gradations of skin color in the transactions.  These included ''mulato blanco'' or ''mulata blanca'' (white mulatto), for light-skinned slave.  These were usually American-born (''criollo'') slaves.  Some said categorized persons i.e.m 'mulata blanca.' used their light skin to their advantage if they escpaped their unlawful and bruatal incarceration from their criminal slave owners, thus 'passing' as free persons on color.  ''Mulatos blancos'' often emphasized their Spanish parentage, and considered themselves and were considered separate from ''negros'' or ''pardos'' and ordinary mulattos. Darker mulatto slaves were often termed ''mulatos prietos'' or sometimes ''mulatos cochos''. <ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico''.

In a case that came before the [[Mexican Inquisition]], a woman publicly identified as a mulatta was described by a Spanish priest, Diego Xaimes Ricardo Villavicencio, as \"a white mulata with curly hair, because she is the daughter of a dark-skinned mulata and a Spaniard, and for her manner of dress she has flannel petticoats and a native blouse (''huipil''), sometimes silken, sometimes woolen. She wears shoes, and her natural and common language is not Spanish, but Chocho [an indigenous Mexican language], as she was brought up among Indians with her mother, from which she contracted the vice of drunkenness, to which she often succumbs, as Indians do, and from them she has also received the crime of [idolatry].\" Community members were interrogated as to their understanding of her racial standing.  Her mode of dress, very wavy hair and light skin confirmed for one witness that she was a mulatta. Ultimately though, her rootedness in the indigenous community persuaded the Inquisition that she was an ''India'', and therefore outside of their jurisdiction. <ref>Tav\u00e1rez, David. \"Legally Indian: Inquistorial Readings of Indigenous Identity in New Spain\u201d in ''Imperial Subjects: Race and Identity in Colonial Latin America''.

Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818\u201343), the son of a Frenchman and a former African slave, managed to unify a divided Haiti but excluded blacks from power. In 1847, a black military officer named Faustin Soulouque was made president, with the mulattoes supporting him; but, instead of proving a tool in the hands of the senators, he showed a strong will, and, although by his antecedents belonging to the mulatto party, he began to attach the blacks to his interest. The mulattoes retaliated by conspiring; but Soulouque began to decimate his enemies by confiscation, proscriptions, and executions. The black soldiers began a general massacre in Port-au-Prince, which ceased only after the French consul, Charles Reybaud, threatened to order the landing of marines from the men-of-war in the harbor.\n\n[[File:Pedro Santana cph.3a03390.jpg|thumb|175px|General Pedro Santana had a strong strain of negro and also of Indian blood.<ref name=Schoenrich>{{cite book |last1=Schoenrich |first1=Otto |title=Santo Domingo: a Country with a Future |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021106848 |date=1918 |publisher=Macmillan Company |location=New York}}</ref> In the Dominican Republic, the mulatto population absorbed remnants of the Ta\u00edno Amerindians historically present in that country.]]\nAmbitious to unite the two parts of the island, Soulouque invaded the Dominican territory in March, 1849, but was defeated in a decisive battle by Pedro Santana near Ocoa on 21 April and compelled to retreat.

Toward the close of 1855, he invaded the Dominican territory again at the head of an army of 30,000 men, but was again defeated by Santana, and barely escaped being captured. His treasure and crown fell into the hands of the enemy. Soulouque was ousted in a military coup led by mulatto General Fabre Geffrard in 1858\u201359. \n\nIn the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola, the mulattoes were an ever-growing majority group, and in essence they took over the entire Dominican Republic, with no organized black opposition.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\n{{Further|Demographics of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Miguel Enriquez.jpg|thumb|[[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (privateer)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]], a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[privateering|privateer]], is the only known mulatto knighted by the [[Monarchy of Spain]].

Starting with Virginia in 1662, colonies adopted the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'' in slave law, which said that children born in the colony were born into the status of their mother. Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were and whether they were baptized as Christians. Children born to white mothers were free, even if they were mixed-race. Children born to free mixed-race mothers were also free.\n\nPaul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color listed in the 1790\u20131810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African-American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, such working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Over the decades, many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others married increasingly into the white community.<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995\u20132005], Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co, 1995-2005</ref><ref>Dorothy Schneider, Carl J.

However, slave girls often courted a sexual relationship with the master, or another male in the family, as a way of gaining distinction among the slaves, avoiding field work, and obtaining special jobs and other favored treatment for their mixed children (Reuter, 1970:129). Sexual contacts between the races also included prostitution, adventure, [[concubinage]], and sometimes love. In rare instances, where free blacks were concerned, there was marriage (Bennett, 1962:243\u201368).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d9FC-gcWaAC&pg Floyd James Davis, ''Who Is Black?: One Nation's Definition''], pp. 38\u201339</ref>}}\n\nHistorically in the [[American South]], the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[African American]] ancestry.<ref name=afch>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpusu6xQq6QC&pg=PA33&dq=afro+cherokee+smallpox#v=onepage&q=afro%20cherokee%20smallpox&f=false |title=Ties that Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom |author=Miles, Tiya |accessdate=2009-10-27 |year=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25002-4}}</ref> For example, a 1705 [[Virginia]] statute reads as follows: \n<blockquote>\"And for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act, or any other act, who shall be accounted a mulatto, Be it enacted and declared, and it is hereby enacted and declared, That the child of an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] and the child, grand child, or great grand child, of a [[negro]] shall be deemed, accounted, held and taken to be a mulatto.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=General Assembly of Virginia|authorlink1=Virginia|editor1-last=Hening|editor1-first=William Waller|title=Statutes at Large|date=1823|location=Philadelphia|page=252|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i3OAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA252|accessdate=30 September 2014|chapter=4th Anne Ch.

The societies did not always observe this distinction.\n\nCertain Native American tribes of the Inocoplo family in [[Texas]] referred to themselves as \"mulatto\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmm38 |title=Mulato Indians |work=The Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2013-01-07}}.</ref> At one time, Florida's laws declared that a person from any number of mixed ancestries would be legally defined as a mulatto, including White/Hispanic, Black/Native American, and just about any other mix as well.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nvkAIulFIC&pg=PA19 |page=19 |title=The Indians of North Florida: From Carolina to Florida, the Story of the Survival of a Distinct American Indian Community |author1=Sewell, Christopher Scott |author2=Hill, S.

But many tribes had [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] systems and practices of absorbing other peoples into their cultures. Multiracial children born to Native American mothers were customarily raised in her family and specific tribal culture. Federally recognized Native American tribes have insisted that identity and membership is related to culture rather than race, and that individuals brought up within tribal culture are fully members, regardless of whether they also have some European or African ancestry. Many tribes have had mixed-race members who identify primarily as members of the tribes.\n\nIf the multiracial children were born to slave women (generally of at least partial African descent), they were classified under slave law as slaves. This was to the advantage of slaveowners, as Indian slavery had been abolished. If mixed-race children were born to Native American mothers, they should be considered free, but sometimes slaveholders kept them in slavery anyway. Multiracial children born to slave mothers were generally raised within the African-American community and considered \"black\".<ref name=afch/>\n\n===Influence===\nSome mixed-race people in the South became wealthy enough to become slave owners themselves. At times they held family members in slavery when there were many restrictions against freeing slaves. By the time of the Civil War, many mixed-race persons, or free people of color, who were accepted in the society supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. For example, [[William Ellison]] owned 60 slaves. Andrew Durnford of New Orleans, which had a large population of [[free people of color]], mostly of French descent and Catholic culture, was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves. In Louisiana [[free people of color]] constituted a third class between white colonists and the mass of slaves.<ref>Joseph Conlin (2011).

Frederick Douglass escaped slavery and became nationally known as an abolitionist in the North. \n\nIn other examples, [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] and [[Thomy Lafon]] of New Orleans used their fortunes to support the abolitionist cause.
