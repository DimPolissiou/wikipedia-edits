{"title_page": "Schwarzschild geodesics", "text_new": "In [[general relativity]], '''Schwarzschild geodesics''' describe the motion of particles of infinitesimal mass in the [[gravitational field]] of a central fixed mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math>. Schwarzschild geodesics have been pivotal in the [[tests of general relativity|validation]] of Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. For example, they provide accurate predictions of the anomalous precession of the planets in the Solar System, and of the deflection of light by gravity.\n\nSchwarzschild geodesics pertain only to the motion of particles of infinitesimal mass <math display=\"inline\">m</math>, i.e., particles that do not themselves contribute to the gravitational field. However, they are highly accurate provided that <math display=\"inline\">m</math> is many-fold smaller than the central mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math>, e.g., for planets orbiting their sun.  Schwarzschild geodesics are also a good approximation to the relative motion of two bodies of arbitrary mass, provided that the Schwarzschild mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math> is set equal to the sum of the two individual masses <math display=\"inline\">m_1</math> and <math display=\"inline\">m_2</math>. This is important in predicting the motion of [[binary star]]s in general relativity.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is named in honour of its discoverer [[Karl Schwarzschild]], who found the solution in 1915, only about a month after the publication of Einstein's theory of general relativity. It was the first exact solution of the Einstein field equations other than the trivial [[Minkowski spacetime|flat space solution]].\n\n==Schwarzschild metric==\n\n{{See also|Schwarzschild metric|Deriving the Schwarzschild solution}}\n\nAn exact solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which corresponds to the external gravitational field of an uncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math>.  The Schwarzschild solution can be written as<ref name=Schwarzschild_metric>Landau and Lifshitz, pp. 299&ndash;301.</ref>\n\n:<math>\nc^2 {d \\tau}^{2} = \n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} dt^{2} - \\frac{dr^{2}}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} - r^{2} d\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta \\, d\\varphi^{2}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\tau</math> is the proper time (time measured by a clock moving with the particle) in seconds,\n: <math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]] in meters per second,\n: <math>t</math> is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity) in seconds,\n: <math>r</math> is the radial coordinate (circumference of a circle centered on the star divided by <math>2\\pi</math>) in meters,\n: <math>\\theta</math> is the [[colatitude]] (angle from North) in radians,\n: <math>\\varphi</math> is the [[longitude]] in radians, and\n: <math>r_s</math> is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] (in meters) of the massive body, which is related to its mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math> by\n:: <math>\nr_{\\rm s} = \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}},\n</math>\n: where <math display=\"inline\">G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity is recovered in the limit as the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{r_s}{r}</math> goes to zero.  In that limit, the metric returns to that defined by [[special relativity]].\n\nIn practice, this ratio is almost always extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math> of the Earth is roughly 9&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch); at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion.  The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is much larger, roughly 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{r_s}{r}</math> is roughly 4 parts in a million.  A [[white dwarf]] star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface is roughly 250 parts in a million.  The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s (where the ratio is roughly 50%) and [[black hole]]s.\n\n==Orbits of test particles==\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|250px|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime; note the [[apsidal precession]] on the right.]]\nWe may simplify the problem by using symmetry to eliminate one variable from consideration.  Since the Schwarzschild metric is symmetrical about <math display=\"inline\">\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>, any geodesic that begins moving in that plane will remain in that plane indefinitely (the plane is [[totally geodesic]]).  Therefore, we orient the coordinate system so that the orbit of the particle lies in that plane, and fix the <math display=\"inline\">\\theta</math> coordinate to be <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> so that the metric (of this plane) simplifies to\n\n:<math>\nc^2 d \\tau^{2} = \n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} dt^{2} - \\frac{dr^{2}}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} - r^{2} d\\varphi^{2}.\n</math>\n\nTwo [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] can then be identified (cf. the derivation given [[#Lagrangian approach|below]]). One is the total energy <math display=\"inline\">E</math>:\n:<math>\n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} = \\frac{E}{m c^{2}}.\n</math>\n\nand the other is the [[Specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]]:\n:<math>\nh = \\frac{L}{\\mu} = r^{2} \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\tau},\n</math>\n\nwhere L is the total angular momentum of the two bodies, and <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> is the [[reduced mass]]. When <math display=\"inline\">M \\gg m</math>, the reduced mass is approximately equal to <math display=\"inline\">m</math>. Sometimes it is assumed that <math display=\"inline\">m = \\mu</math>. In the case of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] this simplification introduces an error more than twice as large as the relativistic effect. When discussing geodesics, <math display=\"inline\">m</math> can be considered fictitious, and what matters is the constants <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E}{m}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h</math>. In order to cover all possible geodesics, we need to consider cases in which <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E}{m}</math> is infinite (giving trajectories of [[photon]]s) or [[imaginary number|imaginary]] (for [[tachyonic]] geodesics). For the photonic case, we also need to specify a number corresponding to the ratio of the two constants, namely <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{mh}{E}</math>, which may be zero or a non-zero real number.\n\nSubstituting these constants into the definition of the Schwarzschild metric\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} \\left( \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} - \n\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} \\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} - \nr^{2} \\left( \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2},\n</math>\n\nyields an equation of motion for the radius as a function of the proper time <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\right).\n</math>\n\nThe formal solution to this is\n\n:<math>\n\\tau = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\right)}}.\n</math>\n\nNote that the square root will be imaginary for tachyonic geodesics.\n\nUsing the relation higher up between <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dt}{d\\tau}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">E</math>, we can also write\n\n:<math>\nt = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm c\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right)\\sqrt{1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right)\\frac{m^2 c^2}{E^2}}}.\n</math>\n\nSince [[asymptotically]] the integrand is inversely proportional to <math display=\"inline\">r - r_{\\rm s}</math>, this shows that in the <math display=\"inline\">r, \\theta, \\varphi, t</math> frame of reference if <math display=\"inline\">r</math> approaches <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math> it does so exponentially without ever reaching it. However, as a function of <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math>, <math display=\"inline\">r</math> does reach <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>.\n\nThe above solutions are valid while the integrand is finite, but a total solution may involve two or an infinity of pieces, each described by the integral but with alternating signs for the square root.\n\nWhen <math display=\"inline\">E = mc^2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h = 0</math>, we can solve for <math display=\"inline\">t</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math> explicitly:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     t &= \\text{constant} \\pm \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}} + \\ln\\frac{\\left|\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}}} - 1\\right|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}}} + 1}\\right) \\\\\n  \\tau &= \\text{constant}\\pm\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand for photonic geodesics (<math display=\"inline\">m = 0</math>) with zero angular momentum\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     t &= \\text{constant} \\pm \\frac{1}{c}\\left(r + r_{\\rm s}\\ln\\left|\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}} - 1\\right|\\right) \\\\\n  \\tau &= \\text{constant}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(Although the proper time is trivial in the photonic case, one can define an affine parameter <math display=\"inline\">\\lambda</math>, and then the solution to the geodesic equation is <math display=\"inline\">r = c_1\\lambda + c_2</math>.) \n\nAnother solvable case is that in which <math display=\"inline\">E = 0</math> and <math display=\"inline\">t</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> are constant. In the volume where <math display=\"inline\">r < r_s</math> this gives for the proper time\n\n:<math>\\tau=\\text{constant}\\pm\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\arcsin\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\left(1-\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nThis is close to solutions with <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E^2}{m^2}</math> small and positive. Outside of ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'' the <math display=\"inline\">E = 0</math> solution is tachyonic and the \"proper time\" is space-like:\n\n:<math>\\tau=\\text{constant}\\pm i\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}-1}\\right)+\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}-1\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nThis is close to other tachyonic solutions with <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E^2}{m^2}</math> small and negative. The constant <math display=\"inline\">t</math> tachyonic geodesic outside ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'' is not continued by a constant <math display=\"inline\">t</math> geodesic inside ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'', but rather continues into a \"parallel exterior region\" (see [[Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates]]). Other tachyonic solutions can enter a black hole and re-exit into the parallel exterior region. The constant ''t'' solution inside the event horizon (''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'') is continued by a constant ''t'' solution in a [[white hole]].\n\nWhen the angular momentum is not zero we can replace the dependence on proper time by a dependence on the angle <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> using the definition of <math display=\"inline\">h</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} =\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{ r^{2}}{h} \\right)^{2},\n</math>\n\nwhich yields the equation for the orbit\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{r^{4}}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r^{4}}{a^{2}} + r^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere, for brevity, two length-scales, <math display=\"inline\">a</math> and  <math display=\"inline\">b</math>, have been defined by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a &= \\frac{h}{c}, \\\\\n  b &= \\frac{cL}{E} = \\frac{hmc}E.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote that in the tachyonic case, <math display=\"inline\">a</math> will be imaginary and <math display=\"inline\">b</math> real or infinite.\n\nThe same equation can also be derived using a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian approach]]<ref>Whittaker 1937.</ref> or the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]]<ref name=\"ll_1975_HJ\" >Landau and Lifshitz (1975), pp. 306&ndash;309.</ref> (see [[#Alternative derivations of orbit equation|below]]). The solution of the orbit equation is\n\n:<math>\n\\varphi = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm r^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{a^{2}} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\right)}}.\n</math>\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass elliptic function]] <math display=\"inline\">\\wp</math>.<ref>Gibbons and Vyska, \"The Application of Weierstrass elliptic functions to\nSchwarzschild Null Geodesics,\" https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6508</ref>\n\n==Local and delayed velocities==\n\nUnlike in classical mechanics, in Schwarzschild coordinates <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{{\\rm d}r}{{\\rm d}\\tau}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">r\\ \\frac{{\\rm d}\\varphi}{{\\rm d}\\tau}</math> are not the radial <math display=\"inline\">v_{\\parallel}</math> and transverse <math display=\"inline\">v_{\\perp}</math> components of the local [[velocity]] <math display=\"inline\">v</math> (relative to a stationary observer), instead they give the components for the [[proper velocity|celerity]] which are related to <math display=\"inline\">v</math> by\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm d}r}{{\\rm d}\\tau} = v_\\parallel \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}\\ \\gamma</math>\n\nfor the radial and\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm d}\\varphi}{{\\rm d}\\tau} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r} \\ \\gamma</math>\n\nfor the transverse component of motion, with <math display=\"inline\">v^2 = v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2</math>.

For further information, please see the article on the [[classical central-force problem]].</ref> if it is expressed in terms of the inverse radius <math display=\"inline\">u = \\frac{1}{r}</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{du}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - u r_{\\rm s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{a^{2}} + u^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation is a [[cubic function|cubic polynomial]], which has three [[root of a function|roots]], denoted here as ''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>, and ''u''<sub>3</sub>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{du}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = r_{\\rm s}  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right) \n</math>\n\nThe sum of the three roots equals the coefficient of the ''u''<sup>2</sup> term\n\n:<math>\nu_{1} + u_{2} + u_{3} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\rm s}}\n</math>\n\nA cubic polynomial with real coefficients can either have three real roots, or one real root and two [[complex conjugate]] roots. If all three roots are [[real number]]s, the roots are labeled so that  ''u''<sub>1</sub> &lt; ''u''<sub>2</sub> &lt; ''u''<sub>3</sub>.  If instead there is only one real root, then that is denoted as ''u''<sub>3</sub>; the complex conjugate roots are labeled ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub>.  Using [[Descartes' rule of signs]], there can be at most one negative root; ''u''<sub>1</sub> is negative if and only if ''b'' &lt; ''a''.  As discussed below, the roots are useful in determining the types of possible orbits.\n\nGiven this labeling of the roots, the solution of the fundamental orbital equation is\n\n:<math>\nu = u_{1} + \\left( u_{2} - u_{1} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{sn}^{2}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi \\sqrt{r_{\\rm s} \\left( u_{3} - u_{1} \\right)} + \\delta \\right)\n</math>\n \nwhere sn represents the ''sinus amplitudinus function'' (one of the [[Jacobi elliptic function]]s) and \u03b4 is a constant of integration reflecting the initial position. The [[elliptic modulus]] ''k'' of this elliptic function is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{u_{2} - u_{1}}{u_{3} - u_{1}}}\n</math>\n\n===Newtonian limit===\n\nTo recover the Newtonian solution for the planetary orbits, one takes the limit as the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>s</sub> goes to zero.  In this case, the third root ''u''<sub>3</sub> becomes roughly <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{1}{r_\\text{s}}</math>, and much larger than ''u''<sub>1</sub> or ''u''<sub>2</sub>.  Therefore, the modulus ''k'' tends to zero; in that limit, sn becomes the [[trigonometric functions|trigonometric sine function]]\n\n:<math>\nu = u_{1} + \\left( u_{2} - u_{1} \\right) \\, \\sin^{2}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi + \\delta \\right)\n</math>\n \nConsistent with Newton's solutions for planetary motions, this formula describes a focal conic of eccentricity ''e''\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{u_{2} - u_{1}}{u_{2} + u_{1}}\n</math>\n\nIf ''u''<sub>1</sub> is a positive real number, then the orbit is an [[ellipse]] where ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub> represent the distances of furthest and closest approach, respectively. If ''u''<sub>1</sub> is zero or a negative real number, the orbit is a [[parabola]] or a [[hyperbola]], respectively. In these latter two cases, ''u''<sub>2</sub> represents the distance of closest approach; since the orbit goes to infinity (''u'' = 0), there is no distance of furthest approach.\n\n===Roots and overview of possible orbits===\n\nA root represents a point of the orbit where the derivative vanishes, i.e., where <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{du}{d\\phi} = 0</math>.  At such a turning point, ''u'' reaches a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection point, depending on the value of the second derivative, which is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\varphi^{2}} = \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{2} \\left[  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right)   +  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right)   +  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\right]\n</math>\n\nIf all three roots are distinct real numbers, the second derivative is positive, negative, and positive at  ''u''<sub>1</sub>,''u''<sub>2</sub>, and ''u''<sub>3</sub>, respectively.  It follows that a graph of ''u'' versus \u03c6 may either oscillate between ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub>, or it may move away from ''u''<sub>3</sub> towards infinity (which corresponds to ''r'' going to zero). If ''u''<sub>1</sub> is negative, only part of an \"oscillation\" will actually occur. This corresponds to the particle coming from infinity, getting near the central mass, and then moving away again toward infinity, like the hyperbolic trajectory in the classical solution.\n\nIf the particle has just the right amount of energy for its angular momentum, ''u''<sub>2</sub> and ''u''<sub>3</sub> will merge. There are three solutions in this case. The orbit may spiral in to <math display=\"inline\">r = \\frac{1}{u_2} = \\frac{1}{u_3}</math>, approaching that radius as (asymptotically) a decreasing exponential in \u03c6, \u03c4, or ''t''. Or one can have a circular orbit at that radius. Or one can have an orbit that spirals down from that radius to the central point. The radius in question is called the inner radius and is between <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{3}{2}</math> and 3 times ''r<sub>s</sub>''. A circular orbit also results when ''u''<sub>2</sub> is equal to ''u''<sub>1</sub>, and this is called the outer radius. These different types of orbits are discussed below.\n\nIf the particle comes at the central mass with sufficient energy and sufficiently low angular momentum then only ''u''<sub>1</sub> will be real. This corresponds to the particle falling into a black hole.

The Christoffel symbol depends only on the [[metric tensor]] <math display=\"inline\">g_{\\mu\\nu}</math>, or rather on how it changes with position. The variable <math display=\"inline\">q</math> is a constant multiple of the [[proper time]] <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math> for timelike orbits (which are traveled by massive particles), and is usually taken to be equal to it.  For lightlike (or null) orbits (which are traveled by massless particles such as the [[photon]]), the proper time is zero and, strictly speaking, cannot be used as the variable <math display=\"inline\">q</math>. Nevertheless, lightlike orbits can be derived as the [[ultrarelativistic limit]] of timelike orbits, that is, the limit as the particle mass ''m'' goes to zero while holding its total [[energy]] fixed.\n\nTherefore, to solve for the motion of a particle, the most straightforward way is to solve the geodesic equation, an approach adopted by Einstein<ref>Einstein, pp. 95&ndash;96.</ref> and others.<ref>Weinberg, pp. 185&ndash;188; Wald, pp. 138&ndash;139.</ref>  The Schwarzschild metric may be written as\n\n:<math>\nc^{2}d\\tau^{2} = w(r) c^2 dt^{2} - v(r) dr^{2} - r^{2} d\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta d\\phi^{2}\n\\,</math>\n\nwhere the two functions <math display=\"inline\">w(r) = 1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}</math>and its reciprocal <math display=\"inline\">v(r)= \\frac{1}{w(r)}</math>are defined for brevity.

The basic idea is that, due to gravitational slowing of time, parts of a wave-front closer to a gravitating mass move more slowly than those further away, thus bending the direction of the wave-front's propagation.\n\nUsing general covariance, the [[Hamilton&ndash;Jacobi equation]] for a single particle of unit mass can be expressed in arbitrary coordinates as\n\n:<math>\ng^{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x^{\\mu}} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x^{\\nu}} = c^{2}.\n</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to the Hamiltonian formulation above, with the partial derivatives of the action taking the place of the generalized momenta.

Schwarzschild geodesics have been pivotal in the [[tests of general relativity|validation]] of Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. For example, they provide accurate predictions of the anomalous precession of the planets in the Solar System, and of the deflection of light by gravity.\n\nSchwarzschild geodesics pertain only to the motion of particles of infinitesimal mass <math display=\"inline\">m</math>, i.e., particles that do not themselves contribute to the gravitational field. However, they are highly accurate provided that <math display=\"inline\">m</math> is many-fold smaller than the central mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math>, e.g., for planets orbiting their sun.  Schwarzschild geodesics are also a good approximation to the relative motion of two bodies of arbitrary mass, provided that the Schwarzschild mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math> is set equal to the sum of the two individual masses <math display=\"inline\">m_1</math> and <math display=\"inline\">m_2</math>. This is important in predicting the motion of [[binary star]]s in general relativity.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is named in honour of its discoverer [[Karl Schwarzschild]], who found the solution in 1915, only about a month after the publication of Einstein's theory of general relativity. It was the first exact solution of the Einstein field equations other than the trivial [[Minkowski spacetime|flat space solution]].\n\n==Schwarzschild metric==\n\n{{See also|Schwarzschild metric|Deriving the Schwarzschild solution}}\n\nAn exact solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which corresponds to the external gravitational field of an uncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math>.  The Schwarzschild solution can be written as<ref name=Schwarzschild_metric>Landau and Lifshitz, pp. 299&ndash;301.</ref>\n\n:<math>\nc^2 {d \\tau}^{2} = \n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} dt^{2} - \\frac{dr^{2}}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} - r^{2} d\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta \\, d\\varphi^{2}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\tau</math> is the proper time (time measured by a clock moving with the particle) in seconds,\n: <math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]] in meters per second,\n: <math>t</math> is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity) in seconds,\n: <math>r</math> is the radial coordinate (circumference of a circle centered on the star divided by <math>2\\pi</math>) in meters,\n: <math>\\theta</math> is the [[colatitude]] (angle from North) in radians,\n: <math>\\varphi</math> is the [[longitude]] in radians, and\n: <math>r_s</math> is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] (in meters) of the massive body, which is related to its mass <math display=\"inline\">M</math> by\n:: <math>\nr_{\\rm s} = \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}},\n</math>\n: where <math display=\"inline\">G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity is recovered in the limit as the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{r_s}{r}</math> goes to zero.  In that limit, the metric returns to that defined by [[special relativity]].\n\nIn practice, this ratio is almost always extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math> of the Earth is roughly 9&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch); at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion.  The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is much larger, roughly 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{r_s}{r}</math> is roughly 4 parts in a million.  A [[white dwarf]] star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface is roughly 250 parts in a million.  The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s (where the ratio is roughly 50%) and [[black hole]]s.\n\n==Orbits of test particles==\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|250px|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime; note the [[apsidal precession]] on the right.]]\nWe may simplify the problem by using symmetry to eliminate one variable from consideration.  Since the Schwarzschild metric is symmetrical about <math display=\"inline\">\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>, any geodesic that begins moving in that plane will remain in that plane indefinitely (the plane is [[totally geodesic]]).  Therefore, we orient the coordinate system so that the orbit of the particle lies in that plane, and fix the <math display=\"inline\">\\theta</math> coordinate to be <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> so that the metric (of this plane) simplifies to\n\n:<math>\nc^2 d \\tau^{2} = \n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} dt^{2} - \\frac{dr^{2}}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} - r^{2} d\\varphi^{2}.\n</math>\n\nTwo [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] can then be identified (cf. the derivation given [[#Lagrangian approach|below]]). One is the total energy <math display=\"inline\">E</math>:\n:<math>\n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} = \\frac{E}{m c^{2}}.\n</math>\n\nand the other is the [[Specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]]:\n:<math>\nh = \\frac{L}{\\mu} = r^{2} \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\tau},\n</math>\n\nwhere L is the total angular momentum of the two bodies, and <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> is the [[reduced mass]]. When <math display=\"inline\">M \\gg m</math>, the reduced mass is approximately equal to <math display=\"inline\">m</math>. Sometimes it is assumed that <math display=\"inline\">m = \\mu</math> In the case of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] this simplification introduces an error more than twice as large as the relativistic effect. When discussing geodesics, <math display=\"inline\">m</math> can be considered fictitious, and what matters is the constants <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E}{m}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h</math>. In order to cover all possible geodesics, we need to consider cases in which <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E}{m}</math> is infinite (giving trajectories of [[photon]]s) or [[imaginary number|imaginary]] (for [[tachyonic]] geodesics). For the photonic case, we also need to specify a number corresponding to the ratio of the two constants, namely <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{mh}{E}</math>, which may be zero or a non-zero real number.\n\nSubstituting these constants into the definition of the Schwarzschild metric\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) c^{2} \\left( \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} - \n\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}} \\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} - \nr^{2} \\left( \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2},\n</math>\n\nyields an equation of motion for the radius as a function of the proper time <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\right).\n</math>\n\nThe formal solution to this is\n\n:<math>\n\\tau = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\right)}}.\n</math>\n\nNote that the square root will be imaginary for tachyonic geodesics.\n\nUsing the relation higher up between <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dt}{d\\tau}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">E</math>, we can also write\n\n:<math>\nt = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm c\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right)\\sqrt{1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right)\\frac{m^2 c^2}{E^2}}}.\n</math>\n\nSince [[asymptotically]] the integrand is inversely proportional to <math display=\"inline\">r - r_{\\rm s}</math>, this shows that in the <math display=\"inline\">r, \\theta, \\varphi, t</math> frame of reference if <math display=\"inline\">r</math> approaches <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math> it does so exponentially without ever reaching it. However, as a function of <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math>, <math display=\"inline\">r</math> does reach <math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>.\n\nThe above solutions are valid while the integrand is finite, but a total solution may involve two or an infinity of pieces, each described by the integral but with alternating signs for the square root.\n\nWhen <math display=\"inline\">E = mc^2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">h = 0</math>, we can solve for <math display=\"inline\">t</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\tau</math> explicitly:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     t &= \\text{constant} \\pm \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}} + \\ln\\frac{\\left|\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}}} - 1\\right|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}}} + 1}\\right) \\\\\n  \\tau &= \\text{constant}\\pm\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand for photonic geodesics (<math display=\"inline\">m = 0</math>) with zero angular momentum\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n     t &= \\text{constant} \\pm \\frac{1}{c}\\left(r + r_{\\rm s}\\ln\\left|\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}} - 1\\right|\\right) \\\\\n  \\tau &= \\text{constant}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(Although the proper time is trivial in the photonic case, one can define an affine parameter <math display=\"inline\">\\lambda</math>, and then the solution to the geodesic equation is <math display=\"inline\">r = c_1\\lambda + c_2</math>.) \n\nAnother solvable case is that in which <math display=\"inline\">E = 0</math> and <math display=\"inline\">t</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> are constant. In the volume where <math display=\"inline\">r < r_s</math> this gives for the proper time\n\n:<math>\\tau=\\text{constant}\\pm\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\arcsin\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\left(1-\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nThis is close to solutions with <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E^2}{m^2}</math> small and positive. Outside of ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'' the <math display=\"inline\">E = 0</math> solution is tachyonic and the \"proper time\" is space-like:\n\n:<math>\\tau=\\text{constant}\\pm i\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}c\\left(\\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}-1}\\right)+\\sqrt{\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}\\left(\\frac r{r_{\\rm s}}-1\\right)}\\right).</math>\n\nThis is close to other tachyonic solutions with <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{E^2}{m^2}</math> small and negative. The constant <math display=\"inline\">t</math> tachyonic geodesic outside ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'' is not continued by a constant <math display=\"inline\">t</math> geodesic inside ''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'', but rather continues into a \"parallel exterior region\" (see [[Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates]]). Other tachyonic solutions can enter a black hole and re-exit into the parallel exterior region. The constant ''t'' solution inside the event horizon (''<math display=\"inline\">r_s</math>'') is continued by a constant ''t'' solution in a [[white hole]].\n\nWhen the angular momentum is not zero we can replace the dependence on proper time by a dependence on the angle <math display=\"inline\">\\varphi</math> using the definition of <math display=\"inline\">h</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} =\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{ r^{2}}{h} \\right)^{2},\n</math>\n\nwhich yields the equation for the orbit\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{r^{4}}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r^{4}}{a^{2}} + r^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere, for brevity, two length-scales, <math display=\"inline\">a</math> and  <math display=\"inline\">b</math>, have been defined by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a &= \\frac{h}{c}, \\\\\n  b &= \\frac{cL}{E} = \\frac{hmc}E.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote that in the tachyonic case, <math display=\"inline\">a</math> will be imaginary and <math display=\"inline\">b</math> real or infinite.\n\nThe same equation can also be derived using a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian approach]]<ref>Whittaker 1937.</ref> or the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]]<ref name=\"ll_1975_HJ\" >Landau and Lifshitz (1975), pp. 306&ndash;309.</ref> (see [[#Alternative derivations of orbit equation|below]]). The solution of the orbit equation is\n\n:<math>\n\\varphi = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\pm r^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{a^{2}} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\right)}}.\n</math>\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass elliptic function]] <math display=\"inline\">\\wp</math>.<ref>Gibbons and Vyska, \"The Application of Weierstrass elliptic functions to\nSchwarzschild Null Geodesics,\" https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6508</ref>\n\n==Local and delayed velocities==\n\nUnlike in classical mechanics, in Schwarzschild coordinates <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{{\\rm d}r}{{\\rm d}\\tau}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">r\\ \\frac{{\\rm d}\\varphi}{{\\rm d}\\tau}</math> are not the radial <math display=\"inline\">v_{\\parallel}</math> and transverse <math display=\"inline\">v_{\\perp}</math> components of the local [[velocity]] <math display=\"inline\">v</math> (relative to a stationary observer), instead they give the components for the [[proper velocity|celerity]] which are related to <math display=\"inline\">v</math> by\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm d}r}{{\\rm d}\\tau} = v_\\parallel \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}\\ \\gamma</math>\n\nfor the radial and\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm d}\\varphi}{{\\rm d}\\tau} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r} \\ \\gamma</math>\n\nfor the transverse component of motion, with <math display=\"inline\">v^2 = v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2</math>. The coordinate bookkeeper far away from the scene observes the [[Shapiro_delay|shapiro-delayed]] velocity <math display=\"inline\">\\hat{v}</math>, which is given by the relation\n\n:<math>{\\hat v}_{\\perp} = v_{\\perp}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}</math> and <math>{\\hat v}_{\\parallel} = v_{\\parallel}\\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)</math>.\n\nThe time dilation factor between the bookkeeper and the moving test-particle can also be put into the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{{\\rm d}\\tau}{{\\rm d}t} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}}{\\gamma}</math>\n\nwhere the numerator is the gravitational, and the denominator is the kinematic component of the time dilation.

For further information, please see the article on the [[classical central-force problem]].</ref> if it is expressed in terms of the inverse radius <math display=\"inline\">u = \\frac{1}{r}</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{du}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - u r_{\\rm s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{a^{2}} + u^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation is a [[cubic function|cubic polynomial]], which has three [[root of a function|roots]], denoted here as ''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>, and ''u''<sub>3</sub>\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{du}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = r_{\\rm s}  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right) \n</math>\n\nThe sum of the three roots equals the coefficient of the ''u''<sup>2</sup> term\n\n:<math>\nu_{1} + u_{2} + u_{3} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\rm s}}\n</math>\n\nA cubic polynomial with real coefficients can either have three real roots, or one real root and two [[complex conjugate]] roots. If all three roots are [[real number]]s, the roots are labeled so that  ''u''<sub>1</sub> &lt; ''u''<sub>2</sub> &lt; ''u''<sub>3</sub>.  If instead there is only one real root, then that is denoted as ''u''<sub>3</sub>; the complex conjugate roots are labeled ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub>.  Using [[Descartes' rule of signs]], there can be at most one negative root; ''u''<sub>1</sub> is negative if and only if ''b'' &lt; ''a''.  As discussed below, the roots are useful in determining the types of possible orbits.\n\nGiven this labeling of the roots, the solution of the fundamental orbital equation is\n\n:<math>\nu = u_{1} + \\left( u_{2} - u_{1} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{sn}^{2}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi \\sqrt{r_{\\rm s} \\left( u_{3} - u_{1} \\right)} + \\delta \\right)\n</math>\n \nwhere sn represents the ''sinus amplitudinus function'' (one of the [[Jacobi elliptic function]]s) and \u03b4 is a constant of integration reflecting the initial position. The [[elliptic modulus]] ''k'' of this elliptic function is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{u_{2} - u_{1}}{u_{3} - u_{1}}}\n</math>\n\n===Newtonian limit===\n\nTo recover the Newtonian solution for the planetary orbits, one takes the limit as the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>s</sub> goes to zero.  In this case, the third root ''u''<sub>3</sub> becomes roughly <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{1}{r_\\text{s}}</math>, and much larger than ''u''<sub>1</sub> or ''u''<sub>2</sub>.  Therefore, the modulus ''k'' tends to zero; in that limit, sn becomes the [[trigonometric functions|trigonometric sine function]]\n\n:<math>\nu = u_{1} + \\left( u_{2} - u_{1} \\right) \\, \\sin^{2}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi + \\delta \\right)\n</math>\n \nConsistent with Newton's solutions for planetary motions, this formula describes a focal conic of eccentricity ''e''\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{u_{2} - u_{1}}{u_{2} + u_{1}}\n</math>\n\nIf ''u''<sub>1</sub> is a positive real number, then the orbit is an [[ellipse]] where ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub> represent the distances of furthest and closest approach, respectively. If ''u''<sub>1</sub> is zero or a negative real number, the orbit is a [[parabola]] or a [[hyperbola]], respectively. In these latter two cases, ''u''<sub>2</sub> represents the distance of closest approach; since the orbit goes to infinity (''u'' = 0), there is no distance of furthest approach.\n\n===Roots and overview of possible orbits===\n\nA root represents a point of the orbit where the derivative vanishes, i.e., where <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{du}{d\\phi} = 0</math>.  At such a turning point, ''u'' reaches a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection point, depending on the value of the second derivative, which is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d^{2}u}{d\\varphi^{2}} = \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{2} \\left[  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right)   +  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{3} \\right)   +  \\left( u - u_{1} \\right)  \\left( u - u_{2} \\right)  \\right]\n</math>\n\nIf all three roots are distinct real numbers, the second derivative is positive, negative, and positive at  ''u''<sub>1</sub>,''u''<sub>2</sub>, and ''u''<sub>3</sub>, respectively.  It follows that a graph of ''u'' versus \u03c6 may either oscillate between ''u''<sub>1</sub> and ''u''<sub>2</sub>, or it may move away from ''u''<sub>3</sub> towards infinity (which corresponds to ''r'' going to zero). If ''u''<sub>1</sub> is negative, only part of an \"oscillation\" will actually occur. This corresponds to the particle coming from infinity, getting near the central mass, and then moving away again toward infinity, like the hyperbolic trajectory in the classical solution.\n\nIf the particle has just the right amount of energy for its angular momentum, ''u''<sub>2</sub> and ''u''<sub>3</sub> will merge. There are three solutions in this case. The orbit may spiral in to <math display=\"inline\">r = \\frac{1}{u_2} = \\frac{1}{u_3}</math>, approaching that radius as (asymptotically) a decreasing exponential in \u03c6, \u03c4, or ''t''. Or one can have a circular orbit at that radius. Or one can have an orbit that spirals down from that radius to the central point. The radius in question is called the inner radius and is between <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{3}{2}</math> and 3 times ''r<sub>s</sub>''. A circular orbit also results when ''u''<sub>2</sub> is equal to ''u''<sub>1</sub>, and this is called the outer radius. These different types of orbits are discussed below.\n\nIf the particle comes at the central mass with sufficient energy and sufficiently low angular momentum then only ''u''<sub>1</sub> will be real.

The Christoffel symbol depends only on the [[metric tensor]] <math display=\"inline\">g_{\\mu\\nu}</math>, or rather on how it changes with position.

The basic idea is that, due to gravitational slowing of time, parts of a wave-front closer to a gravitating mass move more slowly than those further away, thus bending the direction of the wave-front's propagation.\n\nUsing general covariance, the [[Hamilton&ndash;Jacobi equation]] for a single particle of unit mass can be expressed in arbitrary coordinates as\n\n:<math>\ng^{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x^{\\mu}} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x^{\\nu}} = c^{2}.\n</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to the Hamiltonian formulation above, with the partial derivatives of the action taking the place of the generalized momenta.

She spent 17 years with the organization, also holding posts as a senior policy advisor for the [[Latin America]] and Caribbean Division and then, as the first director of the Conservancy\u2019s Global Climate Change Initiative. During her time with the group, Nelson worked in more than 25 countries, and was in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 when [[President George H.W. Bush]] signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit, the U.S. commitment to help fight [[global warming]].\n\nWhile at [[The Nature Conservancy]], Nelson advocated for forest protection and restoration as a critical climate change mitigation strategy and an essential component of public policies to address global warming.

This college was founded by Indian businessman Sir Ness Wadia.\n\n==Early history==\nIt has been well represented on University Boards of Studies where its faculty members have been providing valuable inputs to the Board\nmembers. Within the institution, teachers are working on drafting syllabi for its own autonomous courses. The heads of departments meet to ensure that the syllabus is fully covered.\n\n===Background===\n*The background of the Ness Wadia College of Commerce can be traced back to June 1959 when the first pre-degree commerce class was started under the auspices of the Modern Education Society. The class was held in the [[Nowrosjee Wadia College]] of Arts and Science. In the years that followed a need to establish a full-fledged commerce college was identified.\n*In 1969, the commerce wing came to be established as an independent college of commerce, named after the industrialist and philanthropist Sir Ness Wadia (1873-1952). His brother Sir Cusrow Wadia also contributed to the establishment of the college. The college moved into its present premises with a building of its own in 1971.

This college was founded by Indian businessman Sir Ness Wadia.\n\n==Early history==\nIt has been well represented on University Boards of Studies where its faculty members have been providing valuable inputs to the Board\nmembers. Within the institution, teachers are working on drafting syllabi for its own autonomous courses. The heads of departments meet to ensure that the syllabus is fully covered.\n\n===Background===\n*The background of the Ness Wadia College of Commerce can be traced back to June 1959 when the first pre-degree commerce class was started under the auspices of the Modern Education Society. The class was held in the [[Nowrosjee Wadia College]] of Arts and Science. In the years that followed a need to establish a full-fledged commerce college was identified.\n*In 1969, the commerce wing came to be established as an independent college of commerce, named after the industrialist and philanthropist Sir Ness Wadia (1873-1952). His brother Sir Cusrow Wadia also contributed to the establishment of the college. The college moved into its present premises with a building of its own in 1971. The college was inaugurated on 15 July 1969, by Dr. H. V. Pataskar, the then vice-chancellor of the University of Pune.\n*It came to be headed by Dr. B. S.

It runs completely underground for a length of {{convert|31.8|km|mi|1}} through 40 stations and connects [[Spandau]], via [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], to [[Gropiusstadt]] and [[Rudow]]. The line was originally the south-eastern branch of the Nord-S\u00fcd-Bahn ([[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U6]]) that ran between the branching point at Belle-Alliance-Stra\u00dfe ([[Mehringdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mehringdamm]]) and [[Grenzallee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Grenzallee]]; however, in the 1960s, this stretch was separated from the rest of the line and extended at each end to form a new line. As of 2007, the U7 is [[Berlin]]'s longest underground line, both in terms of absolute length and total travel time, and one of the longest subterranean lines in Europe.\n\n==Route==\nStarting in [[Rudow (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rudow]], at the junction of Gross-Ziethener Chaussee and Neuk\u00f6llner Stra\u00dfe, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west in the [[Gropiusstadt]] area. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches [[Britz-S\u00fcd (Berlin U-Bahn)|Britz-S\u00fcd station]], where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as [[Blaschkoallee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Blaschkoallee station]] before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]] while under Karl-Marx-Stra\u00dfe, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, S\u00fcdstern, and Gneisenaustra\u00dfe until it reaches [[Mehringdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mehringdamm]] after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the {{lang|de|Tempelhofer Ufer}} ({{lang-en|[[Tempelhof]] waterside}}) to [[M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke (Berlin U-Bahn)|M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke station]], with another taking it back and below the area of the former {{lang|de|Anhalter G\u00fcterbahnhof}} ({{lang-en|Anhalter goods station}}). The route continues west under Yorckstra\u00dfe, Willmanndamm, Grunewaldstra\u00dfe, Bayerischer Platz, and Berliner Stra\u00dfe, then heads north under Brandenburgische Stra\u00dfe to [[Adenauerplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Adenauerplatz station]].\n\nA curve into Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe takes the U7 north to [[Bismarckstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Bismarckstra\u00dfe station]], where it makes a further turn into Richard-Wagner-Stra\u00dfe, travelling under this road and its northern continuations Wintersteinstra\u00dfe and S\u00f6mmeringstra\u00dfe. At [[Berlin Jungfernheide railway station|Jungfernheide]] station, the U7 crosses the Ringbahn for the second time before passing under the [[Westhafen Canal|Westhafenkanal]]. The track then turns west through a wide arc and follows Siemensdamm and Nonnendammallee. It passes to the south of the [[Spandau Citadel]] below the road Am Juliusturm, runs under the Old Town of [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], and ends at [[Rathaus Spandau (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rathaus Spandau station]].\n\nThe U7 passes through 12 districts of Berlin: [[Rudow]], [[Gropiusstadt]], [[Britz]], [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], [[Kreuzberg]], [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], [[Wilmersdorf]], [[Charlottenburg]], [[Charlottenburg-Nord]], [[Siemensstadt]], [[Haselhorst]], and [[Spandau]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Construction of the North-South Underground: 1901-1930 ===\n\n[[Image:Nord-S\u00fcd-Bahn U-Bahn Berlin Karte.png|310px|thumb|Map of the former Nord-S\u00fcd Bahn in 1930]]\n\nAround 1901, the city of Berlin planned to build an underground railway line below [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] to connect the north to the south. [[Werner von Siemens]] also had plans for a north\u2013south line, under Nobelstra\u00dfe, at the same time, but permission for these was declined on the grounds that public transport should be in municipal ownership. Consequently, Berlin started the construction of the Nord\u2013S\u00fcd-Bahn (''North\u2013South railway'') to link [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]] and [[Tempelhof]] (as of 2007, part of the [[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U6]]), with a branch to Neuk\u00f6lln.\n\n[[World War I]] made the construction work difficult, and finally stopped it completely. In 1919, work started again, but not without further complications. In 1921, during the time of [[hyperinflation]], filling up the existing tunnels was considered as financial turmoil hit hard. The construction work was continued, however, and the first tunnel section from [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hallesches Tor]] to Stettiner Bahnhof (later renamed [[Naturkundemuseum (Berlin U-Bahn)|Naturkundemuseum]]) was opened on 30 January 1923.\n\nThe history of the U7 began with the construction of the branch to Neuk\u00f6lln, when the stretch from Hallesches Tor to [[Gneisenaustra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Gneisenaustra\u00dfe]] was built; it opened on 9 April 1924. With inflation still taking its toll, the construction work proceeded in small steps only. The extension to Hasenheide station, named after a nearby park (and later renamed ''[[S\u00fcdstern (Berlin U-Bahn)|S\u00fcdstern]]''), followed on 14 December of the same year. As the financial situation of Germany and Berlin improved, so too did the underground railway construction, including the branch to Neuk\u00f6lln.\n\nAt [[Hermannplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannplatz]] station, which resembles something of an U-Bahn cathedral, the first underground rail\u2013rail crossing in Berlin was developed; transfer to the GN-Bahn (later the ''[[U8 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U8]]'') was intended at this station. The station is also the first Berlin underground station to use escalators. The section from Hasenheide to Bergstra\u00dfe (later ''[[Karl-Marx-Stra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Karl-Marx-Stra\u00dfe]]'') was put into operation on 11 April 1926. The final stage of the Neuk\u00f6lln branch at that time, the 1.5 kilometre-long (0.9&nbsp;mi) extension to [[Grenzallee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Grenzallee]], was put into operation on 21 December 1930\u2014the same day of the opening of what would become the [[U5 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U5]] line\u2014during one of the largest underground opening celebrations. Underground passengers could then travel from Seestra\u00dfe (U6), through the city centre, to either [[Tempelhof (Berlin U-Bahn)|Tempelhof]] or Grenzallee.\n\nThe post-war underground lines were marked out from their 1901\u20131914 predecessors by their larger tunnels and trains, in order to provide greater competition with the privately run {{lang|de|Berliner Hochbahngesellschaft}} ({{lang-en|Berlin Elevated Railway Company}}). The new trains and tunnels, which were wider but used the same [[standard gauge|standard-gauge]] track, were described as {{lang|de|[[Berlin U-Bahn#Gro\u00dfprofil (large profile)|Gro\u00dfprofil]]}} ({{lang-en|large profile}}).\n\n===Connection to Rudow===\n[[Image:Ubahn-rudow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rudow terminus station platform.]]\nFollowing [[World War II]]\u2014in which many of Berlin's residences were destroyed\u2014large new housing developments were needed. Britz and Britz-Buckow-Rudow (BBR; later renamed ''Gropiusstadt''), which were established in the south of [[West Berlin]], required a new rapid-transit railway connection to the West Berlin city centre; the construction work for the underground railway began on 2 November 1959.\n\nThe track from [[Grenzallee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Grenzallee]] to [[Britz-S\u00fcd (Berlin U-Bahn)|Britz-S\u00fcd]] opened on 28 September 1963.\n\nConstruction began from Britz-S\u00fcd to Rudow on 2 January 1965. Travel to [[Zwickauer Damm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Zwickauer Damm]] was made possible on 2 January 1970, and [[Rudow (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rudow]] received connection to Line 7 on 1 July 1972.\n\n===Extension to the west===\nThe branch station Belle-Alliance-Stra\u00dfe (later renamed ''[[Mehringdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mehringdamm]]''), which opened in 1924, had three tracks: a connection to Tempelhof led from the first platform; to Neuk\u00f6lln from the second; and to the city centre from the third. A separation of the Neuk\u00f6llner branch from the North-South Line was decided upon in order to avoid an overload on the transfer station [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hallesches Tor]]. Therefore, Line 7 was extended west from Belle-Alliance-Stra\u00dfe. The construction work began in the middle of 1962, and was completed on 26 February 1966 with the link to [[M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke (Berlin U-Bahn)|M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke]] station. Beside the construction of M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke station, changes to Mehringdamm station\u2014which would become a transfer point between unbranched lines\u2014were necessary.\n\nThe further extension of Line 7 was accomplished with subsidy funds. The construction of the track from M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke to [[Fehrbelliner Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Fehrbelliner Platz]] started on 1 July 1962, and finished on 29 January 1971.\n[[File:UBahnhf-Altstadt-spandau.JPG|thumb|right|176px|Altstadt Spandau: Last station before the terminus Rathaus Spandau]]\n\n===In three stages to Spandau: 1960-1984===\nAt the end of the 1960s, ideas about an underground railway line to Spandau arose again. The planned extension to Line 7 through [[Mierendorffplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mierendorffplatz]], [[Berlin Jungfernheide station|Jungfernheide]], and Nonnendammallee was chosen to improve public transportation to [[Siemensstadt]]\u2014important for its many jobs. Already at the time, there were plans to build a subway to Spandau. First steps were taken with the extension of the line of today's line [[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]] to [[Ruhleben (Berlin U-Bahn)|Ruhleben]]. The terminus Ruhleben is located directly on the district border to Spandau. Feeder and distribution traffic, until 1967 by [[Trams in Berlin|tram]], replaced by several bus lines, provided solely for the development of Spandau on the subway station Ruhleben.\n\nThe construction work for the section [[Fehrbelliner Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Fehrbelliner Platz]]\u2013[[Richard-Wagner-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Richard-Wagner-Platz]] began in 1969 which is H-West-II.<!-- ? --> By 1970, the then shortest and less frequented subway line of Berlin, line 5, oscillated between [[Deutsche Oper (Berlin U-Bahn)|Deutsche Oper]] and [[Richard-Wagner-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Richard Wagner Platz]]. Their old route was shut down for passenger traffic, and a new station was built several meters below the old one. The remaining tunnels could be converted into an operating section, making it the second exchange line between small and large profile after the Waisentunnel at [[Berlin Alexanderplatz station|Alexanderplatz station]]. The route continues under the Brandenburgische Stra\u00dfe and crosses the [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] at [[Adenauerplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Adenauerplatz]], where a train station was also built. The station was created as a crossing station as it was (and officially still is) planned to extend the current U-Bahn line [[U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U1]] from [[Uhlandstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Uhlandstra\u00dfe]] to Adenauerplatz. After Adenauerplatz, the track swings under Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe and passes under the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]].\n\n[[Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe]] was constructed with a pedestrian passage to the [[Berlin-Charlottenburg station|Charlottenburg]] [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] station. At [[Bismarckstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Bismarckstra\u00dfe]], a new underground railway station had to be built, since the pre-existing tunnel of Line 1 (later renamed [[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]]) was in a bad condition and necessitated extensive repair works. After Bismarckstra\u00dfe, 23 houses had to be [[underpinning|underpinned]], therefore the [[tunnel boring machine|shield drive]] was used for tunnelling this section. The stage from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz was put into operation on 28 April 1978.\n\nEarthworks and some motorway construction began at Charlottenburg-Nord on 3 July 1967, which is located at Siemensstadt. Construction began for the section to Rohrdamm from 1973. The construction work for the next section towards Spandau began in 1973. The route leads north of the station Richard-Wagner-Platz further under the S\u00f6mmeringstra\u00dfe. Halfway to [[Mierendorffplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mierendorffplatz]], the [[Spree]] is underpassed using the [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson construction method]]. After a few meters, the station follows Mierendorffplatz. North of the station, the route makes a wide berth to reach the existing S-Bahn station [[Berlin Jungfernheide station|Jungfernheide]]. Here, similar to the station [[Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]], the platforms were built on two levels. The other tracks are kept until today for a possible extension of the [[U5 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U5]], which is to lead from Lehrter to [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]] via [[Turmstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Turmstra\u00dfe]] and [[Berlin Jungfernheide station|Jungfernheide]]. However, the plan was cancelled due to the budget situation, the longer length of the extension north of Jungfernheide station due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport. Trams will be replacing the U-Bahn extension. The finished extension is now used for firefighting exercises and is no longer usable for any future line. The extension to [[Rohrdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rohrdamm]] followed on 1 October 1980, providing the district of Spandau with its first underground connection.\n\nThe costs of the extension to the Spandau city centre rose to unexpected heights: it consumed 680 million [[German mark]]s as a result of the need to undercut the [[Havel]] river and the swampy ground in the surrounding area. Construction began on 4 July 1977. Several variants were investigated. One plan was to lead the subway through the [[Haselhorst|Haselhorster]] village center, with a downside that the [[Havel]] had to be undercut at one of its widest points. Another variant was that the subway would cross the existing Spandau suburban railway of the S-Bahn and the subway would be led from the south to [[Rathaus Spandau|Spandau city hall]]. This plan crystallized very late, as the 200-kilometer<!-- ? --> plan envisaged to lead the U7 over Falkenseer Platz into Falkenhagener Feld. This resulted in the disadvantage that the Spandau old town could not be connected, which was the main goal of the extension. Finally, they decided to continue the route along the Nonnendammallee or the street Am Juliusturm, south past the Spandau Citadel and then directly to the old town and on to the Spandau town hall, with the development of [[Falkenhagener Feld]] taken over by the extension of the small profile route of the line U2 of Ruhleben. On 1 October 1984, the last section of the U7 from Rohrdamm to [[Rathaus Spandau (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rathaus Spandau]] was opened, with the then [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor of Germany]], [[Helmut Kohl]], in attendance.\n\n==Future plans==\nIn 2014, the Berlin city government published the Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plan, according to which the long-postponed northern extension of the U7 to [[Staaken]] is expected to begin construction in 2021 and be completed in 2025.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A southern extension from Rudow to [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] via Neuhofer Stra\u00dfe, Lieselotte-Berger-Stra\u00dfe, and [[Sch\u00f6nefeld]] has already been shelved as the expected patronage was not high enough to justify such an expansion. However, in light of the ballot measure aimed at keeping [[Tegel Airport]] open after the opening of the new Brandenburg Airport, governing mayor [[Michael M\u00fcller (politician)|Michael M\u00fcller]] suggested an extension of U7 towards Sch\u00f6nefeld and/or the new airport which was greeted with enthusiasm by local politicians in Sch\u00f6nefeld and the Berlin district of Neuk\u00f6lln.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/u7-und-u8-in-berlin-senat-prueft-u-bahn-ausbau-zum-ber-und-ins-maerkische-viertel/20007154.html| title=Senat pr\u00fcft U-Bahn-Ausbau zum BER und ins M\u00e4rkische Viertel| website=Der Tagesspiegel| date=1 July 2017| language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/ubahnlinie-7-ber-senat-beraet-verlaengerung| title=Wird die U7 jetzt doch bis zum BER verl\u00e4ngert?| language=de| website=BZ| date=30 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rbb24.de/politik/Flughafen-BER/BER-Aktuelles/akteure_aktuell/2018/02/buergermeister-fuer-u7-verlaengerung-nach-schoenefeld.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703032249/https://www.rbb24.de/politik/Flughafen-BER/BER-Aktuelles/akteure_aktuell/2018/02/buergermeister-fuer-u7-verlaengerung-nach-schoenefeld.html| archivedate=3 July 2018| title=B\u00fcrgermeister fordern U7-Verl\u00e4ngerung nach Sch\u00f6nefeld| language=de| date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Line colour and name==\nIn 1966, the branched C line had a violet map colour.

It runs completely underground for a length of {{convert|31.8|km|mi|1}}, through 40 stations; and connects [[Spandau]], via [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], to [[Gropiusstadt]] and [[Rudow]]. The line was originally the south-eastern branch of the Nord-S\u00fcd-Bahn ([[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U6]]) that ran between the branching point at Belle-Alliance-Stra\u00dfe ([[Mehringdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mehringdamm]]) and [[Grenzallee (Berlin U-Bahn)|Grenzallee]]; however, in the 1960s, this stretch was separated from the rest of the line and extended at each end to form a new line. As of 2007, the U7 is [[Berlin]]'s longest underground line, both in terms of absolute length and total travel time and one of the longest subterranean lines in Europe.\n\n==Route==\nStarting in Rudow, at the junction of Gross-Ziethener Chaussee and Neuk\u00f6llner Stra\u00dfe, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west under Gropiusstadt. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches Britz-S\u00fcd station, where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as Blaschkoallee before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]] while under Karl-Marx-Stra\u00dfe, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, S\u00fcdstern and Gneisenaustra\u00dfe until it reaches [[Mehringdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mehringdamm]] after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the {{lang|de|Tempelhofer Ufer}} ({{lang-en|Tempelhof waterside}}) to [[M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke (Berlin U-Bahn)|M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke]] station, with another taking it back and below the area of the former {{lang|de|Anhalter G\u00fcterbahnhof}} ({{lang-en|Anhalter goods station}}). The route continues west under Yorckstra\u00dfe, Willmanndamm, Grunewaldstra\u00dfe, Bayerischer Platz and Berliner Stra\u00dfe, then heads north under Brandenburgische Stra\u00dfe to Adenauerplatz.\n\nA curve into Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe takes the U7 north to Bismarckstra\u00dfe, where it makes a further turn into Richard-Wagner-Stra\u00dfe, travelling under this road and its northern continuations Wintersteinstra\u00dfe and S\u00f6mmeringstra\u00dfe. At [[Berlin Jungfernheide railway station|Jungfernheide]] station, the U7 crosses the Ringbahn for the second time before passing under the [[Westhafen Canal|Westhafenkanal]]. The track then turns west through a wide arc and follows Siemensdamm and Nonnendammallee. It passes to the south of the [[Spandau Citadel]] below the road Am Juliusturm, runs under the Old Town of Spandau, and ends at the Spandau city hall.\n\nThe U7 passes through 12 districts of Berlin: Rudow, Gropiusstadt, [[Britz]], Neuk\u00f6lln, [[Kreuzberg]], [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], [[Wilmersdorf]], [[Charlottenburg]], Charlottenburg Nord, [[Siemensstadt]], [[Haselhorst]] and Spandau.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Construction of the North-South Underground: 1901-1930 ===\n\n[[Image:Nord-S\u00fcd-Bahn U-Bahn Berlin Karte.png|310px|thumb|Map of the former Nord-S\u00fcd Bahn in 1930]]\n\nAround 1901, the city of Berlin planned to build an underground railway line below [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] to connect the north to the south.

The construction of the track from M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke to [[Fehrbelliner Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Fehrbelliner Platz]] started on 1 July 1962, and finished on 29 January 1971.\n[[File:UBahnhf-Altstadt-spandau.JPG|thumb|right|176px|Altstadt Spandau: Last station before the terminus Rathaus Spandau]]\n\n===In three stages to Spandau: 1960-1984===\nAt the end of the 1960s, ideas about an underground railway line to Spandau arose again. The planned extension to Line 7 through Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and Nonnendammallee was chosen to improve public transportation to Siemensstadt\u2014important for its many jobs. Already at the time, there were plans to build a subway to Spandau. First steps were taken with the extension of the line of today's line U2 to Ruhleben. The terminus Ruhleben is located directly on the district border to Spandau. Feeder and distribution traffic, until 1967 by tram, replaced by several bus lines, provided solely for the development of Spandau on the subway station Ruhleben.\n\nThe construction work for the section Fehrbelliner Platz\u2013[[Richard-Wagner-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Richard-Wagner-Platz]] began in 1969 which is H-West-II. By 1970, the then shortest and less frequented subway line of Berlin, the then line 5, oscillated between Deutsche Oper and Richard Wagner Platz. Their old route was now shut down for passenger traffic, and it was a new station built several meters below the old one. The remaining tunnels could be converted into an operating section, which is thus a second exchange line between small and large profile after the Waisentunnel at Alexanderplatz station. The route continues under the Brandenburgische Stra\u00dfe and crosses the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm at Adenauerplatz, where a train station was also built. This was already created as a crossing station, because it is still officially planned to extend the current U-Bahn line U1 from Uhlandstra\u00dfe to Adenauerplatz. After that, the track swings under Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe and passes under the city railway a few meters further.\n\n[[Adenauerplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Adenauerplatz]] station was designed as a transfer station to accommodate the planned connection to [[Uhlandstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Uhlandstra\u00dfe]].  [[Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe]] was constructed with a pedestrian passage to the [[Berlin-Charlottenburg railway station|Charlottenburg]] [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] station. At [[Bismarckstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Bismarckstra\u00dfe]], a new underground railway station had to be built, since the pre-existing tunnel of Line 1 (later renamed ''[[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]]'') was in a bad condition that necessitated extensive repair works. After Bismarckstra\u00dfe, 23 houses had to be [[underpinning|underpinned]], therefore the [[tunnel boring machine|shield drive]] was used for tunnelling this section. The stage from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz was put into operation on 28 April 1978.\n\nEarthworks and some motorway construction began at Charlottenburg-Nord on 3 July 1967, which is located at Siemensstadt. Construction began for the section to Rohrdamm from 1973. The construction work for the next section towards Spandau began in 1973. The route leads north of the station Richard-Wagner-Platz further under the S\u00f6mmeringstra\u00dfe. Halfway to the underground station Mierendorffplatz, the Spree is underpassed. Here one chose the method of the caisson construction method. After a few meters, the station follows Mierendorffplatz. North of it makes the route a wide berth to reach the existing S-Bahn station Jungfernheide. Here, similar to the station Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe, the platforms were built on two levels. The other tracks are kept until today for a possible extension of today's line U5. This is to lead from Lehrter station via Turmstra\u00dfe, Jungfernheide to Tegel Airport. However, the plan was cancelled due to the budget situation, the longer length of the extension and north of Jungfernheide station due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport. Trams replace their U-Bahn line. The finished extension is now used for firefighting exercises and is no longer usable for any future line. The extension to [[Rohrdamm (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rohrdamm]] following on 1 October 1980, providing the district of Spandau with its first underground connection.\n\nThe costs of the extension to the Spandau city centre rose to unexpected heights: it consumed 680 million [[German mark]]s as a result of the need to undercut the [[Havel]] river and the swampy ground in the surrounding area. Construction began on 4 July 1977. Several variants were investigated. So there were considerations to lead the subway through the Haselhorster village center. The downside was that the Havel had to be undercut at one of its widest points. Another variant was that the subway would cross the existing Spandau suburban railway of the S-Bahn and the subway would be led from the south to Spandau city hall. This plan crystallized very late, as the 200-kilometer plan envisaged to lead the U7 over Falkenseer Platz into Falkenhagener Feld. This resulted in the disadvantage that the Spandau old town could not have been connected, which was the actual goal of the extension. Finally, they decided on a variant to continue the route along the Nonnendammallee or the street Am Juliusturm, south past the Spandau Citadel and then directly to the old town and on to the Spandau town hall. The development of the Falkenhagener field should now be taken over by the extension of the small profile route of the line U2 of Ruhleben. On 1 October 1984, the last section of the U7 from Rohrdamm to [[Rathaus Spandau (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rathaus Spandau]] was opened, with the then [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor of Germany]], [[Helmut Kohl]], in attendance.\n\n==Future plans==\nIn 2014, the Berlin city government published the Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plan, of which the long-postponed northern extension of the U7 to Staaken is expected to begin construction in 2021 and be completed in 2025.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A southern extension from Rudow to [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] via Neuhofer Stra\u00dfe, Lieselotte-Berger-Stra\u00dfe, Sch\u00f6nefeld has already been shelved as the expected patronage was not high enough to justify such an expansion. However, in light of the ballot measure aimed at keeping  [[Tegel Airport]] open after the opening of the new [[Berlin Brandenburg International Airport]] governing mayor Michael M\u00fcller suggested an extension of U7 towards Sch\u00f6nefeld and/or the new airport which was greeted with enthusiasm by local politicians in Sch\u00f6nefeld and the Berlin district of Neuk\u00f6lln.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/u7-und-u8-in-berlin-senat-prueft-u-bahn-ausbau-zum-ber-und-ins-maerkische-viertel/20007154.html| title=Senat pr\u00fcft U-Bahn-Ausbau zum BER und ins M\u00e4rkische Viertel| website=Der Tagesspiegel| date=1 July 2017| language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/ubahnlinie-7-ber-senat-beraet-verlaengerung| title=Wird die U7 jetzt doch bis zum BER verl\u00e4ngert?| language=de| website=BZ| date=30 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rbb24.de/politik/Flughafen-BER/BER-Aktuelles/akteure_aktuell/2018/02/buergermeister-fuer-u7-verlaengerung-nach-schoenefeld.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703032249/https://www.rbb24.de/politik/Flughafen-BER/BER-Aktuelles/akteure_aktuell/2018/02/buergermeister-fuer-u7-verlaengerung-nach-schoenefeld.html| archivedate=3 July 2018| title=B\u00fcrgermeister fordern U7-Verl\u00e4ngerung nach Sch\u00f6nefeld| language=de| date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Line colour and name==\nIn 1966, the branched C line had a violet map colour. After it was separated from the rest of the line and line names were changed from letters to numbers, this route was called {{lang|de|\"Linie 7\"}} ({{lang-en|Line 7}}), and was represented by a grey line. After 1978, however, it was changed to a bright blue, because it is more easily discerned on the map. Since 1984, when all the underground lines received a \"U\" prefix, it has been called \"U7\".

Gusev]], [[Alexander Yegorov (soldier)|A. I. Yegorov]] and [[Kliment Voroshilov|K. E. Voroshilov]] in 1921.]]\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the ruling communist [[Bolsheviks]], in the fashion of most traditional [[Marxists]], hoped to disband the standing [[Imperial Russian Army]] of the deposed [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] and replace it with a militia system. The outbreak of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] led them to opt for a regular military in 1918 and they created the [[Red Army]] to oppose the anti-revolutionary [[White movement]].{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} The pre-existing army had a 250,000-strong officer corps. Of these, 75,000 were inducted into the Red Army, most of them being drafted and many not supportive of the Bolsheviks' political agenda. However, a large number joined out of a desire to maintain Russian territorial integrity (they believed that only the Bolsheviks could govern effectively) and to curb foreign influence in the country (the White leadership had promised foreign governments special privileges under their rule in exchange for support).{{sfn|Kokoshin|1998|p=13}} As such, the overwhelming majority of the officers in the Red Army had formerly served in the Imperial military, much to the chagrin of Bolshevik leaders who were anxious to assert their authority over the armed forces. They were forced to rely on the ex-Tsarist officers, dubbed \"military specialists\", due to a deficit of trained commanders among the revolutionaries. Throughout the war the Red Army's command staff, the [[Stavka]], was dominated by Tsarist officers.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} In spite of his colleagues' wariness, [[Vladimir Lenin]] praised them for their contributions to the Bolshevik war effort:{{sfn|Kokoshin|1998|p=13}}\n<blockquote>\n\"You have heard about the series of the brilliant victories won by the Red Army. There are tens of thousands of old colonels and other officers in its ranks. If we had not taken them into service and them work for us, we could not have created the Army...only with their help was the Red Army able to win the victories that it did.\"\n</blockquote>\nImmediately following the conflict the former Tsarists made up the majority of the General Staff Academy's faculty and constituted over 90 percent of all instructional and administrative staff at military schools. The Stavka was organised in a manner very similar to its Tsarist antecedent and much of the military curriculum was copied from the Imperial General Staff Academy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}}\n\nThe Bolsheviks reformed the Red Army in the mid-1920s. In an attempt to reduce the reliance on the mistrusted ex-Tsarists they reduced the officer corps and educated new cadets.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} [[Leon Trotsky]]'s removal from the Commissariat of Defence was in part driven by his perceived over-reliance on Tsarist officers. His replacement, [[Mikhail Frunze]], further decreased their number in army. By 1930, ex-Tsarists made up only about 10 percent of the officer corps.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=141}}\n\n==Generals==\n*'''[[Vasili Altfater]]''' - [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Imperial Navy]], joined the Bolsheviks from the beginning of the [[October Revolution]], became first [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Soviet Navy]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S1VimlFIjQoC&lpg=PA7&dq=vasili%20altfater&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false Admirals of the world]</ref>\n*'''[[Leonid Artamonov]]''' - General, military engineer and explorer of [[Africa]].

Gusev]], [[Alexander Yegorov (soldier)|A. I. Yegorov]] and [[Kliment Voroshilov|K. E. Voroshilov]] in 1921.]]\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the ruling communist [[Bolsheviks]], in the fashion of most traditional [[Marxists]], hoped to disband the standing [[Imperial Russian Army]] of the deposed [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] and replace it with a militia system. The outbreak of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] led them to opt for a regular military in 1918 and they created the [[Red Army]] to oppose the anti-revolutionary [[White movement]].{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} The pre-existing army had a 250,000-strong officer corps. Of these, 75,000 were inducted into the Red Army, most of them being drafted and many not supportive of the Bolsheviks' political agenda. However, a large number joined out of a desire to maintain Russian territorial integrity (they believed that only the Bolsheviks could govern effectively) and to curb foreign influence in the country (the White leadership had promised foreign governments special privileges under their rule in exchange for support).{{sfn|Kokoshin|1998|p=13}} As such, the overwhelming majority of the officers in the Red Army had formerly served in the Imperial military, much to the chagrin of Bolshevik leaders who were anxious to assert their authority over the armed forces. They were forced to rely on the ex-Tsarist officers, dubbed \"military specialists\", due to a deficit of trained commanders among the revolutionaries. Throughout the war the Red Army's command staff, the [[Stavka]], was dominated by Tsarist officers.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} In spite of his colleagues' wariness, [[Vladimir Lenin]] praised them for their contributions to the Bolshevik war effort:{{sfn|Kokoshin|1998|p=13}}\n<blockquote>\n\"You have heard about the series of the brilliant victories won by the Red Army. There are tens of thousands of old colonels and other officers in its ranks. If we had not taken them into service and them work for us, we could not have created the Army...only with their help was the Red Army able to win the victories that it did.\"\n</blockquote>\nImmediately following the conflict the former Tsarists made up the majority of the General Staff Academy's faculty and constituted over 90 percent of all instructional and administrative staff at military schools. The Stavka was organised in a manner very similar to its Tsarist antecedent and much of the military curriculum was copied from the Imperial General Staff Academy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}}\n\nThe Bolsheviks reformed the Red Army in the mid-1920s. In an attempt to reduce the reliance on the mistrusted ex-Tsarists they reduced the officer corps and educated new cadets.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=140}} [[Leon Trotsky]]'s removal from the Commissariat of Defence was in part driven by his perceived over-reliance on Tsarist officers. His replacement, [[Mikhail Frunze]], further decreased their number in army. By 1930, ex-Tsarists made up only about 10 percent of the officer corps.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=141}}\n\n==Generals==\n*'''[[Vasili Altfater]]''' - [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Imperial Navy]], joined the Bolsheviks from the beginning of the [[October Revolution]], became first [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Soviet Navy]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S1VimlFIjQoC&lpg=PA7&dq=vasili%20altfater&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false Admirals of the world]</ref>\n*'''[[Leonid Artamonov]]''' - General, military engineer and explorer of [[Africa]].

By the time a copy to a destination computer of each of those parts completes, a copy to another destination computer of that part (or other parts) is already taking place between users.]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File:BitTorrent network.svg|thumb|right|The middle computer is acting as a \"seed\" to provide a file to the other computers which act as peers.]]\nThe BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact of distributing large files. Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a \"swarm\" of hosts to upload to/download from each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over networks with lower [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in [[internet traffic]] in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nThe first release of the Bittorrent client had no search engine and no peer exchange, so users who wanted to upload a file had to create a small ''torrent'' descriptor file that they would upload to a torrent index site.  The first uploader acted as a ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Seed|seed]]'', and downloaders would initially connect as ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Peer|peers]]'' (see diagram on the right).  Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent which their client would use to connect to tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm.  Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed.\n\nThe file being distributed is divided into [[Segmented file transfer|segments]] called ''pieces''. As each peer receives a new piece of the file, it becomes a source (of that piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy. With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy of the file itself, and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of peers. Each piece is protected by a [[cryptographic hash]] contained in the torrent descriptor.<ref name=\"Protocol1.0\"/> This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications of any of the pieces received at other nodes. If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.\n\nPieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially, and are rearranged into the correct order by the BitTorrent client, which monitors which pieces it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers. Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example a 10&nbsp;MB file may be transmitted as ten 1&nbsp;MB pieces or as forty 256&nbsp;KB pieces).\nDue to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful in the transfer of larger files. This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces the overall time of the download.  This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall \"health\" of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in its complete form).\n\nThe distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a [[Flooding algorithm|flood-like]] spreading of a file throughout many peer computer nodes. As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a successful download by any particular node increases. Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significant reduction in the original distributor's hardware and bandwidth resource costs. [[Segmented downloading|Distributed downloading protocols]] in general provide [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] against system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor,<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1004.0395|title=Estimating Self-Sustainability in Peer-to-Peer Swarming Systems |journal=Performance Evaluation |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=1243\u20131258 |last1= Menasche |first1=Daniel S. |last2= Rocha |first2=Antonio A.

Up until 2005, the only way to share files was by creating a small text file called a \"[[Torrent file|torrent]]\". These files contain [[metadata]] about the files to be shared and the [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] which keep track of the other seeds and peers.  Users that want to download the file first obtain a torrent file for it, and connect to the tracker or seeds.  In 2005, first [[Vuze]] and then the Bittorrent client introduced distributed tracking using distributed hash tables which allowed clients to exchange data on swarms directly without the need for a torrent file.  In 2006, peer exchange functionality was added allowing clients to add peers based on the data found on connected nodes.\n\nThough both ultimately transfer files over a network, a BitTorrent download differs from a one way server-client download (as is typical with an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] request, for example) in several fundamental ways:\n* BitTorrent makes many small data requests over different [[Internet Protocol|IP]] connections to different machines, while server-client downloading is typically made via a single [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection to a single machine.\n* BitTorrent downloads in a random or in a \"rarest-first\"<ref name=\"Rarest First and Choke Algorithms Are Enough\">{{cite web | url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf | title=Rarest First and Choke Algorithms Are Enough | date=December 2006 | last=Urvoy-Keller | publisher=SIGCOMM | accessdate=9 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523055500/http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf | archive-date=23 May 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> approach that ensures high availability, while classic downloads are sequential.\n\nTaken together, these differences allow BitTorrent to achieve much lower cost to the content provider, much higher redundancy, and much greater resistance to abuse or to \"[[Slashdot effect|flash crowds]]\" than regular [[Server (computing)|server software]]. However, this protection, theoretically, comes at a cost: downloads can take time to rise to full speed because it may take time for enough peer connections to be established, and it may take time for a node to receive sufficient data to become an effective uploader. This contrasts with regular downloads (such as from an HTTP server, for example) that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, rise to full speed very quickly, and maintain this speed throughout. In the beginning, BitTorrent's non-contiguous download methods made it harder to support \"streaming playback\". However, recently{{as of?|date=April 2020}} more and more clients are offering streaming options.\n\n===Search queries===\nThe BitTorrent protocol provides no way to index torrent files. As a result, a comparatively small number of websites have hosted a large majority of torrents, many linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders, rendering those sites especially vulnerable to lawsuits.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/| title=PublicBT Tracker Set To Patch BitTorrent' Achilles' Heel| date=12 July 2009| publisher=Torrentfreak |author=Ernesto |accessdate=14 July 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326093356/http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/ | archivedate = 26 March 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> A BitTorrent index is a \"list of [[Torrent file|.torrent files]], which typically includes descriptions\" and information about the torrent's content.<ref>Chwan-Hwa (John) Wu, J. David Irwin. ''Introduction to Computer Networks and Cybersecurity''. Chapter 5.4.: Partially Centralized Architectures. [[CRC Press]]. February 4, 2013. {{ISBN|9781466572133}}</ref> Several types of websites support the discovery and distribution of data on the BitTorrent network. Public torrent-hosting sites such as [[The Pirate Bay]] allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files. Users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute. Often, these sites also run [[BitTorrent tracker]]s for their hosted torrent files, but these two functions are not mutually dependent: a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another unrelated site. Private host/tracker sites operate like public ones except that they may restrict access to registered users and may also keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce \"[[leech (computing)|leeching]]\".\n\n[[Web search engine]]s allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include [[The Pirate Bay]], [[Torrentz]], [[isoHunt]] and [[BTDigg]]. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria. This list can often be sorted with respect to several criteria, relevance (seeders-leechers ratio) being one of the most popular and useful (due to the way the protocol behaves, the download bandwidth achievable is very sensitive to this value). [[Metasearch engine]]s allow one to search several BitTorrent indices and search engines at once.\n\nThe [[Tribler]] BitTorrent client was among the first to incorporate built-in search capabilities.  With Tribler, users can find .torrent files held by random peers and taste buddies.<ref>Zeilemaker, N., Capot\u0103, M., Bakker, A., & Pouwelse, J. (2011). \"Tribler P2P Media Search and Sharing.\" Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Multimedia - MM \u201911.</ref> It adds such an ability to the BitTorrent protocol using a [[gossip protocol]], somewhat similar to the [[eXeem]] network which was shut down in 2005. The software includes the ability to recommend content as well.

Bitcomet.com. |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> feature. Whenever two peers using BitComet (with Torrent Exchange enabled) connect to each other they exchange lists of all the torrents (name and info-hash) they have in the Torrent Share storage (torrent files which were previously downloaded and for which the user chose to enable sharing by Torrent Exchange). Thus each client builds up a list of all the torrents shared by the peers it connected to in the current session (or it can even maintain the list between sessions if instructed).\n\nAt any time the user can search into that Torrent Collection list for a certain torrent and sort the list by categories. When the user chooses to download a torrent from that list, the .torrent file is automatically searched for (by info-hash value) in the [[Distributed hash table|DHT Network]] and when found it is downloaded by the querying client which can after that create and initiate a downloading task.\n\n===Downloading torrents and sharing files===\nUsers find a torrent of interest on a torrent index site or by using a search engine built into the client, download it, and open it with a BitTorrent client. The client connects to the tracker(s) or seeds specified in the torrent file, from which it receives a list of seeds and peers currently transferring pieces of the file(s). The client connects to those peers to obtain the various pieces. If the swarm contains only the initial seeder, the client connects directly to it, and begins to request pieces. Clients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates.\n\nThe effectiveness of this data exchange depends largely on the policies that clients use to determine to whom to send data. Clients may prefer to send data to peers that send data back to them (a \"[[tit for tat]]\" exchange scheme), which encourages fair trading. But strict policies often result in suboptimal situations, such as when newly joined peers are unable to receive any data because they don't have any pieces yet to trade themselves or when two peers with a good connection between them do not exchange data simply because neither of them takes the initiative. To counter these effects, the official BitTorrent client program uses a mechanism called \"optimistic unchoking\", whereby the client reserves a portion of its available [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for sending pieces to random peers (not necessarily known good partners, so called preferred peers) in hopes of discovering even better partners and to ensure that newcomers get a chance to join the swarm.<ref name = \"Tamilmanistudy\" >{{cite web| url=http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |title=Studying and enhancing the BitTorrent protocol |first=Karthik |last=Tamilmani |publisher=Stony Brook University |date=25 October 2003 |accessdate=6 May 2006 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119150847/http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |archivedate=19 November 2004}}</ref><!-- mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu down, subst archive.org link -->\n\nAlthough \"swarming\" scales well to tolerate \"flash crowds\" for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular or [[niche market]] content. Peers arriving after the initial rush might find the content unavailable and need to wait for the arrival of a \"seed\" in order to complete their downloads. The seed arrival, in turn, may take long to happen (this is termed the \"seeder promotion problem\"). Since maintaining seeds for unpopular content entails high bandwidth and administrative costs, this runs counter to the goals of publishers that value BitTorrent as a cheap alternative to a client-server approach. This occurs on a huge scale; measurements have shown that 38% of all new torrents become unavailable within the first month.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=0912.0625 |title=Unraveling BitTorrent's File Unavailability: Measurements and Analysis |last=Kaune |first=Sebastian |display-authors=etal |class=cs.NI |year=2009 }}</ref> A strategy adopted by many publishers which significantly increases availability of unpopular content consists of bundling multiple files in a single swarm.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Menasche.pdf |title=Content Availability and Bundling in Swarming Systems |author=D.

The peer creates a [[Hash Function|hash]] for each piece, using the [[SHA-1]] hash function, and records it in the torrent file. Pieces with sizes greater than 512&nbsp;kB will reduce the size of a torrent file for a very large payload, but is claimed to reduce the efficiency of the protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification |title=BitTorrent Specification |publisher=Wiki.theory.org |accessdate=9 July 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626195027/https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification | archivedate = 26 June 2013| url-status=live}}{{dubious|reason=Wikis are not citable sources \u2013 find a better source-Lexein|date=April 2013}}</ref> When another peer later receives a particular piece, the hash of the piece is compared to the recorded hash to test that the piece is error-free.<ref name = \"Protocol1.0\" /> Peers that provide a complete file are called seeders, and the peer providing the initial copy is called the initial seeder. The exact information contained in the torrent file depends on the version of the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nBy convention, the name of a torrent file has the suffix <code>.torrent</code>. Torrent files have an \"announce\" section, which specifies the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the tracker, and an \"info\" section, containing (suggested) names for the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a [[SHA-1]] [[hash code]] for each piece, all of which are used by clients to verify the integrity of the data they receive. Though SHA-1 has shown signs of cryptographic weakness, Bram Cohen did not initially consider the risk big enough for a backward incompatible change to, for example, [[SHA-3]]. BitTorrent is now preparing to move to SHA-256.\n\nIn the early days, torrent files were typically published to torrent index websites, and registered with at least one tracker. The tracker maintained lists of the clients currently connected to the swarm.<ref name=\"Protocol1.0\"/> Alternatively, in a ''trackerless system'' (decentralized tracking) every peer acts as a tracker.

One can usually see the [[IP address]]es of all peers in a swarm in one's own client or firewall program.  This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks.<ref name=\"Tamilmanistudy\" /> In some countries, copyright organizations scrape lists of peers, and send takedown notices to the [[internet service provider]] of users participating in the swarms of files that are under copyright.  In some jurisdictions, copyright holders may launch lawsuits against uploaders or downloaders for infringement, and police may arrest suspects in such cases.\n\nVarious means have been used to promote anonymity.  For example, the bittorrent client [[Tribler]] makes available a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]-like [[onion routing|onion network]], optionally routing transfers through other peers to obscure which client has requested the data.  The exit node would be visible to peers in a swarm, but the Tribler organization provides exit nodes.  One advantage of Tribler is that [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents can be downloaded with only a small decrease in download speed from one \"hop\" of routing.\n\n[[i2p]] provides a similar anonymity layer although in that case, one can only download torrents that have been uploaded to the i2p network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|title=I2P Compared to Tor - I2P|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222000747/https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The bittorrent client [[Vuze]] allows users who are not concerned about anonymity to take [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents, and make them available on the [[i2p]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|title=I2PHelper HowTo - VuzeWiki|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084042/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost bittorrent clients are not designed to provide anonymity when used over [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|title=Bittorrent over Tor isn't a good idea - The Tor Blog|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013120154/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and there is some debate as to whether torrenting over Tor acts as a drag on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|title=Tor Project: FAQ|first=The Tor Project|last=Inc.|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022004822/https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|archive-date=22 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nPrivate torrent trackers are usually invitation only, and require members to participate in uploading, but have the downside of a single centralized point of failure.

The following month, BitTorrent, Inc. released version 4.2.0 of the Mainline BitTorrent client, which supported an alternative DHT implementation (popularly known as \"[[Mainline DHT]]\", outlined in a draft on their website) that is incompatible with that of Azureus.

This idea is based on the distributed tracker approach and is used to describe some web resource. Currently, it is used for [[instant messaging]]. It is implemented using a special messaging protocol and requires an appropriate plugin. Anatomic P2P is another approach, which uses a decentralized network of nodes that route traffic to dynamic trackers. Most BitTorrent clients also use [[Peer exchange]] (PEX) to gather peers in addition to [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] and [[Distributed hash table|DHT]]. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.\n\n===Web seeding===\nWeb \"seeding\" was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the \"swarm\". The advantage of this feature is that a website may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify long-term seeding and [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] through the use of existing, cheap, web hosting setups.

Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a \"swarm\" of hosts to upload to/download from each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over networks with lower [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in [[internet traffic]] in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nThe first release of the Bittorrent client had no search engine and no peer exchange, so users who wanted to upload a file had to create a small ''torrent'' descriptor file that they would upload to a torrent index site.  The first uploader acted as a ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Seed|seed]]'', and downloaders would initially connect as ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Peer|peers]]'' (see diagram on the right).  Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent which their client would use to connect to tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm.  Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed.\n\nThe file being distributed is divided into [[Segmented file transfer|segments]] called ''pieces''. As each peer receives a new piece of the file, it becomes a source (of that piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy. With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy of the file itself, and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of peers. Each piece is protected by a [[cryptographic hash]] contained in the torrent descriptor.<ref name=\"Protocol1.0\"/> This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications of any of the pieces received at other nodes. If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.\n\nPieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially, and are rearranged into the correct order by the BitTorrent client, which monitors which pieces it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers. Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example a 10&nbsp;MB file may be transmitted as ten 1&nbsp;MB pieces or as forty 256&nbsp;KB pieces).\nDue to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful in the transfer of larger files. This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces the overall time of the download.  This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall \"health\" of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in its complete form).\n\nThe distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a [[Flooding algorithm|flood-like]] spreading of a file throughout many peer computer nodes. As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a successful download by any particular node increases. Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significant reduction in the original distributor's hardware and bandwidth resource costs. [[Segmented downloading|Distributed downloading protocols]] in general provide [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] against system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor,<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1004.0395|title=Estimating Self-Sustainability in Peer-to-Peer Swarming Systems |journal=Performance Evaluation |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=1243\u20131258 |last1= Menasche |first1=Daniel S. |last2= Rocha |first2=Antonio A.

Up until 2005, the only way to share files was by creating a small text file called a \"[[Torrent file|torrent]]\". These files contain [[metadata]] about the files to be shared and the [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] which keep track of the other seeds and peers.  Users that want to download the file first obtain a torrent file for it, and connect to the tracker or seeds.  In 2005, first [[Vuze]] and then the Bittorrent client introduced distributed tracking using distributed hash tables which allowed clients to exchange data on swarms directly without the need for a torrent file.  In 2006, peer exchange functionality was added allowing clients to add peers based on the data found on connected nodes.\n\nThough both ultimately transfer files over a network, a BitTorrent download differs from a one way server-client download (as is typical with an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] request, for example) in several fundamental ways:\n* BitTorrent makes many small data requests over different [[Internet Protocol|IP]] connections to different machines, while server-client downloading is typically made via a single [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection to a single machine.\n* BitTorrent downloads in a random or in a \"rarest-first\"<ref name=\"Rarest First and Choke Algorithms Are Enough\">{{cite web | url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf | title=Rarest First and Choke Algorithms Are Enough | date=December 2006 | last=Urvoy-Keller | publisher=SIGCOMM | accessdate=9 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523055500/http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2006/papers/p20-legout.pdf | archive-date=23 May 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> approach that ensures high availability, while classic downloads are sequential.\n\nTaken together, these differences allow BitTorrent to achieve much lower cost to the content provider, much higher redundancy, and much greater resistance to abuse or to \"[[Slashdot effect|flash crowds]]\" than regular [[Server (computing)|server software]]. However, this protection, theoretically, comes at a cost: downloads can take time to rise to full speed because it may take time for enough peer connections to be established, and it may take time for a node to receive sufficient data to become an effective uploader. This contrasts with regular downloads (such as from an HTTP server, for example) that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, rise to full speed very quickly, and maintain this speed throughout. In the beginning, BitTorrent's non-contiguous download methods made it harder to support \"streaming playback\". However, recently{{as of?|date=April 2020}} more and more clients are offering streaming options.\n\n===Search queries===\nThe BitTorrent protocol provides no way to index torrent files. As a result, a comparatively small number of websites have hosted a large majority of torrents, many linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders, rendering those sites especially vulnerable to lawsuits.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/| title=PublicBT Tracker Set To Patch BitTorrent' Achilles' Heel| date=12 July 2009| publisher=Torrentfreak |author=Ernesto |accessdate=14 July 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326093356/http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/ | archivedate = 26 March 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> A BitTorrent index is a \"list of [[Torrent file|.torrent files]], which typically includes descriptions\" and information about the torrent's content.<ref>Chwan-Hwa (John) Wu, J. David Irwin. ''Introduction to Computer Networks and Cybersecurity''. Chapter 5.4.: Partially Centralized Architectures. [[CRC Press]]. February 4, 2013. {{ISBN|9781466572133}}</ref> Several types of websites support the discovery and distribution of data on the BitTorrent network. Public torrent-hosting sites such as [[The Pirate Bay]] allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files. Users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute. Often, these sites also run [[BitTorrent tracker]]s for their hosted torrent files, but these two functions are not mutually dependent: a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another unrelated site. Private host/tracker sites operate like public ones except that they may restrict access to registered users and may also keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce \"[[leech (computing)|leeching]]\".\n\n[[Web search engine]]s allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include [[The Pirate Bay]], [[Torrentz]], [[isoHunt]] and [[BTDigg]]. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria. This list can often be sorted with respect to several criteria, relevance (seeders-leechers ratio) being one of the most popular and useful (due to the way the protocol behaves, the download bandwidth achievable is very sensitive to this value). [[Metasearch engine]]s allow one to search several BitTorrent indices and search engines at once.\n\nThe [[Tribler]] BitTorrent client was among the first to incorporate built-in search capabilities.  With Tribler, users can find .torrent files held by random peers and taste buddies.<ref>Zeilemaker, N., Capot\u0103, M., Bakker, A., & Pouwelse, J.

Whenever two peers using BitComet (with Torrent Exchange enabled) connect to each other they exchange lists of all the torrents (name and info-hash) they have in the Torrent Share storage (torrent files which were previously downloaded and for which the user chose to enable sharing by Torrent Exchange). Thus each client builds up a list of all the torrents shared by the peers it connected to in the current session (or it can even maintain the list between sessions if instructed).\n\nAt any time the user can search into that Torrent Collection list for a certain torrent and sort the list by categories. When the user chooses to download a torrent from that list, the .torrent file is automatically searched for (by info-hash value) in the [[Distributed hash table|DHT Network]] and when found it is downloaded by the querying client which can after that create and initiate a downloading task.\n\n===Downloading torrents and sharing files===\nUsers find a torrent of interest on a torrent index site or by using a search engine built into the client, download it, and open it with a BitTorrent client. The client connects to the tracker(s) or seeds specified in the torrent file, from which it receives a list of seeds and peers currently transferring pieces of the file(s). The client connects to those peers to obtain the various pieces. If the swarm contains only the initial seeder, the client connects directly to it, and begins to request pieces. Clients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates.\n\nThe effectiveness of this data exchange depends largely on the policies that clients use to determine to whom to send data. Clients may prefer to send data to peers that send data back to them (a \"[[tit for tat]]\" exchange scheme), which encourages fair trading. But strict policies often result in suboptimal situations, such as when newly joined peers are unable to receive any data because they don't have any pieces yet to trade themselves or when two peers with a good connection between them do not exchange data simply because neither of them takes the initiative. To counter these effects, the official BitTorrent client program uses a mechanism called \"optimistic unchoking\", whereby the client reserves a portion of its available [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for sending pieces to random peers (not necessarily known good partners, so called preferred peers) in hopes of discovering even better partners and to ensure that newcomers get a chance to join the swarm.<ref name = \"Tamilmanistudy\" >{{cite web| url=http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |title=Studying and enhancing the BitTorrent protocol |first=Karthik |last=Tamilmani |publisher=Stony Brook University |date=25 October 2003 |accessdate=6 May 2006 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119150847/http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |archivedate=19 November 2004}}</ref><!-- mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu down, subst archive.org link -->\n\nAlthough \"swarming\" scales well to tolerate \"flash crowds\" for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular or [[niche market]] content. Peers arriving after the initial rush might find the content unavailable and need to wait for the arrival of a \"seed\" in order to complete their downloads. The seed arrival, in turn, may take long to happen (this is termed the \"seeder promotion problem\"). Since maintaining seeds for unpopular content entails high bandwidth and administrative costs, this runs counter to the goals of publishers that value BitTorrent as a cheap alternative to a client-server approach. This occurs on a huge scale; measurements have shown that 38% of all new torrents become unavailable within the first month.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=0912.0625 |title=Unraveling BitTorrent's File Unavailability: Measurements and Analysis |last=Kaune |first=Sebastian |display-authors=etal |class=cs.NI |year=2009 }}</ref> A strategy adopted by many publishers which significantly increases availability of unpopular content consists of bundling multiple files in a single swarm.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Menasche.pdf |title=Content Availability and Bundling in Swarming Systems |author=D.

The peer creates a [[Hash Function|hash]] for each piece, using the [[SHA-1]] hash function, and records it in the torrent file. Pieces with sizes greater than 512&nbsp;kB will reduce the size of a torrent file for a very large payload, but is claimed to reduce the efficiency of the protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification |title=BitTorrent Specification |publisher=Wiki.theory.org |accessdate=9 July 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626195027/https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification | archivedate = 26 June 2013| url-status=live}}{{dubious|reason=Wikis are not citable sources \u2013 find a better source-Lexein|date=April 2013}}</ref> When another peer later receives a particular piece, the hash of the piece is compared to the recorded hash to test that the piece is error-free.<ref name = \"Protocol1.0\" /> Peers that provide a complete file are called seeders, and the peer providing the initial copy is called the initial seeder. The exact information contained in the torrent file depends on the version of the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nBy convention, the name of a torrent file has the suffix <code>.torrent</code>. Torrent files have an \"announce\" section, which specifies the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the tracker, and an \"info\" section, containing (suggested) names for the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a [[SHA-1]] [[hash code]] for each piece, all of which are used by clients to verify the integrity of the data they receive. Though SHA-1 has shown signs of cryptographic weakness, Bram Cohen did not initially consider the risk big enough for a backward incompatible change to, for example, [[SHA-3]]. BitTorrent is now preparing to move to SHA-256.\n\nIn the early days, torrent files were typically published to torrent index websites, and registered with at least one tracker. The tracker maintained lists of the clients currently connected to the swarm.<ref name=\"Protocol1.0\"/> Alternatively, in a ''trackerless system'' (decentralized tracking) every peer acts as a tracker.

One can usually see the [[IP address]]es of all peers in a swarm in one's own client or firewall program.  This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks.<ref name=\"Tamilmanistudy\" /> In some countries, copyright organizations scrape lists of peers, and send takedown notices to the [[internet service provider]] of users participating in the swarms of files that are under copyright.  In some jurisdictions, copyright holders may launch lawsuits against uploaders or downloaders for infringement, and police may arrest suspects in such cases.\n\nVarious means have been used to promote anonymity.  For example, the bittorrent client [[Tribler]] makes available a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]-like [[onion routing|onion network]], optionally routing transfers through other peers to obscure which client has requested the data.  The exit node would be visible to peers in a swarm, but the Tribler organization provides exit nodes.  One advantage of Tribler is that [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents can be downloaded with only a small decrease in download speed from one \"hop\" of routing.\n\n[[i2p]] provides a similar anonymity layer although in that case, one can only download torrents that have been uploaded to the i2p network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|title=I2P Compared to Tor - I2P|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222000747/https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The bittorrent client [[Vuze]] allows users who are not concerned about anonymity to take [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents, and make them available on the [[i2p]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|title=I2PHelper HowTo - VuzeWiki|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084042/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost bittorrent clients are not designed to provide anonymity when used over [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|title=Bittorrent over Tor isn't a good idea - The Tor Blog|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013120154/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and there is some debate as to whether torrenting over Tor acts as a drag on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|title=Tor Project: FAQ|first=The Tor Project|last=Inc.|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022004822/https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|archive-date=22 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nPrivate torrent trackers are usually invitation only, and require members to participate in uploading, but have the downside of a single centralized point of failure.

The following month, BitTorrent, Inc. released version 4.2.0 of the Mainline BitTorrent client, which supported an alternative DHT implementation (popularly known as \"[[Mainline DHT]]\", outlined in a draft on their website) that is incompatible with that of Azureus.

This idea is based on the distributed tracker approach and is used to describe some web resource. Currently, it is used for [[instant messaging]]. It is implemented using a special messaging protocol and requires an appropriate plugin. Anatomic P2P is another approach, which uses a decentralized network of nodes that route traffic to dynamic trackers. Most BitTorrent clients also use [[Peer exchange]] (PEX) to gather peers in addition to [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] and [[Distributed hash table|DHT]]. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.\n\n===Web seeding===\nWeb \"seeding\" was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the \"swarm\". The advantage of this feature is that a website may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify long-term seeding and [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] through the use of existing, cheap, web hosting setups. In theory, this would make using BitTorrent almost as easy for a web publisher as creating a direct HTTP download. In addition, it would allow the \"web seed\" to be disabled if the swarm becomes too popular while still allowing the file to be readily available. This feature has two distinct specifications, both of which are supported by [[Libtorrent]] and the 26+ clients that use it.\n\n====Hash web seeding====\nThe first was created by John \"TheSHAD0W\" Hoffman, who created [[BitTornado]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt |title=HTTP-Based Seeding Specification |format=TXT |publisher=BitTornado.com |accessdate=9 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040320142756/http://www.bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt |archivedate=20 March 2004 |url-status=dead|df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html|title=''HTTP Seeding'' \u2013 BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal \u2116 17|author=John Hoffman, DeHackEd|date=25 February 2008|website=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213074432/http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html|archivedate=13 December 2013|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> This first specification requires running a web service that serves content by info-hash and piece number, rather than filename.\n\n====HTTP web seeding====\nThe other specification is created by [[GetRight]] authors and can rely on a basic HTTP download space (using [[byte serving]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getright.com/seedtorrent.html|title=HTTP/FTP Seeding for BitTorrent |publisher=GetRight.com|accessdate=18 March 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228072458/http://getright.com/seedtorrent.html |archivedate = 28 December 2009| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html|title=''WebSeed \u2013 HTTP/FTP Seeding (GetRight style)'' \u2013 BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal \u2116 19|author=Michael Burford|date=25 February 2008|website=|publisher=Bittorrent.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213074337/http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html|archivedate=13 December 2013|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Other====\nIn September 2010, a new service named [[Burnbit]] was launched which generates a torrent from any URL using webseeding.<ref name=\"tf-article\">{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/burn-any-web-hosted-file-into-a-torrent-with-burnbit-100913/|title=Burn Any Web-Hosted File into a Torrent With Burnbit|last=|first=|date=13 September 2010|website=|publisher=TorrentFreak|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809053857/http://torrentfreak.com/burn-any-web-hosted-file-into-a-torrent-with-burnbit-100913/|archivedate=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> There are server-side solutions that provide initial seeding of the file from the web server via standard BitTorrent protocol and when the number of external seeders reach a limit, they stop serving the file from the original source.<ref name=\"web-seeders\">{{cite web|url=http://php-tracker.org/ |title=PHP based torrent file creator, tracker and seed server |publisher=PHPTracker |accessdate=9 July 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131219084439/http://php-tracker.org/ | archivedate = 19 December 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===RSS feeds===\n{{Main|Broadcatching}}\n\nA technique called [[broadcatching]] combines [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds with the BitTorrent protocol to create a content delivery system, further simplifying and automating content distribution.

SET, proposed by researchers Pucha, Andersen, and Kaminsky, works by spotting chunks of identical data in files that are an exact or near match to the one needed and transferring these data to the client if the \"exact\" data are not present.

There has been much controversy over the use of BitTorrent trackers. BitTorrent metafiles themselves do not store file contents. Whether the publishers of BitTorrent metafiles violate copyrights by linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders is controversial. Various jurisdictions have pursued legal action against websites that host BitTorrent trackers.\n\nHigh-profile examples include the closing of [[Suprnova.org]], [[TorrentSpy]], [[LokiTorrent]], [[BTJunkie]], [[Mininova]], [[Oink's Pink Palace]] and [[What.cd]]. [[The Pirate Bay]] torrent website, formed by a Swedish group, is noted for the \"legal\" section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed.

By selecting larger chunks (i.e. >256kB) the amount of resources required to find SHA1 collision is tremendous, which makes the attack virtually impossible.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Anonymous P2P]]\n* [[Napster]]\n* [[Gnutella]]\n* [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]]\n* [[Bencode]]\n* [[Cache Discovery Protocol]]\n* [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]]\n* [[Comparison of BitTorrent sites]]\n* [[Comparison of BitTorrent tracker software]]\n* [[FastTrack]]\n* [[Glossary of BitTorrent terms]]\n* [[Magnet URI scheme]]\n* [[Micro Transport Protocol|\u03bcTP (Micro Transport Protocol)]]\n* [[Peer-to-peer file sharing]]\n* [[Segmented file transfer]]\n* [[Simple file verification]]\n* [[Super-seeding]]\n* [[Torrent file]]\n* [[Torrent poisoning]]\n* [[Virtual private network|VPN]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |chapter= The Bittorrent P2P File-Sharing System: Measurements and Analysis |title=Peer-to-Peer Systems IV |volume=3640 |last=Pouwelse |first=Johan |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-29068-1 |doi=10.1007/11558989_19 |pages=205\u2013216|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dnw7E8xzQUMC&lpg=PA205&dq=The%20Bittorrent%20P2P%20File-Sharing%20System%3A%20Measurements%20and%20Analysis%20Johan%20Pouwelse%20%2C%20Pawel%20Garbacki%2C%20Dick%20Epema%2C&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 September 2011|display-authors=etal|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|BitTorrent}}\n* {{official website|https://www.bittorrent.org/}}\n*[https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html Specification]\n* {{curlie|Computers/Internet/File_Sharing/BitTorrent|BitTorrent}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061230021548/http://streaming.scmp.com/podcasting/upload/News_BitTorrent_june15.mp3 Interview with chief executive Ashwin Navin]\n*[https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification Unofficial BitTorrent Protocol Specification v1.0] at wiki.theory.org\n*[https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrent_Location-aware_Protocol_1.0_Specification Unofficial BitTorrent Location-aware Protocol 1.0 Specification] at wiki.theory.org\n* {{cite journal |first= Michal |last= Czerniawski |ssrn= 1540913 |title= Responsibility of Bittorrent Search Engines for Copyright Infringements |publisher= [[SSRN]] |date= 20 December 2009 |doi= 10.2139/ssrn.1540913}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/050216.html|title=Under the hood of BitTorrent|first=Bram|last=Cohen|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|date=16 February 2005|work=Computer Systems Colloquium (EE380)}}\n\n{{Cloud computing}}\n{{BitTorrent}}\n{{File sharing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bittorrent (Protocol)}}\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2001]]\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:BitTorrent| ]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0]]\n[[Category:File sharing]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"}
