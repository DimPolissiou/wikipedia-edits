({{Literal translation|Extravagant!}}) is a [[Philippine television]] [[variety show]] broadcast by [[GMA Iloilo]] and [[GMA Bacolod]].<ref>https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2006/08/14/352784/smooth-silk-takeover/amp/</ref> Hosted by Jigo Mambo, John Arceo, Leez Quimpo, Em Capalla and Joan Jalandoni, it premiered on October 1999. The show concluded on September 2, 2007.\n\nThe show was popular for its segments '''\"Pok Gi Pok\"''', a gay boxing challenge where two gay contestants battle it out using oversized hand gloves; and '''\"Bongga Babes\"''', a bikini-open contest featuring the sexiest babes in Western Visayas.  It also featured some of the hottest Ilonggo bands and dance groups in Western Visayas, with the special participation of some of the most popular '''GMA Kapuso stars''' flown in from Manila every now and then to join the \"Bongga!\" gang.  Because of the show's own brand of fun and vibrant entertainment rarely seen in other local variety shows in Visayas and Mindanao, \"Bongga\" has earned the tag \"'''Pinasahi sa Tanan'''\" (Different among others).\n\n==Early years==\nLaunched in October 1999, \"Bongga\"'s format was musical variety.  Its shows were previously taped-as-live alternately from [[SM City Iloilo]] and [[Robinsons Place Bacolod]].  The original hosts were '''Hector Gloria''', '''Lara Alba''', '''Debbie Pelor''' and '''Ansab Urpiana''', with [[DYMK-FM|93.5 Campus Radio (now Barangay 93.5)]] DJs '''Jigo Mambo''' and '''Billy d' Kid''' acting as on-air video jocks (VJs).   However, after the show's first season, \"Bongga\" was reformatted as a gay-oriented variety program, with Jigo Mambo and Billy d' Kid joining Hector as main hosts.  It started dishing out portions like \"''Palarong Pambakla''\", \"''Pok Gi Pok''\" and \"''Binibining Bonggay''\" that generated a lot of controversy among the conservative groups in Western Visayas.  Despite the criticism, \"Bongga\" got high ratings basing on these segments alone and it helped them overcome the more established \"'''Barkadahan sa S na S'''\" of ABS-CBN TV 4 Bacolod.\n\n==\"Kalingawan sg Masa\" (Entertainment of the Masses/Aliwan para sa Masa) on tour==\nSoon after, \"Bongga\" began touring other places and campuses in the Philippines, conquering places like Cebu, Boracay, Sagay City, Guimbal, Miag-ao, Dumaguete, Davao and Baguio.  \"Bongga!\" also marks the distinction as the only musical variety show that aired live from a prison building, when they held a show at the Iloilo Rehabilitation Center in 2002.\n\n==The All-New \"Bongga!\"==\nIn October 2005, \"Bongga\" was relaunched with a new logo banner unveiled by two gay impersonators who jumped from the top of the Iloilo Business Hotel, the tallest structure in Iloilo City.  Prior to the relaunch, the show reformatted back to its original musical variety format in 2003, while retaining the gay-oriented portions it was famous for. Original host Jigo Mambo was joined by new hosts '''John Arceo''' (who came from \"Bongga\"'s defunct rival show '''\"Barkadahan sa S na S\"''' of [[DYXL-TV|ABS-CBN Bacolod]] and also a character actor), '''Gilbert \"Onal\" Golez''' (who was born in Iloilo and had a short stint in Manila as a singer), and Ilonggo talents '''Joan Jalandoni''', '''Apol Arro''' and '''Leez Quimpo'''.  The show also had a grand anniversary show held at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand with Kapuso stars Nadine Samonte, Ara Mina and Alfred Vargas as special guests.  Over 20,000 people witnessed the event.\n\n==The Biggest Local Variety Show in Western Visayas==\nIn August 2005, the show set a record in Western Visayas as the only local variety show that attracted more than 20,000 live audience when they taped an episode at SM City Iloilo featuring stars from \"Darna\" and \"Encantadia\" led by [[Angel Locsin]], [[Dennis Trillo]], [[Sunshine Dizon]], [[Karylle]] and [[Jennylyn Mercado]].  \"Bongga\" also served as a front-act for [[Eat Bulaga]] during the Grand Kapuso Fans Day held at the Iloilo Sports Complex in Iloilo City last September 17, 2005, performing before a record crowd of 60,000 people.  Among the stars that graced the Kapuso Fans Day Special were the [[SexBomb Girls]], [[Janice de Belen]], [[Gelli de Belen]], [[Carmina Villaroel]], [[Ogie Alcasid]] and [[German Moreno]].\n\nLast January 27, 2006, talents of \"Bongga\" hosted the GMA Kapuso Night at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand that featured some Kapuso stars from \"Etheria\", GMA KiliTV, and \"SOP\".  The event was attended by more than 30,000 people.\n\nOn April 2, 2006, [[24 Oras]] news anchor and TV host Mel Tiangco guested in \"Bongga!\" to promote the upcoming Easter Sunday episode of \"'''[[Mel and Joey]]'''\" where the entire show will feature the tourist spots and delicacies of Iloilo and Bacolod together with the ''[[StarStruck (Philippine TV series)|StarStruck]]'' Final 4 of Marky Cielo, Jackie Rice, Gian Carlos and Iwa Moto.  The particular episode was shown on Easter Sunday.\n\nOn April 29, 2006, \"Bongga!\" host Cherry Mae Barbo participated during the Aliwan Festival's Reyna ng Aliwan pageant as Iloilo's representative.  Barbo won 2nd runner-up despite not winning any special awards.\n\nOn August 5, 2006, \"Bongga!\" once again successfully staged a big show during the 2nd Grand Kapuso Fans Day held at the Iloilo Sports Complex Covered Gym in Iloilo City.  Over 10,000 people attended the event.  Among those who graced the show were Yasmien Kurdi, JC de Vera, Rhian Ramos, Iwa Moto, Gian Carlos, Antonio Aquitania and Ara Mina.\n\nIn October 2006, \"Bongga!\" was active on tour again as part of GMA's Kapuso Weekend Fever which featured big-named GMA Kapuso Stars touring Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu and Davao.  The show also celebrated its 7th anniversary on October 13, 2006 at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand, with Nadine Samonte, Marvin Agustin and Cueshe as guests.\n\nOn January 26, 2007, \"Bongga!\" once again staged a successful show at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand during GMA's Kapuso Night where GMA stars like Wendell Ramos, Maureen Larrazabal, Shamrock,  Francine Prieto, Nadine Samonte and Jennylyn Mercado performed before a huge crowd. On January 27, 2007, the show promoted the new telefantasya \"[[Super Twins]]'' and \"[[Lupin (Philippine TV series)|Lupin]]'' during the [[Dinagyang]] eve show at SM City.  During the summer season, \"Bongga!\" was able to cash in on GMA's nationwide \"Sumamer Ka Na\" campaign by bringing viewers to different festivals around the country like \"Aliwan Festival\" and \"Wow Villa\".\n\n==Reformat==\nOn the second week of July, the show underwent a major revamp as GMA Iloilo publicly announced auditions for new on-cam talents and will hire people to be part of their production staff.  Positions for TV director, writers and segment producers were also declared as open.  In the coming weeks, the show will introduce new segments and new hosts.  While the transition is on-going, Jigo Mambo, Leez Quimpo, Em Capalla and Angel are currently doing the hosting chores.  The fate of other hosts like John Arceo, Onal Golez and Joan Jalandoni are still being determined as of press time, although John and Joan has since returned to the show.\n\nLast July 26, 2007, \"Bongga!\" held a musical special entitled \"Kapuso Serbis-Yo! Live Bongga!\" (Service! Live Extravagant!) at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand.  Despite the intermittent weather, the show went on and showcased different local talents from the field of music and dance from different genres.  It was a total deviation from the usual fare that \"Bongga!\" offers every week to Ilonggo televiewers as the hosts talked less and gave the spotlight to local talents complemented with an explosive performance by [[Kamikazee]] band from Manila.  The new format of \"more production numbers, less talk\" was introduced on July 14, 2006 at Robinson's Place Iloilo.  \"Bongga\"'s new all musical variety format is meant to keep the show a notch higher than its competitors and be at par with the Manila variety shows.\n\nIn August 2007, \"Bongga!\" lost out to rival show \"[[Sabado Barkada]]\" of ABS-CBN 4 Bacolod in the ratings game based on the July ratings for Nielsen Media Research in Iloilo City.  Although both shows were airing on different days (Sabado Barkada airs on Saturdays), the comparative ratings showed that \"Sabado\" posted higher ratings.  \"Bongga!\" decided to bring back the parlor games it was known for, complete with elements of reality TV.\n\n==The Dinagyang Controversy==\nOn January 28, 2007 \"Bongga\" hosts Jigo Mambo and Joan Jalandoni joined forces with some talents of ABS-CBN to host the [[Dinagyang]] awarding ceremonies.  As part of the ceremonies, both ABS-CBN and GMA Network provided their talents to entertain the crowd while waiting for the results.  One character on the show, Josef Mary, enjoys the taste of his own pee.  The show was supposed to start at around 5 pm Philippine time.  However, because of some delays in the preparation, the Dinagyang Foundation organizers decided to start the program proper at 6 pm.  At the same time, the organizers gave 30 minutes each for both networks to provide entertainment.  GMA Network was allowed to go first, and brought in [[Gabby Eigenmann]] and [[Sunshine Dizon]] to perform.  Each talents were allowed to perform 2 songs.  Gabby was able to perform while Sunshine's performance was abruptly cut.\n\nVideo footages from GMA Iloilo's newscast \"Ratsada\" showed two instances that Sunshine Dizon's performance was sabotaged. The first came after Sunshine's first song, Jigo Mambo approached her for a short interview but their microphone audio went off and instead an audio from Sky Cable's talent came in.  The second incident came after Sunshine's supposed 2nd song when in the middle of her performance, a lady host from ABS-CBN came up the stage and hyped the crowd with the arrival of ABS-CBN talent Matt Evans of \"Pedro Penduko\" fame.  With her was \"Bongga\"'s Joan Jalandoni who was there to control the situation but her microphone went off.\n\nThe apparent sabotage earned the ire of Sunshine Dizon and her mother Dorothy Laforteza.  Also the management of [[DYAF-TV|ABS-CBN Iloilo]] was hands off after the incident, denying any involvement on their part.  The Dinagyang incident gave 15 minutes of nationwide fame for the two \"Bongga\" hosts Jigo and Joan, since the whole incident was aired over GMA's \"[[24 Oras]]\".  Joan was also among those interviewed about the incident together with Sunshine Dizon, Gabby Eigenmann and ABS-CBN Iloilo Station Manager Charie Ginete-Ilon.\n\n==Farewell Episode==\n\"Bongga!\" aired its farewell episode last September 2, 2007 without much fanfare.  Conspicuously, its main hosts Jigo Mambo and John Arceo were absent while female host Joan took hosting duties with 2 gay hosts.  At the closing credits, the message that read ''Madamo nga salamat, Kapuso! 1999-2007'' (Thank you very much Kapuso) was shown on the screen capped with the Kapuso logo.\n\n\"Bongga!\" went off the air at the height of its popularity, and it consistently retained its status as one of the premier top-rating local variety shows outside of Metro Manila.\n\n==Hosts==\n* Jigo Mambo\n* John Arceo\n* Leez Quimpo\n* Em Capalla\n* [[Angel Locsin]]\n* Joan Jalandoni\n\n;Former co-hosts\n* Hector Gloria (1999\u20132003)\n* Billy d' Kid (1999\u20132003)\n* Debbie Pelor (1999)\n* Ansab Urpiana (1999\u20132000)\n* Lara Alba (1999\u20132000)\n* Ruth (1999)\n* Tricia Aguirre (1999)\n* Sunshine Gregorio (2000)\n* Teresa Bacabac (2003\u20132004)\n* Candy Doronila (2000)\n* Varvin Hope Simon Hi\u00f1ola (2005\u20132006) - recurring\n* April Rose Arro (2003\u20132005; 2007)\n* Tuska Bianca Alivio (2003\u20132005)\n* Bonggastruck's  Ralph, Kara, Mark, Jhun Fil, Gladys, DT, Michael, Carlo (2005)\n* Charles Ea (2006)\n* Cherry May Barbo (2006\u20132007)\n* Kenneth Villanueva (2007)\n* Gilbert Onal Golez (2003\u20132007)\n* Carlo Quiat (2004\u20132006)\n\n;Guest co-hosts\n* [[KC Montero]]\n* [[Jake Cuenca]]\n* Gian Carlos\n* [[Luke Mijares]]\n* [[Sunshine Dizon]]\n* Tiya Pusit\n* [[Francine Prieto]]\n* [[Iwa Moto]]\n* [[Jolina Magdangal]]\n* [[Paolo Ballesteros]]\n* [[Arnel Ignacio]]\n\n==Directors==\n* Tricia Aguirre\n* Moonlight Lady\n* Elmo Benguan\n* Reggie Molina\n* Varvin Hope Simon Hi\u00f1ola\n\n==Accolades==\n* KBP Golden Dove Awardee- Best Provincial Variety Show (2001)\n* No. 1 Local Variety Show (Western Visayas) according to PSRC Survey (2000\u20132005)\n* Reyna ng Aliwan 2nd Runner Up Aliwan Festival- Bongga host Cherry May Barbo (2006)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:GMA Network shows]]\n[[Category:Philippine variety television shows]]\n[[Category:Television in Iloilo City]]\n[[Category:1999 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2007 Philippine television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Bongga!\n| genre                    = [[Variety show|Variety]]\n| runtime                  = 60 minutes\n| company                  = GMA Entertainment TV\n| presenter                = {{plain list|\n* Jigo Mambo\n* John Arceo\n* Leez Quimpo\n* Em Capalla\n* Joan Jalandoni}}\n| country                  = [[Philippines]]\n| language                 = [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]\n| camera                   = [[Multiple-camera setup]]\n| network                  = [[GMA Iloilo]]\n| picture_format           = [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n| first_aired              = {{start date|1999|10}}\n| last_aired               = {{end date|2007|9|2}}\n}}\n\n'''''Bongga!'''''

The new format of \"more production numbers, less talk\" was introduced on July 14, 2006 at Robinson's Place Iloilo.  \"Bongga\"'s new all musical variety format is meant to keep the show a notch higher than its competitors and be at par with the Manila variety shows.\n\nIn August 2007, \"Bongga!\" lost out to rival show \"[[Sabado Barkada]]\" of ABS-CBN 4 Bacolod in the ratings game based on the July ratings for Nielsen Media Research in Iloilo City.  Although both shows were airing on different days (Sabado Barkada airs on Saturdays), the comparative ratings showed that \"Sabado\" posted higher ratings.  \"Bongga!\" decided to bring back the parlor games it was known for, complete with elements of reality TV.\n\n==The Dinagyang Controversy==\nOn January 28, 2007 \"Bongga\" hosts Jigo Mambo and Joan Jalandoni joined forces with some talents of ABS-CBN to host the [[Dinagyang]] awarding ceremonies.  As part of the ceremonies, both ABS-CBN and GMA Network provided their talents to entertain the crowd while waiting for the results.  One character on the show, Josef Mary, enjoys the taste of his own pee.  The show was supposed to start at around 5 pm Philippine time.  However, because of some delays in the preparation, the Dinagyang Foundation organizers decided to start the program proper at 6 pm.  At the same time, the organizers gave 30 minutes each for both networks to provide entertainment.  GMA Network was allowed to go first, and brought in [[Gabby Eigenmann]] and [[Sunshine Dizon]] to perform.  Each talents were allowed to perform 2 songs.  Gabby was able to perform while Sunshine's performance was abruptly cut.\n\nVideo footages from GMA Iloilo's newscast \"Ratsada\" showed two instances that Sunshine Dizon's performance was sabotaged. The first came after Sunshine's first song, Jigo Mambo approached her for a short interview but their microphone audio went off and instead an audio from Sky Cable's talent came in.  The second incident came after Sunshine's supposed 2nd song when in the middle of her performance, a lady host from ABS-CBN came up the stage and hyped the crowd with the arrival of ABS-CBN talent Matt Evans of \"Pedro Penduko\" fame.  With her was \"Bongga\"'s Joan Jalandoni who was there to control the situation but her microphone went off.\n\nThe apparent sabotage earned the ire of Sunshine Dizon and her mother Dorothy Laforteza.  Also the management of [[DYAF-TV|ABS-CBN Iloilo]] was hands off after the incident, denying any involvement on their part.  The Dinagyang incident gave 15 minutes of nationwide fame for the two \"Bongga\" hosts Jigo and Joan, since the whole incident was aired over GMA's \"[[24 Oras]]\".  Joan was also among those interviewed about the incident together with Sunshine Dizon, Gabby Eigenmann and ABS-CBN Iloilo Station Manager Charie Ginete-Ilon.\n\n==Farewell Episode==\n\"Bongga!\" aired its farewell episode last September 2, 2007 without much fanfare.  Conspicuously, its main hosts Jigo Mambo and John Arceo were absent while female host Joan took hosting duties with 2 gay hosts.  At the closing credits, the message that read ''Madamo nga salamat, Kapuso! 1999-2007'' (Thank you very much Kapuso) was shown on the screen capped with the Kapuso logo.\n\n\"Bongga!\" went off the air at the height of its popularity, and it consistently retained its status as one of the premier top-rating local variety shows outside of Metro Manila.\n\n==Hosts==\n* Jigo Mambo\n* John Arceo\n* Leez Quimpo\n* Em Capalla\n* [[Angel Locsin]]\n* Joan Jalandoni\n\n;Former co-hosts\n* Hector Gloria (1999\u20132003)\n* Billy d' Kid (1999\u20132003)\n* Debbie Pelor (1999)\n* Ansab Urpiana (1999\u20132000)\n* Lara Alba (1999\u20132000)\n* Ruth (1999)\n* Tricia Aguirre (1999)\n* Sunshine Gregorio (2000)\n* Teresa Bacabac (2003\u20132004)\n* Candy Doronila (2000)\n* Varvin Hope Simon Hi\u00f1ola (2005\u20132006) - recurring\n* April Rose Arro (2003\u20132005; 2007)\n* Tuska Bianca Alivio (2003\u20132005)\n* Bonggastruck's  Ralph, Kara, Mark, Jhun Fil, Gladys, DT, Michael, Carlo (2005)\n* Charles Ea (2006)\n* Cherry May Barbo (2006\u20132007)\n* Kenneth Villanueva (2007)\n* Gilbert Onal Golez (2003\u20132007)\n* Carlo Quiat (2004\u20132006)\n\n;Guest co-hosts\n* [[KC Montero]]\n* [[Jake Cuenca]]\n* Gian Carlos\n* [[Luke Mijares]]\n* [[Sunshine Dizon]]\n* Tiya Pusit\n* [[Francine Prieto]]\n* [[Iwa Moto]]\n* [[Jolina Magdangal]]\n* [[Paolo Ballesteros]]\n* [[Arnel Ignacio]]\n\n==Directors==\n* Tricia Aguirre\n* Moonlight Lady\n* Elmo Benguan\n* Reggie Molina\n* Varvin Hope Simon Hi\u00f1ola\n\n==Accolades==\n* KBP Golden Dove Awardee- Best Provincial Variety Show (2001)\n* No. 1 Local Variety Show (Western Visayas) according to PSRC Survey (2000\u20132005)\n* Reyna ng Aliwan 2nd Runner Up Aliwan Festival- Bongga host Cherry May Barbo (2006)\n\n[[Category:GMA Network shows]]\n[[Category:Philippine variety television shows]]\n[[Category:Television in Iloilo City]]\n[[Category:1999 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2007 Philippine television series endings]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongga!"}

The series premiered on January 24, 2020 on [[Netflix]].\n\nThe partnership with [[Netflix]] led to criticism of the streaming company for giving Gwyneth Paltrow a platform to promote her company, which has been [[Goop (company)#Criticism|criticized for making unsubstantiated health claims]]. Multiple critics said this was a \"win for [[pseudoscience]]\".

Before the series was released even to reviewers, various media outlets criticized [[Netflix]] for producing a series with [[Goop (company)|Goop]] based on previous criticism of the company.{{R|Vox-1-10}}{{R|theconversation}}{{R|Respectful}}{{R|Huffpo}}{{R|wtm}}{{R|Cheat}}{{R|PatheosWilde}}\n\nMany sources described the show as promoting pseudoscience.{{R|thedailybeast|commentisfree|Bundel|ars-goopseries}}{{R|Bloomberg}}{{R|EWeekly}}{{R|Stevens}} Mia de Graaf wrote in ''[[Business Insider]]'' [[Malaysia]] that the series \"can legitimize unscientific, magical thinking about health, as well as pseudoscientific therapies... [and] further erode the foundations and trust in scientific professions.\"{{R|Malaysia}} Jonathan Jarry of McGill's [[Office for Science and Society]] wrote \"The core problem with the series, in my opinion, is its coronation of personal experience... [Such] anecdotes are dirty data: they are contaminated by a dozen variables...\"{{R|OSS}} ''[[Ars Technica]]'' similarly accused the series of making as if \"the subjective experiences of a few select individuals are equivalent to the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials...\"{{R|ArsTechnica}}\n\nSome of the criticism regarding pseudoscience focused on [[Netflix]].{{R|Reynolds}}\n\nOther critics concluded that science and medicine are not the correct standards by which to judge the Netflix series. The series announced in a disclaimer before each episode that \"The following series is designed to entertain and inform \u2014 not provide medical advice.\" Monica Hesse wrote in the ''Washington Post'': \"Maybe you [Gwyneth Paltrow] owe people more than curiosity. Maybe you owe them vigilance. And maybe this is getting too solemn a viewing exercise that was meant to be a lark. 'The Goop Lab' ultimately doesn\u2019t make a serious dent in conventional wisdom. Most of the crazy-sounding claims eventually wind their way toward something reasonable.\"{{R|WashPo}} Jen Chaney wrote in ''Vulture'': \"Goop, the website, has been called out before for pushing pseudoscience, and Netflix seems quite aware of that. Every episode is preceded by a disclaimer that says, 'The following series is designed to entertain and inform \u2014 not provide medical advice.' The truth is that none of the episodes seems to be trying to provide medical advice, really. And for the most part, the ideas they explore aren\u2019t super-woo-woo as much as they are a bit experimental. If you\u2019re the kind of person who thinks traditional thinking and standard Western medicine don\u2019t always adequately address every ailment that afflicts humans \u2014 and a great many rational individuals feel this way \u2014 a lot of what\u2019s in ''The Goop Lab'' won\u2019t seem completely out there.\"{{R|Vulture}}\n\nThose ideas were treated specifically by some critics. [[BBC News]] reported on topics covered by three of the episodes:{{R|BBC1}}\n* Psychedelics psychotherapy: \"The use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes has increased in recent years, with continuing studies in the US and the UK exploring their short-term and long-term impact on mental health disorders. They have so far been linked to having potentially positive effects related to the treatment of addiction, anxiety related to terminal illness, chronic PTSD, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety... While it found little to no evidence of participants experiencing increased life satisfaction, researchers indicated there were lower levels of stress and depression reported.\" Regarding microdosing, they reported \"The use of such powerful psychedelics outside of a controlled environment and without the proper medical expertise is not recommended by medical professionals.\"\n* Cold exposure therapy: \"There is some science behind Mr Hof's claims... However, cold-water swimming can be very dangerous - and there is a significant risk of hypothermia when not done in a controlled setting. There is also a risk from the body's acute cold shock response, which may affect the arm muscles while swimming and can lead to incapacitation and potential drowning within minutes if unsupervised.\"\n* Energy healing: \"Currently, there is no scientific evidence proving such energy exists.\" Regarding John Amaral's statements regarding quantum physics' proving his claims, physics professor Philip Moriarty told BBC News that Amaral's attempts to relate the theory to his practice were \"pure and utter nonsense.\"\n\nAddressing mediums, ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote \"Paltrow interviews a scientist who says she has carried out rigorous studies that prove mediums are real. But other work has shown that scientists are too easily fooled and that the best people at catching out mediums are professional magicians and illusionists. The researcher rolls out another cliche \u2013 'science is just one way of knowing' \u2013 which leaves me sceptical that she is appropriately sceptical.\"{{R|NewScientist}}\n\nAddressing the therapeutic usage of psychedelics and women's pleasure, Arielle Pardes wrote in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' that \"the show has its fair share of 'junk science, gibberish, and unproven health claims from snake-oil-salesmen guests,' as some reviews have pointed out. But there are reputable experts who share real science, too. The first episode, about the benefits of psychedelics, features an interview with Mark Haden, the executive director of MAPS Canada. MAPS, or the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, works closely with the FDA and promotes academic research and clinical studies around the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Another episode, on female orgasm, features Betty Dodson, the 90-year-old sex educator whose work has been instrumental in understanding pleasure.\"{{R|Pardes}}\n\nAddressing the therapeutic usage of psychedelics in ''[[Wired UK]]'', Victoria Turk was positive about the focus on the possible therapeutic applications of these drugs: \"in the past two decades, research studies and clinical trials have been conducted that involve LSD, psilocybin and other substances that we usually think of in a recreational context, often with the aim of exploring treatments for mental health disorders such as depression, addiction and PTSD,\" but bored by the lack of rigorous scientific discussion: \"This is where the episode really starts getting boring. ... [T]he exploration of the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics becomes so vague that we don\u2019t really learn anything at all. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s much wrong exactly; it\u2019s more that there\u2019s very little substance to begin with. The Goop members laugh, cry and cry some more. There\u2019s lots of talking about feelings that\u2019s all a bit too much for my British sensibility, and some very awkward-to-watch hugging.\" {{R|Turk}}\n\nAddressing the episode on women's sexual pleasure, in another ''[[Wired UK]]'' review, Sophie Charara wrote that \"Despite its star\u2019s shaky grip on anatomy, this episode manages to cover some of the most damaging sexual myths and taboos that still persist today.\"{{R|Charara}} Similarly, writing for ABC, Olivia Willis said that since \"Goop's record on women's health is not strong... You can imagine my surprise (and utter delight) to find 35 minutes of vulva anatomy, body positivity and frank discussions about women's sexual health and autonomy. The success of this episode is, in large part, thanks to Betty Dodson, a 90-year-old feminist sex educator and her colleague, Carlin Ross, who run workshops that aim to empower women with knowledge about their bodies. Dodson notes that many women feel shame or embarrassment when it comes to sex, and most of the episode is spent trying to counter this.\"{{R|ABC}}\n\nSome characterized the series as an \"infomercial,\"{{R|Atlantic}}{{R|Bloomberg2}}{{R|mangan}}{{R|Brisbane}} but others noted that it did not promote products.{{R|EWeekly}}\n\nCritics were also divided on the series' entertainment value. ''[[Ars Technica]]'', a [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] publication, concluded that \"the show is just, well, boring.\"{{R|ArsTechnica}} Writing in ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' under the headline \"Netflix\u2019s The Goop Lab pushes flimsy wellness trends. But it\u2019s strong on vulvas,\" Julia Belluz who had previously published a reaction to the series trailer said that \"When we watched the actual show, we found it was generally less edgy than the trailer suggested \u2014 some episodes were downright boring (like the 'health-span plan' about dieting for longevity), while others contained useful health messages (such as caring for and loving your body)\"{{R|Vox2}}\n\nOthers rated the series' entertainment value more highly. Reviewing the series in ''Vulture'', Jen Chaney wrote that \"I was fully prepared to hate The Goop Lab... I regret to inform everyone on the internet, where it\u2019s become a competitive sport to vocally loathe Paltrow and her website that sells vagina-scented candles for $75, that The Goop Lab isn\u2019t particularly hateable. Some of the episodes are even helpful... the half-hour installments, which each focus on a specific wellness topic and recruit Goop employees to try out various treatments and therapies, are actually interesting and informative. My chief complaint about The Goop Lab, believe it or not, is that its episodes need to be a little longer. I just wrote that sentence and meant it. I know: It\u2019s unbelievable to me, too!\"{{R|Vulture}}\n\nA few reviews claimed the show was entertaining and criticized it for being so. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that \"Paltrow is a compelling host \u2014 not giving too much of herself away, ever stopping short of pure endorsement of any topic even as she gives it air \u2014 on what is a carefully structured, elegantly built, compulsively watchable show about, mainly, complete nonsense.\"{{R|Variety}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the series was \"either unexpectedly moving or morally disgusting.\" By contrast, reviewing the show for the Washington Post, Monica Hesse was generally critical of Goop but begrudgingly praised Paltrow: \"Maybe one day I\u2019ll understand how I can actually love Gwyneth Paltrow, and yet find that, when I open my mouth, only snark comes out. Is it that I find her earnestness both poignant and poisonous? Do I fear my own inner truth? I\u2019d wager that anyone making time for \u201cThe Goop Lab\u201d is coming to it from a similar place: A love-hate desire to know what she's actually like when she doles out the advice that usually appears, disembodied, on her website. And the answer is: Thoughtful. Open. Searching. Curiosity is hard to fake, and Gwyneth has it, whether she's asking a doctor to explain his psychedelic research or querying one of her assistants/guinea pigs about the effects of an experiment.\"{{R|WashPo}} Daley Quinn similarly appraised [[Gwyneth Paltrow|Paltrow]]: \"Despite the fact that many of these episodes made me thoroughly uncomfortable, I couldn't help but become absolutely entranced by Paltrow, with her orphic aqua eyes, pastel outfits and aggressively California-cool-girl vibe. As I binged my way {{sic|though}} the episodes, I found her to be unfailingly funny and entertaining, and I came to understand why so many flock to her site daily in the hopes of Goop-ifying their lives.\"{{R|Fashionista}}\n\nWriting in the ''[[New York Times]]'', Elisa Albert and Jennifer Block gave a feminist critique of the criticism targeting ''The Goop Lab'' and [[Goop (company)|Goop]]: \"what underlies all the overwhelming, predictable, repetitive critiques? What exactly is so awful about a bunch of consenting adults seeking self-knowledge, vitality and emotional freedom? ... The tsunami of Goop hatred is best understood within a context that is much older and runs much deeper than Twitter, streaming platforms, consumerism or capitalism. Throughout history, women in particular have been mocked, reviled, and murdered for maintaining knowledge and practices that frightened, confused and confounded 'the authorities.' (Namely the church, and later, medicine.) Criticism of Goop is founded, at least in part, upon deeply ingrained reserves of fear, loathing, and ignorance about things we cannot see, touch, authenticate, prove, own or quantify. It is emblematic of a cultural insistence that we quash intuitive measures and 'other' ways of knowing \u2014 the sort handed down via oral tradition, which, for most women throughout history, was the only way of knowing. In other words, it\u2019s classic patriarchal devaluation.\" {{R|NYT}}\n\nSurmising the series main theme, message, and commercial appeal of the series, Pardes focused her ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' review on the idea of hope: \"What the show does most candidly, though, is shine a light on the desperation people feel when science cannot understand their pain. Throughout the series, we meet a Goop staffer suffering from a panic disorder, another who\u2019s dealing with the trauma of her father\u2019s suicide, and another who has trouble with intimacy since coming out as gay. Between the interviews and the staff stunts, there are various 'case studies,' like a veteran who tried to kill himself multiple times before finding MDMA-assisted therapy. If The Goop Lab is an informercial for the products it sells, it\u2019s also a portrait of the average Goop aficionado. They\u2019ve been failed by everything else; if a $300 crystal can make them feel better, why not try? If anyone stands to gain from The Goop Lab, though, it\u2019s not the viewers, or the staffers who jump at the chance to go on a 'shroom trip. It\u2019s the people whose products and alternative therapies are showcased on screen, each of whom can expect a sizable dose of interest after the exposure from Paltrow\u2019s show. After watching so many of Goop\u2019s staffers open up about their personal challenges and traumas, it\u2019s hard not to root for them to find a little peace. If energy healing does the trick, well, so be it.\"{{R|Pardes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"netflix\">{{cite web |title=the goop lab with Gwyneth Paltrow {{!}} Netflix |url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80244690 |website=[[Netflix]] |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Brisbane>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/what-we-haven-t-learned-from-belle-gibson-20200126-p53utm.html|title=What we haven't learned from Belle Gibson|last=Edwards|first=Kasey|date=2020-01-27|work=Brisbane Times|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.today/2020.01.27-115223/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/what-we-haven-t-learned-from-belle-gibson-20200126-p53utm.html|archive-date=2020-01-27|publisher=Fairfax Network|location=Qld.

Criticism of Goop is founded, at least in part, upon deeply ingrained reserves of fear, loathing, and ignorance about things we cannot see, touch, authenticate, prove, own or quantify. It is emblematic of a cultural insistence that we quash intuitive measures and \u201cother\u201d ways of knowing \u2014 the sort handed down via oral tradition, which, for most women throughout history, was the only way of knowing. In other words, it\u2019s classic patriarchal devaluation. When 19th-century medicine men were organizing and legitimizing their brand-new profession, they claimed the mantle of \u201cscience\u201d even though there was no such thing as evidence-based medicine at the time. In order to dominate the market, they slandered all other modalities as \u201cquackery,\u201d including midwifery, which we know achieved safer birth outcomes back then, as it still does today. Pejoratives like \u201cwoo\u201d or \u201cpseudoscience\u201d are still often applied to anything that falls outside of the mainstream medical establishment. (Think about this the next time you hear something harmless or odd or common-sensical dismissed as an \u201cold wives\u2019 tale.\u201d) Our society likes to conjoin the concepts of science and health, but the two do not always overlap.

The series premiered on January 24, 2020 on [[Netflix]].\n\nThe partnership with [[Netflix]] led to criticism of the streaming company for giving Gwyneth Paltrow a platform to promote her company, which has been [[Goop (company)#Criticism|criticized for making unsubstantiated health claims]]. Multiple critics said this was a \"win for [[pseudoscience]]\". Upon release of the first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]], and again after the full 6-episode series was available for review, the series received significant criticism concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.\n\n==Premise==\n''The Goop Lab'' promotes Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness and lifestyle business, [[Goop (company)|Goop]]. Episodes cover [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] topics in [[Energy medicine|energy healing]], the use of [[psychedelic drug]]s, [[Cryotherapy|cold therapy]], [[Life extension|anti-aging]], [[mediumship]], and [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]].{{R|tvline|thecut|pastemagazine}} Prior to each episode, a [[disclaimer]] is presented declaring \"The following series is designed to entertain and inform \u2013 not provide medical advice\".{{R|Brisbane}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=50 |background=#f09daf |overall= |title= |airdate= |airdateR={{R|netflix}} |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = The Healing Trip\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers psychedelic drugs; features the psychiatrist Will Siu and the researcher Mark Haden.<!--\"Hayden\" appears to be an error in the source--><ref name=\"psychedelics episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Cold Comfort\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers the [[Wim Hof Method]] and cold therapy; features the extreme athlete [[Wim Hof]].<ref name=\"cold therapy episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = The Pleasure Is Ours\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers female sexuality; features the sex educators [[Betty Dodson]] and Carlin Ross<ref name=\"sexuality episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = The Health-Span Plan\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers anti-aging; features the biologists [[Valter Longo]] and Morgan Levine<ref name=\"anti-aging episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = The Energy Experience\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers energy healing; features the practitioners John Aramal and Apostolos Lekkos<ref name=\"energy healing episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Are You Intuit?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|01|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = Covers mediumship; features the medium Laura Lynne Jackson and the parapsychologist Julie Beischel<ref name=\"mediumship episode\"/>\n| LineColor       = #f09daf\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 2019, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had accepted a six-part series showcasing Goop.{{R|tvline}} On January 6, 2020, Netflix released the first trailer, and announced that the series would be released on January 24, 2020.{{R|hollywoodreporter}}\n\nThe series is executive produced by Paltrow, [[Elise Loehnen]], [[Andrew Fried]], Shauna Minoprio, and Dane Lillegard for [[Boardwalk Pictures]].{{R|hollywoodreporter}}{{R|tvweb}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Goop Lab'' was criticized for various reasons. Before the series was released even to reviewers, various media outlets criticized [[Netflix]] for producing a series with [[Goop (company)|Goop]] based on previous criticism of the company.{{R|Vox-1-10}}{{R|theconversation}}{{R|Respectful}}{{R|Huffpo}}{{R|wtm}}{{R|Cheat}}{{R|PatheosWilde}}\n\nMany sources described the show as promoting pseudoscience.{{R|thedailybeast|commentisfree|Bundel|ars-goopseries}}{{R|Bloomberg}}{{R|EWeekly}}{{R|Stevens}} Mia de Graaf wrote in ''[[Business Insider]]'' [[Malaysia]] that the series \"can legitimize unscientific, magical thinking about health, as well as pseudoscientific therapies... [and] further erode the foundations and trust in scientific professions.\"{{R|Malaysia}} Jonathan Jarry of McGill's [[Office for Science and Society]] wrote \"The core problem with the series, in my opinion, is its coronation of personal experience... [Such] anecdotes are dirty data: they are contaminated by a dozen variables...\"{{R|OSS}} ''[[Ars Technica]]'' similarly accused the series of making as if \"the subjective experiences of a few select individuals are equivalent to the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials...\"{{R|ArsTechnica}}\n\nSome of the criticism regarding pseudoscience focused on [[Netflix]].{{R|Reynolds}}\n\nOther critics concluded that science and medicine are not the correct standards by which to judge the Netflix series. The series announced in a disclaimer before each episode that \"The following series is designed to entertain and inform \u2014 not provide medical advice.\" Monica Hesse wrote in the ''Washington Post'': \"Maybe you [Gwyneth Paltrow] owe people more than curiosity. Maybe you owe them vigilance. And maybe this is getting too solemn a viewing exercise that was meant to be a lark. 'The Goop Lab' ultimately doesn\u2019t make a serious dent in conventional wisdom. Most of the crazy-sounding claims eventually wind their way toward something reasonable.\"{{R|WashPo}} Jen Chaney wrote in ''Vulture'': \"Goop, the website, has been called out before for pushing pseudoscience, and Netflix seems quite aware of that. Every episode is preceded by a disclaimer that says, 'The following series is designed to entertain and inform \u2014 not provide medical advice.' The truth is that none of the episodes seems to be trying to provide medical advice, really. And for the most part, the ideas they explore aren\u2019t super-woo-woo as much as they are a bit experimental. If you\u2019re the kind of person who thinks traditional thinking and standard Western medicine don\u2019t always adequately address every ailment that afflicts humans \u2014 and a great many rational individuals feel this way \u2014 a lot of what\u2019s in ''The Goop Lab'' won\u2019t seem completely out there.\"{{R|Vulture}}\n\nThose ideas were treated specifically by some critics. [[BBC News]] reported on topics covered by three of the episodes:{{R|BBC1}}\n* Psychedelics psychotherapy: \"The use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes has increased in recent years, with continuing studies in the US and the UK exploring their short-term and long-term impact on mental health disorders. They have so far been linked to having potentially positive effects related to the treatment of addiction, anxiety related to terminal illness, chronic PTSD, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety... While it found little to no evidence of participants experiencing increased life satisfaction, researchers indicated there were lower levels of stress and depression reported.\" Regarding microdosing, they reported \"The use of such powerful psychedelics outside of a controlled environment and without the proper medical expertise is not recommended by medical professionals.\"\n* Cold exposure therapy: \"There is some science behind Mr Hof's claims... However, cold-water swimming can be very dangerous - and there is a significant risk of hypothermia when not done in a controlled setting. There is also a risk from the body's acute cold shock response, which may affect the arm muscles while swimming and can lead to incapacitation and potential drowning within minutes if unsupervised.\"\n* Energy healing: \"Currently, there is no scientific evidence proving such energy exists.\" Regarding John Amaral's statements regarding quantum physics' proving his claims, physics professor Philip Moriarty told BBC News that Amaral's attempts to relate the theory to his practice were \"pure and utter nonsense.\"\n\nAddressing mediums, ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote \"Paltrow interviews a scientist who says she has carried out rigorous studies that prove mediums are real. But other work has shown that scientists are too easily fooled and that the best people at catching out mediums are professional magicians and illusionists. The researcher rolls out another cliche \u2013 'science is just one way of knowing' \u2013 which leaves me sceptical that she is appropriately sceptical.\"{{R|NewScientist}}\n\nAddressing the therapeutic usage of psychedelics and women's pleasure, Arielle Pardes wrote in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' that \"the show has its fair share of 'junk science, gibberish, and unproven health claims from snake-oil-salesmen guests,' as some reviews have pointed out. But there are reputable experts who share real science, too. The first episode, about the benefits of psychedelics, features an interview with Mark Haden, the executive director of MAPS Canada. MAPS, or the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, works closely with the FDA and promotes academic research and clinical studies around the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Another episode, on female orgasm, features Betty Dodson, the 90-year-old sex educator whose work has been instrumental in understanding pleasure.\"{{R|Pardes}}\n\nAddressing the therapeutic usage of psychedelics in ''[[Wired UK]]'', Victoria Turk was positive about the focus on the possible therapeutic applications of these drugs: \"in the past two decades, research studies and clinical trials have been conducted that involve LSD, psilocybin and other substances that we usually think of in a recreational context, often with the aim of exploring treatments for mental health disorders such as depression, addiction and PTSD,\" but bored by the lack of rigorous scientific discussion: \"This is where the episode really starts getting boring. ... [T]he exploration of the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics becomes so vague that we don\u2019t really learn anything at all. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s much wrong exactly; it\u2019s more that there\u2019s very little substance to begin with. The Goop members laugh, cry and cry some more. There\u2019s lots of talking about feelings that\u2019s all a bit too much for my British sensibility, and some very awkward-to-watch hugging.\" {{R|Turk}}\n\nAddressing the episode on women's sexual pleasure, in another ''[[Wired UK]]'' review, Sophie Charara wrote that \"Despite its star\u2019s shaky grip on anatomy, this episode manages to cover some of the most damaging sexual myths and taboos that still persist today.\"{{R|Charara}} Similarly, writing for ABC, Olivia Willis said that since \"Goop's record on women's health is not strong... You can imagine my surprise (and utter delight) to find 35 minutes of vulva anatomy, body positivity and frank discussions about women's sexual health and autonomy. The success of this episode is, in large part, thanks to Betty Dodson, a 90-year-old feminist sex educator and her colleague, Carlin Ross, who run workshops that aim to empower women with knowledge about their bodies. Dodson notes that many women feel shame or embarrassment when it comes to sex, and most of the episode is spent trying to counter this.\"{{R|ABC}}\n\nSome characterized the series as an \"infomercial,\"{{R|Atlantic}}{{R|Bloomberg2}}{{R|mangan}}{{R|Brisbane}} but others noted that it did not promote products.{{R|EWeekly}}\n\nCritics were also divided on the series' entertainment value. ''[[Ars Technica]]'', a [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] publication, concluded that \"the show is just, well, boring.\"{{R|ArsTechnica}} Writing in ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' under the headline \"Netflix\u2019s The Goop Lab pushes flimsy wellness trends. But it\u2019s strong on vulvas,\" Julia Belluz who had previously published a reaction to the series trailer said that \"When we watched the actual show, we found it was generally less edgy than the trailer suggested \u2014 some episodes were downright boring (like the 'health-span plan' about dieting for longevity), while others contained useful health messages (such as caring for and loving your body)\"{{R|Vox2}}\n\nOthers rated the series' entertainment value more highly. Reviewing the series in ''Vulture'', Jen Chaney wrote that \"I was fully prepared to hate The Goop Lab... I regret to inform everyone on the internet, where it\u2019s become a competitive sport to vocally loathe Paltrow and her website that sells vagina-scented candles for $75, that The Goop Lab isn\u2019t particularly hateable. Some of the episodes are even helpful... the half-hour installments, which each focus on a specific wellness topic and recruit Goop employees to try out various treatments and therapies, are actually interesting and informative. My chief complaint about The Goop Lab, believe it or not, is that its episodes need to be a little longer. I just wrote that sentence and meant it. I know: It\u2019s unbelievable to me, too!\"{{R|Vulture}}\n\nA few reviews claimed the show was entertaining and criticized it for being so. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that \"Paltrow is a compelling host \u2014 not giving too much of herself away, ever stopping short of pure endorsement of any topic even as she gives it air \u2014 on what is a carefully structured, elegantly built, compulsively watchable show about, mainly, complete nonsense.\"{{R|Variety}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the series was \"either unexpectedly moving or morally disgusting.\" By contrast, reviewing the show for the Washington Post, Monica Hesse was generally critical of Goop but begrudgingly praised Paltrow: \"Maybe one day I\u2019ll understand how I can actually love Gwyneth Paltrow, and yet find that, when I open my mouth, only snark comes out. Is it that I find her earnestness both poignant and poisonous? Do I fear my own inner truth? I\u2019d wager that anyone making time for \u201cThe Goop Lab\u201d is coming to it from a similar place: A love-hate desire to know what she's actually like when she doles out the advice that usually appears, disembodied, on her website. And the answer is: Thoughtful. Open. Searching. Curiosity is hard to fake, and Gwyneth has it, whether she's asking a doctor to explain his psychedelic research or querying one of her assistants/guinea pigs about the effects of an experiment.\"{{R|WashPo}} Daley Quinn similarly appraised [[Gwyneth Paltrow|Paltrow]]: \"Despite the fact that many of these episodes made me thoroughly uncomfortable, I couldn't help but become absolutely entranced by Paltrow, with her orphic aqua eyes, pastel outfits and aggressively California-cool-girl vibe. As I binged my way though the episodes, I found her to be unfailingly funny and entertaining, and I came to understand why so many flock to her site daily in the hopes of Goop-ifying their lives.\"{{R|Fashionista}}\n\nWriting in the ''[[New York Times]]'', Elisa Albert and Jennifer Block gave a feminist critique of the criticism targeting ''The Goop Lab'' and [[Goop (company)|Goop]]: \"what underlies all the overwhelming, predictable, repetitive critiques? What exactly is so awful about a bunch of consenting adults seeking self-knowledge, vitality and emotional freedom? ... The tsunami of Goop hatred is best understood within a context that is much older and runs much deeper than Twitter, streaming platforms, consumerism or capitalism. Throughout history, women in particular have been mocked, reviled, and murdered for maintaining knowledge and practices that frightened, confused and confounded 'the authorities.' (Namely the church, and later, medicine.) Criticism of Goop is founded, at least in part, upon deeply ingrained reserves of fear, loathing, and ignorance about things we cannot see, touch, authenticate, prove, own or quantify. It is emblematic of a cultural insistence that we quash intuitive measures and 'other' ways of knowing \u2014 the sort handed down via oral tradition, which, for most women throughout history, was the only way of knowing. In other words, it\u2019s classic patriarchal devaluation.\" {{R|NYT}}\n\nSurmising the series main theme, message, and commercial appeal of the series, Pardes focused her ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' review on the idea of hope: \"What the show does most candidly, though, is shine a light on the desperation people feel when science cannot understand their pain. Throughout the series, we meet a Goop staffer suffering from a panic disorder, another who\u2019s dealing with the trauma of her father\u2019s suicide, and another who has trouble with intimacy since coming out as gay. Between the interviews and the staff stunts, there are various 'case studies,' like a veteran who tried to kill himself multiple times before finding MDMA-assisted therapy. If The Goop Lab is an informercial for the products it sells, it\u2019s also a portrait of the average Goop aficionado. They\u2019ve been failed by everything else; if a $300 crystal can make them feel better, why not try? If anyone stands to gain from The Goop Lab, though, it\u2019s not the viewers, or the staffers who jump at the chance to go on a 'shroom trip. It\u2019s the people whose products and alternative therapies are showcased on screen, each of whom can expect a sizable dose of interest after the exposure from Paltrow\u2019s show. After watching so many of Goop\u2019s staffers open up about their personal challenges and traumas, it\u2019s hard not to root for them to find a little peace.

Criticism of Goop is founded, at least in part, upon deeply ingrained reserves of fear, loathing, and ignorance about things we cannot see, touch, authenticate, prove, own or quantify. It is emblematic of a cultural insistence that we quash intuitive measures and \u201cother\u201d ways of knowing \u2014 the sort handed down via oral tradition, which, for most women throughout history, was the only way of knowing. In other words, it\u2019s classic patriarchal devaluation. When 19th-century medicine men were organizing and legitimizing their brand-new profession, they claimed the mantle of \u201cscience\u201d even though there was no such thing as evidence-based medicine at the time. In order to dominate the market, they slandered all other modalities as \u201cquackery,\u201d including midwifery, which we know achieved safer birth outcomes back then, as it still does today. Pejoratives like \u201cwoo\u201d or \u201cpseudoscience\u201d are still often applied to anything that falls outside of the mainstream medical establishment. (Think about this the next time you hear something harmless or odd or common-sensical dismissed as an \u201cold wives\u2019 tale.\u201d) Our society likes to conjoin the concepts of science and health, but the two do not always overlap. Peer-reviewed, lab-generated, randomized, controlled, double-blinded evidence will always be the gold standard, but such studies aren\u2019t always fundable, or ethical. We kiss our children\u2019s boo-boos even though there\u2019s no gold standard evidence that it will make them feel better. We just know that it does. Which in turn makes us feel better.

Early Life Infection and Neuroimmunity ====\nShortly after becoming a professor at Duke, Bilbo used the neonatal bacterial infection model she developed in her postdoctoral work to explore how neonatal infection affects glial cell biology and immune functions later in life, specifically after a second environmental challenge.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Sondra

cytokine release after a drug challenge later in life compared to controls who were not neonatally infected.<ref name=\":12\" /> Following findings from her postdoctoral work highlighting [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1B]] dysregulation after neonatal infection, Bilbo explored a mechanistic understanding of immune dysregulation after early-life infection. She further wanted to explore how this dysfunction is unmasked after a second immune challenge later in life.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Lauren L.|last2=Sholar|first2=Paige

sensitizes microglia such that upon a second environmental challenge, microglia become easily activated and release large amounts of IL-1B which leads to learning and memory impairments.<ref

This reference indicates that a \"temporary\" Rest House or Barracks was provided there much earlier, more likely at or near the time of opening, in the 1898 period. The style of barracks usually provided in the 1890s, up until the early 1900s at many locations in the state, usually consisted of what was known as 'Engine Driver's' and \"Guards Accommodation\". These buildings were of a railway standards design and resembled a moderately -sized hip roofed cottage. They usually had two or three bedrooms at the front of the building, a kitchen and meal room toward the rear, with a bathroom and laundry at the rear. The toilet was usually a separate building out in the yard. In this situation, a train crew (driver, fireman and guard) would all sleep in the one room, three iron bedsteads being provided. These buildings were provided at many locations at the time, and it was quite likely that one was built at Parkes, and remained there until the 1911 period. No evidence of the location of any such temporary structure was found at or near the present barracks building.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe Parkes station opened on 18 December 1893.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Parkes&line=NSW:main_north:0 Parkes Station] NSWrail.net</ref>\n\nParkes is the junction point for the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill]], [[Stockinbingal\u2013Parkes railway line|Stockingbingal-Parkes]] and [[Parkes\u2013Narromine railway line|Parkes-Narromine]] lines, the latter two form a cross country route between [[Cootamundra railway station|Cootamundra]] on the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main South line]], and [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]].

Originally the building was a five-room gabled building which featured a central waiting room with a Station Master's office and parcel office to the western side flanked by a shed and lamp room wing, with a ladies and gents waiting room to the east flanked by a bathroom wing. Historic plans show three brick [[chimneys]] and gablet vents and a front [[veranda]]h to the entry which all still exist. Timber [[finial]]s to [[gable]] ends still exist on the original detached wings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe building underwent alterations in 1926 and further alterations in 1947 which extended the building to either end to incorporate the previous external wings in to the form of the main building and also altering the use of most rooms. The extensions were undertaken in a sympathetic manner including matching windows and an extended platform [[awning]] to match the existing. As such the building presents as a cohesive building that still retains its Victorian character. The brick platform dates from 1893 and was extended {{circa|1928}} and features modern asphalt surfacing.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Railway refreshment rooms ({{circa|1928}})\nFrom historic plans it appears prior to the current building being erected on this site, that there were previously two small structures used as temporary Railway Refreshment rooms and accommodation for the staff. In 1923, a {{convert|12|by|6|m|adj=on}} marquee built of Birkmyre cloth with framing and flooring was erected as a refreshment room.<ref name=nswshr-1220-1747>Forsyth, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nPlans from {{circa|1928}} show the demolition of the previous structures and the erection of the existing brick building on the same site. Further historic plans show minor alterations in 1939 and a further extension to the west in 1943. The building is unusual in that it appears to be composed of two different buildings with a gabled part fronting on to the platform with a cantilevered awning, and a rear kitchen wing with a brick [[parapet]] with projecting string course.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Signal Box (1944)\nTwo-storey elevated fibro signal box with low [[Hipped roof|hipped]] pyramid roof clad in concrete tiles.

The existing footbridge replaced an earlier footbridge which had been relocated from Liverpool in 1923. The bridge is noted as the last riveted truss footbridge constructed for the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe station buildings including the 1920s and 1940s additions have a high level of integrity.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nNumerous additions and changes occurred throughout the 20th century including erection of a rest house (1912), wheat silo (1920), Traffic District Headquarters located at Parkes (1920), purchase of existing residences for Station Master and Steam Shed Inspector, (1920 and 1922), conversion of existing Station Master's residence to railway refreshment room accommodation (1923), new footbridge relocated from Liverpool (1923), erection of temporary railway refreshment rooms (1923), alterations and additions to the station building ({{circa|1927}}) rail motor shed erected (1927), new railway refreshment rooms opened (1928), relocated footbridge and signal Box (1928) and a new roundhouse built (1928).<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nLater alterations to the site included a new footbridge (1935), an elevated coal bunker built (1941), roundhouse and facilities enlarged for defence works, including new {{convert|360|kL|e3impgal e3USgal}} tank and stand, boiler plant, water [[columns]], {{convert|75|ft|adj=on}} diameter turntable replacing {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} (1944), new Institute Building opened (1962), and new goods shed built (1964).<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n[[File:PARKES-RAILWAY-STATION-DEC-2019.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Parkes railway station]]\nAs at 19 July 2013, Parkes Railway Precinct is of state significance as an important major railway junction that is associated with the earliest development of railway infrastructure in the west of NSW in the late 19th century. The precinct features a fine, albeit altered, example of a Victorian station building dating from the opening of the precinct in 1893. The precinct includes a locomotive depot with a partial roundhouse and remains of the former goods yard and a range of items typically found at many large railway complexes in NSW from the late 19th and 20th centuries including the footbridge, jib crane and dock platform, which all contribute to the significance of Parkes as a major railway junction. The Roundhouse is significant as only one of seven surviving structures. The footbridge is notable as the last riveted [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] truss footbridge constructed for the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nParkes railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe place has historic significance to demonstrate the late 19th and early 20th century development of the NSW railways as a major junction station that expanded in conjunction with the development of branch lines throughout western NSW. The station building dates from the opening of the line at Parkes in 1893, and along with other related structures has the ability to provide evidence of a late 19th century and early 20th century working railway precinct. The complex of related railway structures at Parkes are significant as evidence of a major junction station which continues to be a key station in the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe station building is a fine, albeit modified, example of a late Victorian station building with later sympathetic additions that retain the original Victorian character and detailing of the building. The adjoining railway refreshment room dating from 1928 is a good example of a large single storey refreshment room. The two buildings form a coherent group of related railway structures complemented by their large decorative platform awnings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe social significance of the place has not been formally assessed through community consultation but no specific strong or special social associations within the local community have been identified through the existing evidence.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nNo research values have been identified that are not readily found at other similar railway sites in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has rarity significance as the roundhouse is one of only seven similar structures in NSW, although better examples exist. The footbridge is notable as the last riveted Warren truss footbridge constructed on the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has representative significance for its collection of railway structures including the station building, railway refreshment rooms, signal box, footbridge, crane, locomotive depot and other related items that collectively demonstrate widespread 19th and early 20th century railway customs, activities and design in NSW, and are representative of similar items that are found at other railway sites in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways}}}}\n[[:Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales|List of regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Parkes Railway Station group|url=http://www.parkes.nsw.gov.au/about/1003.html}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Parkes Railway Station group|dno=5012129|id=01220|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline}}\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10155056#/ Parkes station details] Transport for New South Wales\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Western Region=y|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1893]]\n[[Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Parkes Shire]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:1893 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox station\n|name                = Parkes\n|type                = \n|style               = NSW TrainLink regional\n|image               = Parkes Railway Station.jpg\n|image_size          = \n|image_caption       = Westbound view in March 2009\n|address             = Welcome Street, [[Parkes, New South Wales]]\n|country             = Australia\n|coordinates         = {{coord|-33.1421|148.1733|region:AU-NSW_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline,title}} \n|elevation           = \n|distance            = {{convert|445.5|km|abbr=on}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central]]\n|line                = [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill]]\n|other               = \n|structure           = Ground\n|platform            = 1\n|depth               = \n|levels              = \n|tracks              = 4\n|parking             = \n|bicycle             = \n|opened              = 18 December 1893\n|closed              = \n|rebuilt             = \n|electrified         = \n|disabled            = \n|code                = [[List of New South Wales railway station codes|PKE]]\n|owned               = [[RailCorp]]\n|operator            = [[NSW TrainLink]]\n|zone                = \n|former              = \n|passengers          = \n|pass_year           = \n|pass_percent        = \n|pass_system         = \n|mpassengers         = \n|services            = {{s-rail|title=NSW Country lines}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW Country lines|line=Broken Hill|previous=Brolgan|next=Mugincoble}}\n{{s-rail-next|title=NSW Branch lines}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW Country lines|line=Stockinbingal- Parkes|previous=Tichborne|next=}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW Country lines|line=Parkes- Narromine|previous=|next=Nanardine}}\n{{s-rail-next|title=NSW TrainLink}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW TrainLink|line=Western|branch=Broken Hill Outback Xplorer|previous=Condobolin|next=Orange}}\n| map_type            = Australia New South Wales\n| map_overlay         = <!-- Overlay image file name, to be placed on top of the main map.

No evidence of the location of any such temporary structure was found at or near the present barracks building.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe Parkes station opened on 18 December 1893.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Parkes&line=NSW:main_north:0 Parkes Station] NSWrail.net</ref>\n\nParkes is the junction point for the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill]], [[Stockinbingal\u2013Parkes railway line|Stockingbingal-Parkes]] and [[Parkes\u2013Narromine railway line|Parkes-Narromine]] lines, the latter two form a cross country route between [[Cootamundra railway station|Cootamundra]] on the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main South line]], and [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]].

Originally the building was a five-room gabled building which featured a central waiting room with a Station Master's office and parcel office to the western side flanked by a shed and lamp room wing, with a ladies and gents waiting room to the east flanked by a bathroom wing. Historic plans show three brick [[chimneys]] and gablet vents and a front [[veranda]]h to the entry which all still exist. Timber [[finial]]s to [[gable]] ends still exist on the original detached wings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe building underwent alterations in 1926 and further alterations in 1947 which extended the building to either end to incorporate the previous external wings in to the form of the main building and also altering the use of most rooms. The extensions were undertaken in a sympathetic manner including matching windows and an extended platform [[awning]] to match the existing. As such the building presents as a cohesive building that still retains its Victorian character. The brick platform dates from 1893 and was extended {{circa|1928}} and features modern asphalt surfacing.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Railway refreshment rooms ({{circa|1928}})\nFrom historic plans it appears prior to the current building being erected on this site, that there were previously two small structures used as temporary Railway Refreshment rooms and accommodation for the staff. In 1923, a {{convert|12|by|6|m|adj=on}} marquee built of Birkmyre cloth with framing and flooring was erected as a refreshment room.<ref name=nswshr-1220-1747>Forsyth, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nPlans from {{circa|1928}} show the demolition of the previous structures and the erection of the existing brick building on the same site. Further historic plans show minor alterations in 1939 and a further extension to the west in 1943. The building is unusual in that it appears to be composed of two different buildings with a gabled part fronting on to the platform with a cantilevered awning, and a rear kitchen wing with a brick [[parapet]] with projecting string course.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Signal Box (1944)\nTwo-storey elevated fibro signal box with low [[Hipped roof|hipped]] pyramid roof clad in concrete tiles. The signal box is no longer in use.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Footbridge (1935)\nA steel riveted through Warren truss footbridge on steel trestles and channel iron stair stringers with Kembla markings on steel sections. The existing footbridge replaced an earlier footbridge which had been relocated from Liverpool in 1923. The bridge is noted as the last riveted truss footbridge constructed for the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe station buildings including the 1920s and 1940s additions have a high level of integrity.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nNumerous additions and changes occurred throughout the 20th century including erection of a rest house (1912), wheat silo (1920), Traffic District Headquarters located at Parkes (1920), purchase of existing residences for Station Master and Steam Shed Inspector, (1920 and 1922), conversion of existing Station Master's residence to railway refreshment room accommodation (1923), new footbridge relocated from Liverpool (1923), erection of temporary railway refreshment rooms (1923), alterations and additions to the station building ({{circa|1927}}) rail motor shed erected (1927), new railway refreshment rooms opened (1928), relocated footbridge and signal Box (1928) and a new roundhouse built (1928).<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nLater alterations to the site included a new footbridge (1935), an elevated coal bunker built (1941), roundhouse and facilities enlarged for defence works, including new {{convert|360|kL|e3impgal e3USgal}} tank and stand, boiler plant, water [[columns]], {{convert|75|ft|adj=on}} diameter turntable replacing {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} (1944), new Institute Building opened (1962), and new goods shed built (1964).<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n[[File:PARKES-RAILWAY-STATION-DEC-2019.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Parkes railway station]]\nAs at 19 July 2013, Parkes Railway Precinct is of state significance as an important major railway junction that is associated with the earliest development of railway infrastructure in the west of NSW in the late 19th century. The precinct features a fine, albeit altered, example of a Victorian station building dating from the opening of the precinct in 1893. The precinct includes a locomotive depot with a partial roundhouse and remains of the former goods yard and a range of items typically found at many large railway complexes in NSW from the late 19th and 20th centuries including the footbridge, jib crane and dock platform, which all contribute to the significance of Parkes as a major railway junction. The Roundhouse is significant as only one of seven surviving structures. The footbridge is notable as the last riveted [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] truss footbridge constructed for the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nParkes railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe place has historic significance to demonstrate the late 19th and early 20th century development of the NSW railways as a major junction station that expanded in conjunction with the development of branch lines throughout western NSW. The station building dates from the opening of the line at Parkes in 1893, and along with other related structures has the ability to provide evidence of a late 19th century and early 20th century working railway precinct. The complex of related railway structures at Parkes are significant as evidence of a major junction station which continues to be a key station in the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe station building is a fine, albeit modified, example of a late Victorian station building with later sympathetic additions that retain the original Victorian character and detailing of the building. The adjoining railway refreshment room dating from 1928 is a good example of a large single storey refreshment room. The two buildings form a coherent group of related railway structures complemented by their large decorative platform awnings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe social significance of the place has not been formally assessed through community consultation but no specific strong or special social associations within the local community have been identified through the existing evidence.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nNo research values have been identified that are not readily found at other similar railway sites in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has rarity significance as the roundhouse is one of only seven similar structures in NSW, although better examples exist. The footbridge is notable as the last riveted Warren truss footbridge constructed on the NSW network.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has representative significance for its collection of railway structures including the station building, railway refreshment rooms, signal box, footbridge, crane, locomotive depot and other related items that collectively demonstrate widespread 19th and early 20th century railway customs, activities and design in NSW, and are representative of similar items that are found at other railway sites in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Railways}}}}\n[[:Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales|List of regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Parkes Railway Station group|url=http://www.parkes.nsw.gov.au/about/1003.html}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Parkes Railway Station group|dno=5012129|id=01220|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline}}\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10155056#/ Parkes station details] Transport for New South Wales\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Western Region=y|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1893]]\n[[Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Parkes Shire]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:1893 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Fork99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo; previous edit accidentally finished too early: Removed 'the' as starting word as following term is a singular noun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_railway_station"}
