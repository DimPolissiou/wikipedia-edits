In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]\n\nIn [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).\n\nIn byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\"/> usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance.\n\n{{anchor|Pseudo-tetrade}}The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades''<ref name=\"Klar_1970\"/><ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}},<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/><ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\"/><ref name=\"Tietze-Schenk_2013\"/><ref name=\"Kowalski_1070\"/> ''pseudo-decimals''<ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> or ''pseudo-decimal digit''.<ref name=\"Ferretti_2013\"/><ref name=\"Speiser_1965\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\"/>\n\nBCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetic and a slightly less dense storage.\n\nBCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]], the [[Burroughs B1700]], and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.<ref name=\"Cowlishaw_GDA\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==\nBCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is \"natural BCD\" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called \"8421\" encoding.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digit\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | BCD\n|-\n! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|}\n\nOther encodings are also used, including so-called \"4221\" and \"7421\"\u2014named after the weighting used for the bits\u2014and \"[[Excess-3]]\".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&lpg=PA20}}</ref> For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.\n\nAs most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:\n* '''Unpacked''': Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance.\n* '''Packed''': Two decimal digits are encoded into a single byte, with one digit in the least significant [[nibble]] ([[Bit numbering#Most- vs least-significant bit first|bits 0 through 3]]) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).\n\nAs an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>'''91'''</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:\n Decimal:         9         1\n Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001\n\nIn packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:\n Decimal:    9    1\n Binary : 1001 0001\n\nHence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.\n\nTo represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number <tt>'''12345'''</tt> in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:\n Decimal:    0    1    2    3    4    5\n Binary : 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101\n\nHere, the most significant nibble of the most significant byte has been encoded as zero, so the number is stored as <tt>'''012345'''</tt> (but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeros). Packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage than unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.\n\n[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.\n\n==BCD in electronics==\n{{Multiple issues|section=true|{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}}}\n\nBCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Packed BCD==\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\nIn '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.\n\nStandard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (\u2212). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).<ref name=\"IBM_POP\">{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_PDP11\">{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\">{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}</ref> ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}</ref> These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and \u2212127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:40%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign<br>Digit\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|BCD<br>8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:40%;\"|Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|A\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|B\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|C\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|D\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|E\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|F\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''+'''\n| Unsigned\n|}\n\nNo matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')\u22121 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.\n\nFor example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from \u00b19,999,999. Thus the number \u22121,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:\n 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101\n ''1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u2212''\n\nLike character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal{{snd}} that with the most significant two digits{{snd}} is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.\n\nIn contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from \u22122,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n\nWhile packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.\n\nPacked BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the \"COMPUTATIONAL-3\" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or \"PACKED-DECIMAL\" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as \"FIXED DECIMAL\". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).\n\n[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from \u221250,000,000 to +49,999,999, and \u22121 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)\n\n===Fixed-point packed decimal===\n[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:\n 12 34 56 7C\n ''12 34.56 7+''\n\nThe decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.\n\n===Higher-density encodings===\nIf a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is greater than 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.\n\n=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==\nSome implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the \"zone\" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters \"0\" through \"9\". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).\n\nFor signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value \u2212123:\n F1 F2 D3\n '' 1 2 \u22123''\n\n===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===\n<!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. -->\n{| style=\"margin:auto;

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:\n F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0\n '' 1 2 7 9. 5 +0''\n\n{{Anchor|IBMBCD}}<!--- keep anchor with following section, \"IBM and BCD\" --->\n\n==IBM and BCD==\n{{Main|BCDIC}}\n[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].\n\nThe [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the \"12\", \"11\", and \"0\" \"zone punches\" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A \"12 zone\" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an \"11 zone\" set ''B'', and a \"0 zone\" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the \"zone\" in the even-addressed digit and the \"digit\" in the odd-addressed digit, the \"zone\" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' \"zone punches\" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nIn the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the \"zone\" in the left digit and the \"digit\" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nWith the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.\n\nOn the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.\n\nToday, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or \"pure\" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.<ref>http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Other computers and BCD==\nThe [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.<ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\"/> The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.\n\nThe [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|pages=4\u20139|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.<ref name=\"m68k\">url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf</ref>\n\nIn more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Jones_AT\">{{cite web |title=BCD Arithmetic, a tutorial |work=Arithmetic Tutorials |author-first=Douglas W. |author-last=Jones |author-link=Douglas W.

Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 \u2013 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:\n 1001 + 1000 = 10001\n 9 + 8 = 17\n\n10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result, but the most-significant 1 (the \"carry\") cannot fit in a 4-bit binary number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to the total and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:\n\n 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 => 0001 0111\n 17 + 6 = 23 1 7\n\nThe two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits \"1\" and \"7\". This yields \"17\" in BCD, which is the correct result.\n\nThis technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.\n\n===Subtraction with BCD===\nSubtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]] to the [[minuend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 \u2212 432.\n\nIn signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 \u2212 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number \u2212432 can be represented. So, \u2212432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.\n\nNow that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:\n 0000 0011 0101 0111\n 0 3 5 7\n + 1001 0101 0110 1000\n <u> 9 5 6 8</u>\n = 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n\nSince BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:\n 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n + 0000 0000 0110 0110\n <u> 0 0 6 6</u>\n = 1001 1001 0010 0101\n 9 9 2 5\n\nThus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (\u2212925). To confirm the result, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 \u2212 432 should result in a negative number. The remaining nibbles are BCD, so 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 \u2212 925 = 75, so the calculated answer is \u221275.\n\nIf there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 \u2212 2), the number with the fewer digits must first be prefixed with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 \u2212 2, 2 would have to first be represented as 0002 in BCD, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0002 would have to be calculated.\n\n==Background==\nThe binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&nbsp;8421''.\n<!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal''). (where?) -->\nThe following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems. \nIn the headers to the table, the '{{code|8 4 2 1}}', indicates the weight of each bit shown; in the fifth column, \"BCD&nbsp;8&nbsp;4&nbsp;\u22122&nbsp;\u22121\", two of the weights are negative.

Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.\n\n==Comparison with pure binary==\n<!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)-->\n<!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)-->\n\n===Advantages===\n* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values. This is useful in financial calculations.\n* Scaling by a power of 10 is simple.\n* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.\n* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.\n* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see {{see section|Binary numeral system|Conversion to and from other numeral systems}}).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15 to 20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)\n* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log<sub>2</sub>10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.<!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. -->\n* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems, due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mathur|first=A.

This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.<ref>http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- also see MC6818 datasheet -->\n\nThe [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer's manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.\n\nEarly models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].\n\n==Representational variations==\nVarious BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).\n\n===Signed variations===\nSigned decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:25%\"| Type\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:55%\"| Description\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:20%\"| Example\n|-\n| Unsigned\n| No sign nibble\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>F</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing ''(canonical format)''\n| Sign nibble in the last (least significant) byte\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>C</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''\n| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte\n| <code><u>C</u>1 F2 F3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) following the digit bytes\n| <code>F1 F2 F3 <u>2B</u></code>\n|-\n| Signed leading separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) preceding the digit bytes\n| <code><u>2B</u> F1 F2 F3</code>\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|TBCD}}Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD)===\n[[3GPP]] developed '''TBCD''',<ref>{{cite techreport |title=3GPP TS 29.002: Mobile Application Part (MAP) specification |at=sec. 17.7.8 Common data types |year=2013 |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm}}</ref> an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific [[telephony]] characters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_etr/001_099/060/02_60/etr_060e02p.pdf |title=Signalling Protocols and Switching (SPS) Guidelines for using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) in telecommunication application protocols |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |title=XOM Mobile Application Part (XMAP) Specification |page=93 |access-date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221103429/http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with digits similar to those found in [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|telephone keypads]] original design.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |Decimal<br/>Digit\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |TBCD<br/>8 4 2 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |*\n| 1 0 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |#\n| 1 0 1 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |a\n| 1 1 0 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |b\n| 1 1 0 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |c\n| 1 1 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |Used as filler when there is an odd number of digits\n| 1 1 1 1\n|}\n\nThe mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte.

For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.\n\nThis representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment\u2014particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.\n\n[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays.

In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]\n\nIn [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).\n\nIn byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\"/> usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance.\n\n{{anchor|Pseudo-tetrade}}The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades''<ref name=\"Klar_1970\"/><ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}},<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/><ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\"/><ref name=\"Tietze-Schenk_2013\"/><ref name=\"Kowalski_1070\"/> ''pseudo-decimals''<ref name=\"Klar_1989\"/> or ''pseudo-decimal digit''.<ref name=\"Ferretti_2013\"/><ref name=\"Speiser_1965\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\"/>\n\nBCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetic and a slightly less dense storage.\n\nBCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]], the [[Burroughs B1700]], and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.<ref name=\"Cowlishaw_GDA\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==\nBCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is \"natural BCD\" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called \"8421\" encoding.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digit\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | BCD\n|-\n! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|}\n\nOther encodings are also used, including so-called \"4221\" and \"7421\"\u2014named after the weighting used for the bits\u2014and \"[[Excess-3]]\".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&lpg=PA20}}</ref> For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.\n\nAs most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:\n* '''Unpacked''': Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance.\n* '''Packed''': Two decimal digits are encoded into a single byte, with one digit in the least significant [[nibble]] ([[Bit numbering#Most- vs least-significant bit first|bits 0 through 3]]) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).\n\nAs an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>'''91'''</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:\n Decimal:         9         1\n Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001\n\nIn packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:\n Decimal:    9    1\n Binary : 1001 0001\n\nHence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.\n\nTo represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number <tt>'''12345'''</tt> in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:\n Decimal:    0    1    2    3    4    5\n Binary : 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101\n\nHere, the most significant nibble of the most significant byte has been encoded as zero, so the number is stored as <tt>'''012345'''</tt> (but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeros). Packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage than unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.\n\n[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.\n\n==BCD in electronics==\n{{Multiple issues|section=true|{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}}}\n\nBCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Packed BCD==\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\nIn '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.\n\nStandard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (\u2212). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).<ref name=\"IBM_POP\">{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_PDP11\">{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\">{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}</ref> ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}</ref> These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch.

Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:40%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign<br>Digit\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|BCD<br>8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:20%;\"|Sign\n! style=\"background:#e0e0e0; width:40%;\"|Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|A\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|B\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|C\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|D\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| Preferred\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|E\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|F\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''+'''\n| Unsigned\n|}\n\nNo matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')\u22121 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.\n\nFor example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from \u00b19,999,999. Thus the number \u22121,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:\n 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101\n ''1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u2212''\n\nLike character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal{{snd}} that with the most significant two digits{{snd}} is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.\n\nIn contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from \u22122,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n\nWhile packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.\n\nPacked BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the \"COMPUTATIONAL-3\" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or \"PACKED-DECIMAL\" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as \"FIXED DECIMAL\". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).\n\n[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from \u221250,000,000 to +49,999,999, and \u22121 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)\n\n===Fixed-point packed decimal===\n[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:\n 12 34 56 7C\n ''12 34.56 7+''\n\nThe decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.\n\n===Higher-density encodings===\nIf a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is greater than 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.\n\n=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==\nSome implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the \"zone\" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters \"0\" through \"9\". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).\n\nFor signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value \u2212123:\n F1 F2 D3\n '' 1 2 \u22123''\n\n===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===\n<!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. -->\n{| style=\"margin:auto;

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:\n F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0\n '' 1 2 7 9. 5 +0''\n\n{{Anchor|IBMBCD}}<!--- keep anchor with following section, \"IBM and BCD\" --->\n\n==IBM and BCD==\n{{Main|BCDIC}}\n[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].\n\nThe [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the \"12\", \"11\", and \"0\" \"zone punches\" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A \"12 zone\" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an \"11 zone\" set ''B'', and a \"0 zone\" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the \"zone\" in the even-addressed digit and the \"digit\" in the odd-addressed digit, the \"zone\" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' \"zone punches\" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nIn the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the \"zone\" in the left digit and the \"digit\" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nWith the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.\n\nOn the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.\n\nToday, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or \"pure\" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.<ref>http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Other computers and BCD==\nThe [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.<ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\"/> The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.\n\nThe [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|pages=4\u20139|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.<ref name=\"m68k\">url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf</ref>\n\nIn more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications.

Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 \u2013 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:\n 1001 + 1000 = 10001\n 9 + 8 = 17\n\n10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result, but the most-significant 1 (the \"carry\") cannot fit in a 4-bit binary number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to the total and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:\n\n 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 => 0001 0111\n 17 + 6 = 23 1 7\n\nThe two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits \"1\" and \"7\". This yields \"17\" in BCD, which is the correct result.\n\nThis technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.\n\n==Subtraction with BCD==\nSubtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]] to the [[minuend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 \u2212 432.\n\nIn signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 \u2212 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number \u2212432 can be represented. So, \u2212432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.\n\nNow that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:\n 0000 0011 0101 0111\n 0 3 5 7\n + 1001 0101 0110 1000\n <u> 9 5 6 8</u>\n = 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n\nSince BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:\n 1001 1000 1011 1111\n 9 8 11 15\n + 0000 0000 0110 0110\n <u> 0 0 6 6</u>\n = 1001 1001 0010 0101\n 9 9 2 5\n\nThus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (\u2212925). To confirm the result, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 \u2212 432 should result in a negative number. The remaining nibbles are BCD, so 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 \u2212 925 = 75, so the calculated answer is \u221275.\n\nIf there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 \u2212 2), the number with the fewer digits must first be prefixed with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 \u2212 2, 2 would have to first be represented as 0002 in BCD, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0002 would have to be calculated.\n\n==Background==\nThe binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others.

Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.\n\n==Comparison with pure binary==\n<!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)-->\n<!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)-->\n\n===Advantages===\n* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values. This is useful in financial calculations.\n* Scaling by a power of 10 is simple.\n* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.\n* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.\n* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see {{see section|Binary numeral system|Conversion to and from other numeral systems}}).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15 to 20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)\n* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log<sub>2</sub>10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.<!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. -->\n* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems, due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mathur|first=A.

This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.<ref>http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- also see MC6818 datasheet -->\n\nThe [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer's manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.\n\nEarly models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].\n\n==Representational variations==\nVarious BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).\n\n===Signed variations===\nSigned decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:25%\"| Type\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:55%\"| Description\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:20%\"| Example\n|-\n| Unsigned\n| No sign nibble\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>F</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing ''(canonical format)''\n| Sign nibble in the last (least significant) byte\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>C</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''\n| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte\n| <code><u>C</u>1 F2 F3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) following the digit bytes\n| <code>F1 F2 F3 <u>2B</u></code>\n|-\n| Signed leading separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) preceding the digit bytes\n| <code><u>2B</u> F1 F2 F3</code>\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|TBCD}}Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD)===\n[[3GPP]] developed '''TBCD''',<ref>{{cite techreport |title=3GPP TS 29.002: Mobile Application Part (MAP) specification |at=sec. 17.7.8 Common data types |year=2013 |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm}}</ref> an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific [[telephony]] characters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_etr/001_099/060/02_60/etr_060e02p.pdf |title=Signalling Protocols and Switching (SPS) Guidelines for using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) in telecommunication application protocols |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |title=XOM Mobile Application Part (XMAP) Specification |page=93 |access-date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221103429/http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with digits similar to those found in [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|telephone keypads]] original design.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |Decimal<br/>Digit\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |TBCD<br/>8 4 2 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |*\n| 1 0 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |#\n| 1 0 1 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |a\n| 1 1 0 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |b\n| 1 1 0 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |c\n| 1 1 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |Used as filler when there is an odd number of digits\n| 1 1 1 1\n|}\n\nThe mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte.

For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.\n\nThis representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment\u2014particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.\n\n[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bi-quinary coded decimal]]\n* [[Binary integer decimal]] (BID)\n* [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]\n* [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD)\n* [[Double dabble]], an algorithm for converting binary numbers to BCD\n* [[Gray code]]\n* [[Year 2000 problem]]\n* [[Decimal computer]]\n* [[Binary-coded ternary]] (BCT)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\">That is, in a standard packed 4-bit representation, there are 16 states (four bits for each digit) with 10 tetrades and 6 pseudo-tetrades, whereas in more densely packed schemes such as [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding|Chen\u2013Ho]] or [[densely packed decimal|DPD]] coding there are fewer--e.g., only 24 pseudo-tetrades in 1024 states (10 bits for three digits).</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\">{{cite web |author=Intel |title=ia32 architecture manual |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developers-manual.pdf |publisher=[[Intel]] |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\">{{cite book |title=Lexikon der Informatik und Datenverarbeitung |language=German |author-first=Hans-Jochen |author-last=Schneider |date=1986 |edition=2 |publisher=R.

Though the headquarters of the district is in [[Malappuram]], it's economy is mainly centred in the city of [[Manjeri]].\n\nThe district has contributed well to the cultural traditions of [[Kerala]]. It was the birthplace of many poets like [[Thunchath Ezhuthachan]], [[Poonthanam Nambudiri]], [[Uroob]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Moyinkutty Vaidyar]]. Besides the poets, the district has also contributed many writers, and religious and political leaders. The first Chief Minister of Kerala, [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], was born in the district. The rulers of two of the three main kingdoms of [[Kerala]] during the late medieval period had their earlier headquarters in the district- [[Perumpadappu, Malappuram|Perumpadappu]] in [[Ponnani Taluk]] was the hometown of the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], which is also known as ''Perumbadappu Swaroopam'', and [[Nediyiruppu]] in [[Kondotty Taluk]] was the earlier headquarters of the [[Zamorin of Calicut]], which is also known as ''Nediyiruppu Swaroopam''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term, ''Malappuram'', which means \"terraced place atop the hills\", is derived from the geography of [[Malappuram|Malappuram city]], the district headquarters.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malappuram}}\nBefore the district's formation, the region was known as [[Eranad]], [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Vettathunad]] etc.\n\n=== Ancient period ===\n[[File:Ruins of old jain style temple@arimbra3.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Ruins of an ancient Jain temple in [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]|Ruins of an ancient [[Jain temple]] at [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]]]\nThe district has a rich cultural and political heritage.

Among them, [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] is known as the father of modern [[Malayalam]] language. Today the district includes [[Tirunavaya]], the classic medieval centre of [[Vedas|Vedic]] learning and [[Kottakkal]], home of [[Ayurveda]] medicine. In the field of astronomy and mathematics also, Malappuram has dedicated its talented persons during the medieval period. The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|right|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers.

In 1792, [[Tipu Sultan]] was defeated by the [[East India Company]] through [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], and [[Treaty of Seringapatam]] was agreed. As per this treaty, most of the [[Malabar region]] including the present-day Malappuram district was integrated into the [[East India Company|English East India Company]]. Hence, the colonial era in the district was started. In 1800, the newly formed [[Malabar district]] by the British was integrated with the [[Madras Presidency]].\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar rebellion]] in the early 20th century. [[Wagon tragedy]] (1921) is still a saddening memory of the [[Malabar rebellion]]. It was the death of 64 prisoners on 20 November 1921 before the [[Onam]]<ref>Panikkar, K. N., ''Against Lord and State: Religion and Peasant Uprisings in Malabar 1836-1921''</ref>. The prisoners had been taken into custody following the Mappila Rebellion against the British in various parts of the district. Their deaths through apparent negligence discredited the [[British Raj]] and generated sympathy for the [[Indian independence movement]]. Wagon tragedy memorial still exists in [[Tirur]] as a historical monument. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]] in the [[Malabar district]].\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk. Of these, [[Eranad taluk|Eranad Taluk]] and [[Tirur]] remained in [[Kozhikode District]] and Perinthalmanna Taluk and Ponnani taluk remained in [[Palakkad District]]. The new district of Malappuram was formed with four taluks (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 100 [[panchayat]]s. Later, three more taluks, [[Tirurangadi taluk|Tirurangadi]], [[Nilambur taluk|Nilambur]] and [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]] were formed from Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.\n\nIn the early years of [[Communist]] rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the [[Land reform in Kerala|Land Reform Ordinance]]. During the 1970s [[Persian Gulf]] [[oil]] reserves were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers [[Kerala Gulf diaspora|migrated]] to the Gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century the region had [[First World]] health standards and near-universal literacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084273_2084272_2084259,00.html | work=Time | title=Summer Journey 2011 | date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Near cherumb eco vilalge .jpg|right|thumb|alt= The Cherumb eco-tourism village at Karuvarakundu|The Cherumb eco-tourism village in [[Karuvarakundu]]]]\nBounded by the [[Nilgiri Mountains|Nilgiri hills]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, the [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]] and [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] districts on the north, and the [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] and [[Thrissur district|Thrissur]] districts on the south, Malappuram district possesses a total geographical area of 3,554 sq.km, which ranks third in the state in terms of area.

Today it is the third-largest district in [[Kerala]] in terms of area.\n\nMalappuram district was carved out by combining some portions of the former Palakkad and Kozhikode districts- [[Eranad taluk]] and portions of [[Tirur taluk]] in the former [[Kozhikode district]], and portions of [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] and [[Ponnani taluk]] in the former [[Palakkad district]] (before 1969). Now the district comprises seven Taluks- [[Ponnani taluk|Ponnani]], [[Perinthalmanna taluk|Perinthalmanna]], [[Tirur Taluk|Tirur]], [[Eranad Taluk|Eranad]], [[Tirurangadi Taluk Office|Tirurangadi]], [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]], and [[Nilambur]].  [[Malayalam]] is the most widely spoken language of the district. Though the headquarters of the district is in [[Malappuram]], it's economy is mainly centred in the city of [[Manjeri]].\n\nThe district has contributed well to the cultural traditions of [[Kerala]]. It was the birthplace of many poets like [[Thunchath Ezhuthachan]], [[Poonthanam Nambudiri]], [[Uroob]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Moyinkutty Vaidyar]]. Besides the poets, the district has also contributed many writers, and religious and political leaders. The first Chief Minister of Kerala, [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], was born in the district. The rulers of two of the three main kingdoms of [[Kerala]] during the late medieval period had their earlier headquarters in the district- [[Perumpadappu, Malappuram|Perumpadappu]] in [[Ponnani Taluk]] was the hometown of the [[Kingdom of Cochin]], which is also known as ''Perumbadappu Swaroopam'', and [[Nediyiruppu]] in [[Kondotty Taluk]] was the earlier headquarters of the [[Zamorin of Calicut]], which is also known as ''Nediyiruppu Swaroopam''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term, ''Malappuram'', which means \"terraced place atop the hills\", is derived from the geography of [[Malappuram|Malappuram city]], the district headquarters.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malappuram}}\nBefore the district's formation, the region was known as [[Eranad]], [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Vettathunad]] etc.\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n[[File:Ruins of old jain style temple@arimbra3.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Ruins of an ancient Jain temple in [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]|Ruins of an ancient [[Jain temple]] at [[Arimbra Hills, Malappuram|Arimbra]]]]\nThe district has a rich cultural and political heritage. The Stone Age history of the district is not well-known. However, the remains of some pre-historic symbols like [[Dolmen|Dolmens]], [[Menhir|Menhirs]], and [[Rock-cut architecture|Rock-cut caves]] have been found from various places of the district like [[Nilambur]], [[Manjeri]], etc. [[Rock-cut architecture|Rock-cut caves]] are also seen in the places like Puliyakkode,  [[Chemmad|Thrikkulam]],  [[Oorakam]],  [[Melmuri]],  [[Ponmala]],  [[Vallikunnu]], and  [[Vengara, Malappuram District|Vengara]].<ref name=History_of_Malappuram>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/3205_PART_A_MALAPPURAM.pdf |website=censusindia.gov.in |title= History of Malappuram |accessdate= 17 April 2020}}</ref> The port of [[Ponnani]] (known as [[Tyndis]] in the ancient period) was a center of trade with [[Ancient Rome]]. During [[Sangam period]], the region was included in the Kudanadu, a province in the [[Tamilakam|Ancient Tamilakam]].\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Thirunavaya (5).jpg|left|thumb|alt=Thirunavaya Navamukunda temple|[[Thirunavaya Navamukunda Temple]], where the [[Mamankam festival]] was held during the [[Zamorin of Calicut|Zamorin's rule]]]]\nAfter the Chera Dynasty, a number of dynasties controlled the area, and by the ninth century the region was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty|Kulasekharas]] of [[Mahodayapuram]]. A piece of inscriptional evidence found at the [[Triprangode Siva Temple]] indicates that [[Goda Ravi]] of [[Chera Dynasty]] controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of [[Eranad|Eranad region]] can be seen in the [[Jewish copper plates of Cochin|Jewish copper plates]] of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 CE) and in the [[Viraraghava copper plates]] of  Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 CE). <ref name=History_of_Malappuram></ref> After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom, a number of [[Nair]] city-states emerged, including [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Vettattunadu (Tanur)]], [[Parappanad]] and [[Nediyiruppu]] (ruled by the [[Zamorin]]s). \n\nDuring the 14th century, the [[Samoothiri]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] expanded their territories to many parts of the district. [[Thirunavaya]], the seat of [[Mamankam]], is located at the present-day [[Tirur Taluk]] in Malappuram district.Thrikkavil Kovilakam in [[Ponnani]] served as a second home for the Samoothiris of Kozhikode. The Samoothiri of Kozhikode earned a greater part of his revenues by taxing the spice trade through his ports.

Among them, [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] is known as the father of modern [[Malayalam]] language.

The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial-era ===\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers. When [[William Keeling]], a sea captain of [[East India Company]] arrived at [[Zamorin of Calicut|Kingdom of Calicut]] in 1615, he got the permission to start warehouses in the coastal city of [[Ponnani]], through a treaty signed with the then [[Zamorin of Calicut]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/136015/9/09_chapter%202.pdf |website=shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in |title= European treaties of Malappuram |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>  During the 18th century, the ''de facto'' [[Mysore kingdom]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] marched into the Zamorin\u2019s kingdom. In 1792, [[Tipu Sultan]] was defeated by the [[East India Company]] through [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]], and [[Treaty of Seringapatam]] was agreed. As per this treaty, most of the [[Malabar region]] including the present-day Malappuram district was integrated into the [[East India Company]]. Hence, the colonial era in the district was started. In 1800, the newly formed [[Malabar district]] by the British was integrated with the [[Madras Presidency]].\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar Rebellion]] in the early 20th century. Before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947, Malappuram was part of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]]. \n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|right|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n\n=== After Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place in between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk. Of these, [[Eranad taluk|Eranad Taluk]] and [[Tirur]] remained in [[Kozhikode District]] and Perinthalmanna Taluk and Ponnani taluk remained in [[Palakkad District]]. The new district of Malappuram was formed with four taluks (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 100 [[panchayat]]s. Later, three more taluks, [[Tirurangadi taluk|Tirurangadi]], [[Nilambur taluk|Nilambur]] and [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]] were formed from Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.\n\nIn the early years of [[Communist]] rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the [[Land reform in Kerala|Land Reform Ordinance]]. During the 1970s [[Persian Gulf]] [[oil]] reserves were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers [[Kerala Gulf diaspora|migrated]] to the Gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century the region had [[First World]] health standards and near-universal literacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084273_2084272_2084259,00.html | work=Time | title=Summer Journey 2011 | date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cherumb eco tourism village, Karuvarakundu India (2).JPG|right|thumb|alt= The Cherumb eco-tourism village at Karuvarakundu|The Cherumb eco-tourism village in [[Karuvarakundu]]]]\nBounded by the [[Nilgiri Mountains|Nilgiri hills]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, the [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]] and [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] districts on the north, and the [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] and [[Thrissur district|Thrissur]] districts on the south, Malappuram district possesses a total geographical area of 3,554 sq.km, which ranks third in the state in terms of area. The district possesses 9.15% of the total area of the state. The district is located at 75\u00b0E - 77\u00b0E longitude and 10\u00b0N - 12\u00b0N latitude in the geographical map. Similar to the other parts of [[Kerala]], the Malappuram district also has a coastal area (lowland) bounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] at the west, a midland at the centre, and a hilly area (highland), bounded by the [[Western Ghats]] at the east.\n\nEranad and Perinthalmanna Talukas are located in the midland.
