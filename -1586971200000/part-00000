The story follows [[Mario]]'s quest to save [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] and his minions, the [[Koopalings]]. The [[gameplay]] is similar to that of earlier ''[[Super Mario]]'' games: Players control Mario or his brother [[Luigi]] through a series of [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in which the goal is to reach the [[flagpole]] at the end. ''Super Mario World'' introduced [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of [[Koopa Troopa]]s.\n\n[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] developed the game, led by director [[Takashi Tezuka]] and producer and series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It is the first ''Mario'' game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console's technical features. The development team had more freedom compared to the series installments for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until ''Super Mario World'' due to [[Computer hardware|hardware]] limitations.\n\n''Super Mario World'' is often considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the [[best-selling SNES game]]. It also led to an [[Super Mario World (TV series)|animated television series of the same name]] and a prequel, ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', released in August and October 1995. It has been rereleased on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation ''[[Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World]]'' for the SNES and was rereleased for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2'' in 2001, on the [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[New Nintendo 3DS]] consoles, and as part of the [[Super NES Classic Edition]]. It was also released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] through [[Nintendo Switch Online]] using the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app. It is also a course style in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Supermarioworld.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mario]] riding [[Yoshi]] during the game's second [[Level (gaming)|level]].

The game has similar [[gameplay]] to earlier games in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series\u2014''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''\u2014but introduces new elements. As well as running and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of certain power-ups and can execute the new spin jump move.<ref name=\"allgame\"/> The game has 96 [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in total.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\">{{Cite video game |title=Super Mario World |developer=[[Nintendo EAD]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=21 November 1990 |platform=[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] |language=English}}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |title=Super Mario World Instruction Booklet |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615195341/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=31 August 1991 |archivedate=15 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe player navigates through the game via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a side-scrolling playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress allows access to that level's playfield. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies.<ref name=jeux/> The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=11}} The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting \"[[Glossary of video game terms#C|Continue]]\".{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}} Each world features a final stage with a [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the [[Koopalings]],{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=19}} and the player also battles [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] in his castle in the seventh and final world.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=20}} ''Super Mario World'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] option that allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second controls his brother, [[Luigi]].{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=9}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nIn addition to the [[power-up]]s from previous games, such as the [[Super Mushroom]] and [[Fire Flower]], new power-ups that provide new gameplay options are also introduced. The new power-up in the game is the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=15-16}} The game also introduces the ability to \"store\" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nThe game introduces [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=119}} If Yoshi attempts to eat a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] or its shell, he can spit it and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies, causing the baby Yoshi to mature.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nAlthough the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find key scattered throughout the game's levels.<ref name=usgamer/> When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=21}} Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n==Plot==\nAfter saving the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] decide to go on vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] is captured by Bowser. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopalings. Mario and Luigi soon realise that it must be the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser Koopa]] and his [[Koopalings]]. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Toadstool and Yoshi's dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey. Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser, defeating the Koopalings in the process, and save Yoshi's dinosaur friends. They eventually arrive at Bowser's castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Takashi Tezuka, Shigeru Miyamoto and K\u014dji Kond\u014d (cropped 3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''From left'': Director [[Takashi Tezuka]], producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], and composer [[Koji Kondo]], pictured in 2015|alt=An image of the three integral staff who worked on the game. From left to right is director Takashi Tezuka, producer Shigeru Miyamoto, and composer [[Koji Kondo]].]]\nThe game was directed by [[Takashi Tezuka]], while [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of both ''Super Mario'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', served as producer. [[Shigefumi Hino]] took the role of graphics designer. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] handled development with a team of ten people including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros]]''. In a retrospective interview, the core team said that Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=28}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was the first ''Mario'' game series developed for the then-upcoming [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29}} Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain [[game mechanics|mechanics]] such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported ''Super Mario 3'' to the SNES and it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29-30}}\n\nMiyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since ''Super Mario Bros.'', but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).<ref name=\"history\"/>{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=31}} The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game ''[[Devil World]]'' which shared many similarities with Yoshi.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=118}} During the development of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse.{{sfn|''Nintendo Power'' staff|1991|p=32}} As development of ''Super Mario World'' progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches.<ref name=\"yoshi\">{{cite web |last1=Corrigan |first1=Hope |title=Super Mario World: Mario Was Originally Punching Yoshi in The Head |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930194553/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |archivedate=30 September 2017 |date=28 September 2017}}</ref> Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character.<ref name=yoshi/> Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as [[Country music|country and western]] themes, influenced Yoshi's creation.{{sfn|East|2012|p=52}}\n\nReflecting on how he had created different melodies for ''Super Mario Bros 3.'', composer [[Koji Kondo]] decided to reuse the same themes for ''Super Mario World'', albeit in a [[Arrangement|rearranged]] form. By doing this, he assumed that players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As ''Super Mario World'' was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, often implementing them all one after the other in the game's title song.<ref name=\"kondo5\">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: Music Commentary by Koji Kondo (2) |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Super-Mario-All-Stars/Vol-1-Super-Mario-History-Soundtrack-CD/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2-/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2--220040.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |page=5}}</ref> As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional [[square wave]]s and [[triangle wave]]s had \"gained acceptance\" with consumers. For the game's sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments as opposed to square waves to emphasise the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials.<ref name=kondo5/> It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=36}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was produced during the [[Glossary of video game terms#C|console wars]]\u2014a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and [[Sega]]'s two-year-old [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] system\u2014which led to fierce competition between the two companies.<ref name=history/>{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=431}} Sega's mascot, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], was seen by many as a faster and \"cooler\" alternative to Mario.

Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The story follows [[Mario]]'s quest to save [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] and his minions, the [[Koopalings]]. The [[gameplay]] is similar to that of earlier ''[[Super Mario]]'' games: Players control Mario or his brother [[Luigi]] through a series of [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in which the goal is to reach the [[flagpole]] at the end. ''Super Mario World'' introduced [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of [[Koopa Troopa]]s.\n\n[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] developed the game, led by director [[Takashi Tezuka]] and producer and series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It is the first ''Mario'' game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console's technical features. The development team had more freedom compared to the series installments for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until ''Super Mario World'' due to [[Computer hardware|hardware]] limitations.\n\n''Super Mario World'' is often considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the [[best-selling SNES game]]. It also led to an [[Super Mario World (TV series)|animated television series of the same name]] and a prequel, ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', released in August and October 1995. It has been rereleased on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation ''[[Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World]]'' for the SNES and was rereleased for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2'' in 2001, on the [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[New Nintendo 3DS]] consoles, and as part of the [[Super NES Classic Edition]]. It was also released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] through [[Nintendo Switch Online]] using the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app. It is also a course style in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Supermarioworld.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mario]] riding [[Yoshi]] during the game's second [[Level (gaming)|level]].

The game has similar [[gameplay]] to earlier games in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series\u2014''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''\u2014but introduces new elements. As well as running and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of certain power-ups and can execute the new spin jump move.<ref name=\"allgame\"/> The game has 96 [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in total.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\">{{Cite video game |title=Super Mario World |developer=[[Nintendo EAD]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=21 November 1990 |platform=[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] |language=English}}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |title=Super Mario World Instruction Booklet |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615195341/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=31 August 1991 |archivedate=15 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe player navigates through the game via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a side-scrolling playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress allows access to that level's playfield. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies.<ref name=jeux/> The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=11}} The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting \"[[Glossary of video game terms#C|Continue]]\".{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}} Each world features a final stage with a [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the [[Koopalings]],{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=19}} and the player also battles [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] in his castle in the seventh and final world.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=20}} ''Super Mario World'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] option that allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second controls his brother, [[Luigi]].{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=9}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nIn addition to the [[power-up]]s from previous games, such as the [[Super Mushroom]] and [[Fire Flower]], new power-ups that provide new gameplay options are also introduced. The new power-up in the game is the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=15-16}} The game also introduces the ability to \"store\" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nThe game introduces [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=119}} If Yoshi attempts to eat a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] or its shell, he can spit it and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies, causing the baby Yoshi to mature.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nAlthough the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find key scattered throughout the game's levels.<ref name=usgamer/> When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=21}} Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n==Plot==\nAfter saving the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] decide to go on vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas. Mario and Luigi soon realise that it must be the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser Koopa]] and his [[Koopalings]]. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Toadstool and Yoshi's dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey. Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser, defeating the Koopalings in the process, and save Yoshi's dinosaur friends. They eventually arrive at Bowser's castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Takashi Tezuka, Shigeru Miyamoto and K\u014dji Kond\u014d (cropped 3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''From left'': Director [[Takashi Tezuka]], producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], and composer [[Koji Kondo]], pictured in 2015|alt=An image of the three integral staff who worked on the game.

[[Shigefumi Hino]] took the role of graphics designer. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] handled development with a team of ten people including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros]]''.

As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29}} Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain [[game mechanics|mechanics]] such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported ''Super Mario 3'' to the SNES and it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29-30}}\n\nMiyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since ''Super Mario Bros.'', but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).<ref name=\"history\"/>{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=31}} The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game ''[[Devil World]]'' which shared many similarities with Yoshi.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=118}} During the development of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse.{{sfn|''Nintendo Power'' staff|1991|p=32}} As development of ''Super Mario World'' progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches.<ref name=\"yoshi\">{{cite web |last1=Corrigan |first1=Hope |title=Super Mario World: Mario Was Originally Punching Yoshi in The Head |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930194553/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |archivedate=30 September 2017 |date=28 September 2017}}</ref> Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character.<ref name=yoshi/> Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as [[Country music|country and western]] themes, influenced Yoshi's creation.{{sfn|East|2012|p=52}}\n\nReflecting on how he had created different melodies for ''Super Mario Bros 3.'', composer [[Koji Kondo]] decided to reuse the same themes for ''Super Mario World'', albeit in a [[Arrangement|rearranged]] form. By doing this, he assumed that players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As ''Super Mario World'' was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, often implementing them all one after the other in the game's title song.<ref name=\"kondo5\">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: Music Commentary by Koji Kondo (2) |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Super-Mario-All-Stars/Vol-1-Super-Mario-History-Soundtrack-CD/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2-/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2--220040.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |page=5}}</ref> As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional [[square wave]]s and [[triangle wave]]s had \"gained acceptance\" with consumers. For the game's sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments as opposed to square waves to emphasise the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials.<ref name=kondo5/> It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=36}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was produced during the [[Glossary of video game terms#C|console wars]]\u2014a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and [[Sega]]'s two-year-old [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] system\u2014which led to fierce competition between the two companies.<ref name=history/>{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=431}} Sega's mascot, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], was seen by many as a faster and \"cooler\" alternative to Mario.

PQDIF can be used to represent other power related measurement data and is extensible to other data types as well.
