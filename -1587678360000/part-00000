Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[Love song|slow ballads]] and [[dance-pop|up-tempo]] tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with [[Ben Margulies]], which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Tommy Mottola]]. ''Mariah Carey'' featured production and writing from [[Rhett Lawrence]], [[Ric Wake]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]], all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.\n\nReviews of the album generally complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. ''Mariah Carey'' was certified nine-times [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine&nbsp;million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times [[List of music recording certifications|Platinum]]. ''Mariah Carey'' fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 20 million copies making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. \"[[Vision of Love]]\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. The album's second single, \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" was also well received and topped the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" and \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since [[The Jackson 5]] to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Carey moved out of her mother's house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan.<ref name=\"nick\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=20}}</ref> She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name=\"nick\"/> As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo.<ref name=\"nick2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=22}}</ref> After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer [[Brenda K. Starr]], and soon began singing back-up for her.<ref name=\"nick2\"/> Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as \"glimpses\" of Carey's voice throughout sessions, and noticed her \"gifted voice\".<ref name=\"nick3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=23}}</ref> She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.<ref name=\"nick3\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I really didn't want to do it, but I said its gotta be better than what I'm doing now. So I went to the audition, and Brenda was such a great person.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on auditioning for her position as back-up with Starr<ref name=\"nick2\"/>\n }}\nOne night, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala, attempting to convince a record label executive to listen her demo.<ref name=\"nick4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> [[Jerry L. Greenberg]], president of [[Atlantic Records]] took notice of her.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Carey handed him the record, [[Tommy Mottola]] quickly grabbed the tape, insisting that he would deal with \"the project\".<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Mottola got into his limousine later that evening, he played Carey's demo and quickly realized the talent that he had just discovered. He quickly returned to the event, but a discouraged Carey had already left.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=27%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"For this particular time, she is my number one priority. We don't look at her as a dance-pop artist.

Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n\n==Recording and composition==\n{{listen\n | pos          = right\n | filename     = Mariah Carey - I don't wanna cry(1).ogg\n | title        = \"I Don't Wanna Cry\"\n | description  = A sample of the song, featuring the yearning lyrics and tempo Carey incorporated with Walden.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n\n | pos2         = right\n | filename2    = All in Your Mind.ogg\n | title2       = \"All in Your Mind\"\n | description2 = A sample of the song, featuring the vocal flip Carey described as a highlight during the album's recording.\n | format2      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"When we met she was 17 years old and I was 24.

While he described Carey as \"very shy,\" he noted how professional she was for someone her age.<ref name=\"nick6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=28}}</ref> Additionally, Carey wrote \"There's Got to Be a Way\" during her first recording session with Wake.<ref name=\"nick7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=29}}</ref> During the session, they wrote four songs, but they only produced the latter song for the album. After flying to New York and working with Carey, Walden was astonished by her voice.<ref name=\"nick7\"/> Together, they collaborated on transforming many of the demo's songs into more commercial recordings, which took place in Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, California.<ref name=\"nick8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=30}}</ref> For her work with Lawrence, Carey traveled to New York once again. In the studio, she presented him with the demo of \"Vision of Love\" which she had written with Margulies years prior. Lawrence saw \"potential\" in the song, but he did not think much of it in its early stages.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> He described the song's sound as having a \"fifties sort of shuffle\".<ref name=\"nick8\"/> According to Lawrence, Carey needed a more contemporary sound, so they met in the studio alongside Margulies and producer Chris Toland. They added a new arrangement to the original [[chord progression]], while Carey changed the song's melody and [[key (music)|key]]. Afterwards, Margulies added few drum [[Musical note|note]]s to the arrangement, including additional [[guitar]] and [[bass drum|bass]] notes.<ref name=\"nick8\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I was using my upper register...what happened was at the end of it, I did these vocal flips. When I was doing it, my voice split and went into a harmony. If you hear it, it splits. I was saying, 'Get rid of that,' but everyone was saying 'No way, we're keeping that'.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on the high notes she hit while experimenting with her voice in the studio<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n }}\nWhen Carey worked with Walden on \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", they worked on several other songs.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> Together, they decided to \"slow down the tempo\" and create a \"crying type of ballad,\" one which according to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> After they completed the song, Lawrence noted how much of a perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct \"one line\" that troubled her.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" became Wake's favorite from the start, \"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\"<ref name=\"nick9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=31}}</ref> During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> In \"All in Your Mind\", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing [[staccato]]s up to F7.<ref>[http://www.divalegacy.com/php/main_pages.php?CategoryID=3&AuthorID=3&ID=18 The Acuto Sfogato]</ref> According to the artist, her voice \"split\" while doing those [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].<ref name=\"nick10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=32}}</ref> While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n\nThe debut album was completed and being mastered when Carey wrote \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for [[Columbia Records]] president [[Don Ienner]]. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and [[Bobby Colomby]].\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.\n\nThe demo was sent to producer Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.  \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\n\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\n\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\"\n\nOn the first copies of the album that were printed, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc liner notes, even though the song was on the cassette or CD itself.  \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\"<ref>[http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml#ltt \"Hero\" inside story<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622140004/http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml |date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nAside from the heavy marketing and promotional campaign held by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], Carey performed on several television programs and award ceremonies, stateside and throughout Europe.

As noted by Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] in his book, ''Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture,'' Carey's \"refusal to bow to public pressure\" surrounding the nature of her ethnicity exposed \"the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorisation\" and \"the racial contradictions at the centre of contemporary pop music\" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/pop-view-black-or-white-labels-don-t-always-fit.html|title=POP VIEW; Black or White?

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[Love song|slow ballads]] and [[dance-pop|up-tempo]] tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with [[Ben Margulies]], which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Tommy Mottola]]. ''Mariah Carey'' featured production and writing from [[Rhett Lawrence]], [[Ric Wake]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]], all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.\n\nReviews of the album generally complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. ''Mariah Carey'' was certified nine-times [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine&nbsp;million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times [[List of music recording certifications|Platinum]]. ''Mariah Carey'' fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 20 million copies making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. \"[[Vision of Love]]\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. The album's second single, \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" was also well received and topped the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" and \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since [[The Jackson 5]] to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Carey moved out of her mother's house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan.<ref name=\"nick\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=20}}</ref> She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name=\"nick\"/> As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo.<ref name=\"nick2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=22}}</ref> After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer [[Brenda K. Starr]], and soon began singing back-up for her.<ref name=\"nick2\"/> Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as \"glimpses\" of Carey's voice throughout sessions, and noticed her \"gifted voice\".<ref name=\"nick3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=23}}</ref> She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.<ref name=\"nick3\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I really didn't want to do it, but I said its gotta be better than what I'm doing now. So I went to the audition, and Brenda was such a great person.\"|source=\u2014Carey, on auditioning for her position as back-up with Starr<ref name=\"nick2\"/>\n }}\nOne night, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala, attempting to convince a record label executive to listen her demo.<ref name=\"nick4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> [[Jerry L. Greenberg]], president of [[Atlantic Records]] took notice of her.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Carey handed him the record, [[Tommy Mottola]] quickly grabbed the tape, insisting that he would deal with \"the project\".<ref name=\"nick4\"/> As Mottola got into his limousine later that evening, he played Carey's demo and quickly realized the talent that he had just discovered. He quickly returned to the event, but a discouraged Carey had already left.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=27%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=\"For this particular time, she is my number one priority. We don't look at her as a dance-pop artist. We look at her as a franchise.\"|source=\u2014[[Don Ienner]], president of Columbia Records, on his plans for working with Carey<ref name=\"nick5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=27}}</ref>\n }}\nAfter a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"nick4\"/> After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.<ref name=\"nick4\"/>\n\nMottola had assumed the top position at [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through various stages of change.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> One he felt was very important for the label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival [[Whitney Houston]] from [[Arista Records]], or a pop star to match [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who was signed to [[Sire Records]] at the time.<ref name=\"nick4\"/> He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material.

While he described Carey as \"very shy,\" he noted how professional she was for someone her age.<ref name=\"nick6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=28}}</ref> Additionally, Carey wrote \"There's Got to Be a Way\" during her first recording session with Wake.<ref name=\"nick7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=29}}</ref> During the session, they wrote four songs, but they only produced the latter song for the album. After flying to New York and working with Carey, Walden was astonished by her voice.<ref name=\"nick7\"/> Together, they collaborated on transforming many of the demo's songs into more commercial recordings, which took place in Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, California.<ref name=\"nick8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=30}}</ref> For her work with Lawrence, Carey traveled to New York once again. In the studio, she presented him with the demo of \"Vision of Love\" which she had written with Margulies years prior. Lawrence saw \"potential\" in the song, but he did not think much of it in its early stages.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> He described the song's sound as having a \"fifties sort of shuffle\".<ref name=\"nick8\"/> According to Lawrence, Carey needed a more contemporary sound, so they met in the studio alongside Margulies and producer Chris Toland. They added a new arrangement to the original [[chord progression]], while Carey changed the song's melody and [[key (music)|key]]. Afterwards, Margulies added few drum [[Musical note|note]]s to the arrangement, including additional [[guitar]] and [[bass drum|bass]] notes.<ref name=\"nick8\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=31%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"I was using my upper register...what happened was at the end of it, I did these vocal flips. When I was doing it, my voice split and went into a harmony. If you hear it, it splits.

He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct \"one line\" that troubled her.<ref name=\"nick8\"/> As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]\" became Wake's favorite from the start, \"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\"<ref name=\"nick9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=31}}</ref> During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody.<ref name=\"nick9\"/> In \"All in Your Mind\", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing [[staccato]]s up to F7.<ref>[http://www.divalegacy.com/php/main_pages.php?CategoryID=3&AuthorID=3&ID=18 The Acuto Sfogato]</ref> According to the artist, her voice \"split\" while doing those [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].<ref name=\"nick10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=32}}</ref> While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.<ref name=\"nick10\"/>\n\nThe debut album was completed and being mastered when Carey wrote \"[[Love Takes Time]]\" with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for [[Columbia Records]] president [[Don Ienner]]. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and [[Bobby Colomby]].\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.\n\nThe demo was sent to producer Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.  \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\n\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\n\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\"\n\nOn the first copies of the album that were printed, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc liner notes, even though the song was on the cassette or CD itself.  \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\"<ref>[http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml#ltt \"Hero\" inside story<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622140004/http://www.mariahdaily.com/infozone/storybehindno1s.shtml |date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nAside from the heavy marketing and promotional campaign held by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], Carey performed on several television programs and award ceremonies, stateside and throughout Europe.

Writing for [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]], Elena Bergeron described the record as \"the album that launched a million runs\", stating that it \"gave an entire generation of would-be divas something to sing into their hairbrushes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/best-90s-r-and-b-albums/|title=The 50 Best R&B Albums of the '90s|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> R&B singer [[Beyonc\u00e9]] said that she began doing vocal \"runs\" after listening to \"Vision of Love\" for the first time, stating that it inspired her to follow a path into the music industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/03/on-top|title=On Top|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|date=2006-03-27|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> Christina Aguilera has also stated how Carey's album had the biggest influence on her vocal stylings and delivery. According to the Pier Dominguez, author of ''Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made'', Carey's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera, whose influence also stemmed from the fact that both were of mixed heritage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/christinaaguiler0000domi|title=Christina Aguilera : a star is made : the unauthorized biography|last=Dominguez|first=Pier|date=2003|publisher=Phoenix : Colossus Books|others=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nCarey's two wins at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards]] was also commented upon by critics, particularly in regards to the lip-syncing controversy surrounding [[Milli Vanilli]] the prior year. Speaking to the press after winning [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], Carey stated: \"With all the controversy surrounding this award, I hope to bring it back to a real singer-songwriter category, where everyone else following me can be as proud as I am to receive this honor\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Mariah Carey- Grammy Awards press room Interview (1991)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF1cHRR8BSU|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The singer's performance of \"Vision of Love\" at the ceremony has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest award show performances of all time. Andrew Unterberger of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] described it as showcasing Carey \"in full beast mode, tracing her unprecedented vocal runs with her hands and occasionally running out of room in the process; not excessively showy but unafraid of demonstrating\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7677099/best-award-show-performances-of-all-time|title=The 100 Greatest Award Show Performances of All Time|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Unterberger further commented on Carey's exposure to the wider pop landscape following her debut at the award show, commenting on how \"Mariah's self-titled debut LP shot to the top of the Billboard 200 and stayed there for 11 weeks\" in the wake of her appearance. \n\nThe singer's outspokenness about her own multi-racial heritage at the time of her debut's release has also been commented upon by both music critics and sociologists alike. As noted by Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] in his book, ''Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture,'' Carey's \"refusal to bow to public pressure\" surrounding the nature of her ethnicity exposed \"the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorisation\" and \"the racial contradictions at the centre of contemporary pop music\" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/pop-view-black-or-white-labels-don-t-always-fit.html|title=POP VIEW; Black or White?

He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated [[Tall tale|tales]] that he told about his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation, along with his own stories.\n\nHickok was born and raised on a farm in northern [[Illinois]] at a time when lawlessness and [[vigilante]] activity were occurring because of the influence of the \"[[Banditti of the Prairie]]\". Hickok was drawn to this ruffian lifestyle and headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a [[stagecoach]] driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]]. He fought and spied for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] and gained publicity after the war as a scout, [[marksman]], actor, and professional gambler. Over the course of his life, he was involved in several notable shoot-outs.\n\nIn 1876, Hickok was shot from behind and killed while playing [[poker]] in a [[Bar|saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]] (present-day [[South Dakota]]) by [[Jack McCall]], an unsuccessful gambler and wannabe assasin. The hand of cards which he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the [[dead man's hand]]: two pair, black aces and eights.\n\nHickok remains a popular figure in frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been [[List of cultural depictions of Wild Bill Hickok|depicted numerous times]] in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and most of his career was exaggerated by both himself and various mythmakers.

Originally published in ''Wild West''.</ref> Hickok was buried in the Ingelside Cemetery, Deadwood's original graveyard. This cemetery filled quickly, and in 1879, on the third anniversary of Hickcock's original burial, Utter paid to move Hickok's remains to the new [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]].{{efn|group=\"notes\"|The old cemetery was in an area that was better suited for the constant influx of new settlers to live on, so the remaining bodies there were eventually also moved up the hill to the Mount Moriah Cemetery (in the 1880s).}} Utter supervised the move and noted that, while perfectly preserved, Hickok had been imperfectly embalmed. As a result, [[calcium carbonate]] from the surrounding soil had replaced the flesh, leading to [[petrifaction]]. One of the workers, Joseph McLintock, wrote a detailed description of the re-interment. McLintock used a cane to tap the body, face, and head, finding no soft tissue anywhere. He noted that the sound was similar to tapping a brick wall and believed the remains weighed more than {{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. William Austin, the cemetery caretaker, estimated {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, which made it difficult for the men to carry the remains to the new site. The original wooden grave marker was moved to the new site, but by 1891 it had been destroyed by souvenir hunters whittling pieces from it, and it was replaced with a statue. This, in turn, was destroyed by souvenir hunters and replaced in 1902 by a life-sized sandstone sculpture of Hickok. This, too, was badly defaced, and was then enclosed in a cage for protection. The enclosure was cut open by souvenir hunters in the 1950s, and the statue was removed.<ref>Rosa, Joseph G. (1979). ''They Called Him Wild Bill''.

Over the course of his life, he was involved in several notable shoot-outs.\n\nIn 1876, Hickok was shot from behind and killed while playing [[poker]] in a [[Bar|saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]] (present-day [[South Dakota]]) by [[Jack McCall]], an unsuccessful gambler. The hand of cards which he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the [[dead man's hand]]: two pair, black aces and eights.\n\nHickok remains a popular figure in frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been [[List of cultural depictions of Wild Bill Hickok|depicted numerous times]] in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and most of his career was exaggerated by both himself and various mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have killed numerous named and unnamed gunmen in his lifetime, according to [[Joseph G. Rosa]], Hickok's biographer and the foremost authority on Wild Bill, Hickok killed only six or seven men in gunfights.<ref name=\"True\">{{cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/how-many-men-did-wild-bill-hickok-actually-kill/|title=How many men did Wild Bill Hickok actually kill?|website=[[True West Magazine]]|author=Trimble, Marshall}} April 1, 2002</ref><ref>Rosa, Joseph G.

This, in turn, was destroyed by souvenir hunters and replaced in 1902 by a life-sized sandstone sculpture of Hickok. This, too, was badly defaced, and was then enclosed in a cage for protection. The enclosure was cut open by souvenir hunters in the 1950s, and the statue was removed.<ref>Rosa, Joseph G. (1979). ''They Called Him Wild Bill''.

The lunar phases gradually change over the period of a [[Lunar por los cacos en el mundo \ud83d\ude00month#Synodic month|synodic month]] (about 29.53 days), as the [[orbit]]al positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the [[Sun]] shift.\n\nThe Moon's rotation is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] by Earth's [[gravity]]; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth. This [[near side of the Moon|near side]] is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]]. Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at [[new moon]]) to 100% (at [[full moon]]). The [[terminator (solar)#Lunar terminator|lunar terminator]] is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.\n\nEach of the four \"intermediate\" lunar phases (see below) is around 7.4 [[day]]s, but this [[orbital eccentricity|varies slightly]] due to the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some [[lunar craters|craters]] near the lunar poles, such as [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]], all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of [[daylight]], followed by 14.77 days of \"[[night]]\". (The [[far side of the Moon|side of the Moon]] facing away from Earth is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", although that is a [[misnomer]]).\n\n<br />\n\n==Phases of the Moon==\n{{redirect|Waxing gibbous|the album|Waxing Gibbous}}\n[[File:Moon phases en.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The phases of the Moon as viewed looking southward from the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

These are the instances when the Moon's [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] and the Sun's [[ecliptic]] longitude differ by 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0, respectively.{{efn|Strictly, the quarter phases happen when the observer\u2013Moon\u2013Sun angle is 90\u00b0, also known as [[quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]]. This is not exactly the same as having the Sun\u2013observer\u2013Moon angle a right-angle, but the difference is very slight.}} Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon's apparent shape is either [[crescent]] or [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]]. These shapes, and the periods when the Moon shows them, are called the ''intermediate phases'' and last one-quarter of a [[synodic month]], or 7.38 days, on average. However, their durations [[orbital eccentricity|vary slightly]] because the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is rather [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]], so the satellite's [[orbital speed]] is not constant. The descriptor ''waxing'' is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to full moon, and ''waning'' when the shape is thinning.\n\nThe eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:\n\n<center>\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Principal and intermediate phases of the Moon\n!

As the Moon ''waxes'' (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]] moon, and full moon. The Moon is then said to ''wane'' as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon. The terms ''old moon'' and ''new moon'' are not interchangeable. The \"old moon\" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Astronomy Lesson 7 - The Phases of the Moon |url=http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/moon2.html |website=Synapses.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref> ''Half moon'' is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term ''quarter'' refers to the extent of the Moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.\n\nWhen an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an [[ellipse]] and circle (in which the ellipse's [[major axis]] coincides with the circle's diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards),<ref>Origin: 1350\u20131400; Middle English < Latin ''gibb\u014dsus''  humped, equivalent to ''gibb'' \"(a) hump\" + ''-\u014dsus'' \"-ous\"; {{cite web |title=Gibbous |work=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gibbous}}</ref> whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a [[crescent]]. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=CNN |first1=Leah Asmelash and David Allan |title=A black moon is coming on July 31. Here's what that means |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/us/black-moon-trnd-scn/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>\n\n===Orientation by latitude===\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if the left (east) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as [[wikt:wax|waxing]] (shifting toward full moon). If the right (west) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)\n\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180\u00b0, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.\n\nCloser to the [[Equator]], the [[lunar terminator]] will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at [[middle latitude|middle]] or [[polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]], observers moving towards the [[tropics]] from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.\n\nThe lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the \"horns\" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, [[wet moon|the crescent opens upward]]. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.\n\n===Earthshine===\n[[File:Lumiere cendr\u00e9e (12273290216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[exposure (photography)|overexposed]] photograph of a crescent Moon reveals earthshine and stars.]]\n{{main|Earthlight (astronomy)}}\n\nWhen the Moon as seen from Earth is a thin [[crescent]], Earth as viewed from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] and sometimes picturesquely described as \"the old moon in the new moon's arms\" or \"the new moon in the old moon's arms\".\n\n==Calendar==\n{{main|Lunar calendar}}\n[[File:Moon phase calendar May2005.jpg|thumb|left|May\u2013June 2005 calendar of lunar phases]]\n\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] month, which is {{frac|12}} of a [[tropical year]], is about 30.44 days, while the cycle of lunar phases (the Moon's [[Orbital period#Synodic period|synodic period]]) repeats every [[Lunar month#Synodic month|29.53 days]] on average. Therefore, the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (A [[lunar year]] lasts about 354 days.)\n\nPhotographing the Moon's phase every day for a month (starting in the evening after [[sunset]], and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later, and ending in the morning before [[sunrise]]) and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a [[composite image]] like the example calendar (May 8 &ndash; June 6, 2005) shown on the left. May 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19 and the next after midnight on May 21.\n\nSimilarly, on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times, some days will appear to be skipped. When moonrise precedes [[midnight]] one night, the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night (so too with moonset). The \"skipped day\" is just a feature of the Moon's [[prograde motion|eastward movement]] in relation to the Sun, which at most latitudes, causes the Moon to rise later each day. The Moon follows a predictable orbit every month.\n\n==Calculating phase==\n[[File:BethinAZ - 10-13.002 (by).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A crescent Moon over [[Kingman, Arizona]]]]\n\nEach of the four intermediate phases lasts approximately seven days (7.38 days on average), but varies slightly due to lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]].\n\nThe number of days counted from the time of the [[new moon]] is the Moon's \"age\". Each complete cycle of phases is called a \"[[lunation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php |title=Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |language=en |access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe approximate age of the Moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this [[modulo operation|modulo]] 29.530588853 (the length of a [[synodic month]]). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the [[Julian day|Julian day number]] of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly [[circular orbit]] and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon occurred and therefore may be incorrect by several hours. (It also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date). It is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing lunar phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation.\n\n== Effect of [[parallax]] ==\nThe [[Earth]] subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the [[West|western horizon]]. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality, the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the [[East|eastern horizon]] at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a [[month]]. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\n[[File:Orbit of the Moon in 2013.ogv|right|thumb|The ''lunar phase'' depends on the Moon's position in orbit around the Earth and the Earth's position in orbit around the sun. This animation (''not to scale'') looks down on Earth from the north pole of the ecliptic.]]\n\nIt might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a [[solar eclipse]], but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the [[Earth's shadow]] falls on the Moon, causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed ''every'' month because the plane of the [[Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is tilted by about 5\u00b0 with respect to the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun (the plane of the [[ecliptic]]). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an [[eclipse]] can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of [[lunar node|its nodes]]). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Blue moon]]\n* [[Lunar effect]]\n* [[Lunation]]\n* [[Observing the Moon]]\n* [[Planetary phase]]\n* [[Planetshine#Earthshine|Planetshine]]\n* [[Tide]]s\n* [[Week]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buick|first1=Tony |last2=Pugh|first2=Philip |title=How to Photograph the Moon and Planets with Your Digital Camera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4OHwWR9nFMC&pg=PA70|date= 2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5828-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Kelley|first1=David H. |last2=Milone|first2=Eugene F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC|year=2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6|edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kutner|first=Marc L. |title=Astronomy: A Physical Perspective|url=https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn/page/435 435]|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52927-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lynch|first=Mike |title=Texas Starwatch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3jR5NRgUy0C&pg=PA107+|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61060-511-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Naylor|first=John |title=Out of the Blue: A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQOJGerV2IcC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80925-2}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.

The lunar phases gradually change over the period of a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] (about 29.53 days), as the [[orbit]]al positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the [[Sun]] shift.\n\nThe Moon's rotation is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] by Earth's [[gravity]]; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth. This [[near side of the Moon|near side]] is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]]. Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at [[new moon]]) to 100% (at [[full moon]]). The [[terminator (solar)#Lunar terminator|lunar terminator]] is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.\n\nEach of the four \"intermediate\" lunar phases (see below) is around 7.4 [[day]]s, but this [[orbital eccentricity|varies slightly]] due to the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some [[lunar craters|craters]] near the lunar poles, such as [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]], all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of [[daylight]], followed by 14.77 days of \"[[night]]\". (The [[far side of the Moon|side of the Moon]] facing away from Earth is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", although that is a [[misnomer]]).\n\n<br />\n\n==Phases of the Moon==\n{{redirect|Waxing gibbous|the album|Waxing Gibbous}}\n[[File:Moon phases en.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The phases of the Moon as viewed looking southward from the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

These are the instances when the Moon's [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] and the Sun's [[ecliptic]] longitude differ by 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0, respectively.{{efn|Strictly, the quarter phases happen when the observer\u2013Moon\u2013Sun angle is 90\u00b0, also known as [[quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]]. This is not exactly the same as having the Sun\u2013observer\u2013Moon angle a right-angle, but the difference is very slight.}} Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon's apparent shape is either [[crescent]] or [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]]. These shapes, and the periods when the Moon shows them, are called the ''intermediate phases'' and last one-quarter of a [[synodic month]], or 7.38 days, on average. However, their durations [[orbital eccentricity|vary slightly]] because the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is rather [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]], so the satellite's [[orbital speed]] is not constant. The descriptor ''waxing'' is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to full moon, and ''waning'' when the shape is thinning.\n\nThe eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:\n\n<center>\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Principal and intermediate phases of the Moon\n!

The camera is locked to the Moon as Earth rapidly rotates in the foreground.]]\n\nNon-Western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases; for example, traditional [[Hawaiian culture]] has a total of 30 phases (one per day).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hawaiian Moon Names |work=Imiloa, Hilo Attractions |url=http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57/ |access-date=2013-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102085746/http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57 |archive-date=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Waxing and waning===\n[[File:Moon Phase Diagram for Simple English Wikipedia.GIF|thumb|Diagram of the Moon's phases: The Earth is at the center of the diagram and the Moon is shown orbiting.]]\nWhen the Sun and Moon are [[conjunction (astronomy)|aligned on the same side]] of the Earth, the Moon is \"new\", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the Moon ''waxes'' (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]] moon, and full moon. The Moon is then said to ''wane'' as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon. The terms ''old moon'' and ''new moon'' are not interchangeable. The \"old moon\" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Astronomy Lesson 7 - The Phases of the Moon |url=http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/moon2.html |website=Synapses.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref> ''Half moon'' is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term ''quarter'' refers to the extent of the Moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.\n\nWhen an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an [[ellipse]] and circle (in which the ellipse's [[major axis]] coincides with the circle's diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards),<ref>Origin: 1350\u20131400; Middle English < Latin ''gibb\u014dsus''  humped, equivalent to ''gibb'' \"(a) hump\" + ''-\u014dsus'' \"-ous\"; {{cite web |title=Gibbous |work=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gibbous}}</ref> whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a [[crescent]]. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=CNN |first1=Leah Asmelash and David Allan |title=A black moon is coming on July 31. Here's what that means |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/us/black-moon-trnd-scn/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>\n\n===Orientation by latitude===\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if the left (east) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as [[wikt:wax|waxing]] (shifting toward full moon). If the right (west) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)\n\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180\u00b0, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.\n\nCloser to the [[Equator]], the [[lunar terminator]] will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at [[middle latitude|middle]] or [[polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]], observers moving towards the [[tropics]] from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.\n\nThe lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the \"horns\" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, [[wet moon|the crescent opens upward]]. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.\n\n===Earthshine===\n[[File:Lumiere cendr\u00e9e (12273290216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[exposure (photography)|overexposed]] photograph of a crescent Moon reveals earthshine and stars.]]\n{{main|Earthlight (astronomy)}}\n\nWhen the Moon as seen from Earth is a thin [[crescent]], Earth as viewed from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] and sometimes picturesquely described as \"the old moon in the new moon's arms\" or \"the new moon in the old moon's arms\".\n\n==Calendar==\n{{main|Lunar calendar}}\n[[File:Moon phase calendar May2005.jpg|thumb|left|May\u2013June 2005 calendar of lunar phases]]\n\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] month, which is {{frac|12}} of a [[tropical year]], is about 30.44 days, while the cycle of lunar phases (the Moon's [[Orbital period#Synodic period|synodic period]]) repeats every [[Lunar month#Synodic month|29.53 days]] on average. Therefore, the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (A [[lunar year]] lasts about 354 days.)\n\nPhotographing the Moon's phase every day for a month (starting in the evening after [[sunset]], and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later, and ending in the morning before [[sunrise]]) and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a [[composite image]] like the example calendar (May 8 &ndash; June 6, 2005) shown on the left. May 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19 and the next after midnight on May 21.\n\nSimilarly, on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times, some days will appear to be skipped. When moonrise precedes [[midnight]] one night, the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night (so too with moonset). The \"skipped day\" is just a feature of the Moon's [[prograde motion|eastward movement]] in relation to the Sun, which at most latitudes, causes the Moon to rise later each day. The Moon follows a predictable orbit every month.\n\n==Calculating phase==\n[[File:BethinAZ - 10-13.002 (by).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A crescent Moon over [[Kingman, Arizona]]]]\n\nEach of the four intermediate phases lasts approximately seven days (7.38 days on average), but varies slightly due to lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]].\n\nThe number of days counted from the time of the [[new moon]] is the Moon's \"age\". Each complete cycle of phases is called a \"[[lunation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php |title=Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |language=en |access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe approximate age of the Moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this [[modulo operation|modulo]] 29.530588853 (the length of a [[synodic month]]). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the [[Julian day|Julian day number]] of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly [[circular orbit]] and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon occurred and therefore may be incorrect by several hours. (It also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date). It is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing lunar phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation.\n\n== Effect of [[parallax]] ==\nThe [[Earth]] subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the [[West|western horizon]]. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality, the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the [[East|eastern horizon]] at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a [[month]]. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\n[[File:Orbit of the Moon in 2013.ogv|right|thumb|The ''lunar phase'' depends on the Moon's position in orbit around the Earth and the Earth's position in orbit around the sun. This animation (''not to scale'') looks down on Earth from the north pole of the ecliptic.]]\n\nIt might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a [[solar eclipse]], but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the [[Earth's shadow]] falls on the Moon, causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed ''every'' month because the plane of the [[Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is tilted by about 5\u00b0 with respect to the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun (the plane of the [[ecliptic]]). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an [[eclipse]] can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of [[lunar node|its nodes]]). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Blue moon]]\n* [[Lunar effect]]\n* [[Lunation]]\n* [[Observing the Moon]]\n* [[Planetary phase]]\n* [[Planetshine#Earthshine|Planetshine]]\n* [[Tide]]s\n* [[Week]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buick|first1=Tony |last2=Pugh|first2=Philip |title=How to Photograph the Moon and Planets with Your Digital Camera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4OHwWR9nFMC&pg=PA70|date= 2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5828-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Kelley|first1=David H. |last2=Milone|first2=Eugene F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC|year=2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6|edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kutner|first=Marc L. |title=Astronomy: A Physical Perspective|url=https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn/page/435 435]|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52927-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lynch|first=Mike |title=Texas Starwatch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3jR5NRgUy0C&pg=PA107+|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61060-511-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Naylor|first=John |title=Out of the Blue: A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQOJGerV2IcC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80925-2}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.
