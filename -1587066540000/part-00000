The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u1f10\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' / ''elachistos'', meaning \"diminutive\", and ''suchus'', [[Latin]]ized Greek ''souchos'', an Egyptian crocodile god, in reference to the size of the holotype and its identification by Janensch as a [[pseudosuchia]]n archosaur. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''huenei'' honors the German paleontologist [[Friedrich von Huene]] who greatly contributed to the study of various [[vertebrate]] groups, especially extinct reptiles.<ref name=Elachistosuchus/>\n\nJanensch described ''Elachistosuchus'' based on an associated partial [[skeleton]] of a single individual, the [[holotype]] MB.R.&nbsp;4520, which consists of six small blocks (I\u2013VI) of bone-bearing rock currently housed at the fossil reptile collection of the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]], in Germany. Block I preserves a nearly complete but crushed [[skull]], while the right [[humerus]] associated with articulated [[vertebrae]] including the back portion of the neck and the front portion of the back with [[rib]] fragments are preserved in block II, along with shoulder girdle elements including the interclavicle, [[clavicle]]s, [[coracoid]]s and one scapula, first observed using \u03bcCT scanning. Blocks III to VI consist of fragments of ribs, isolated [[dorsal vertebrae|back vertebrae]], and gastralia. MB.R.&nbsp;4520 and additional unprepared material attributed to ''Elachistosuchus'' were found during the excavation of a skeleton of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' around 1928. They were collected from a locality which lies along the present-day highway (Bundesstrasse) B79 between [[Halberstadt]] and [[Quedlinburg]], on the southeastern edge of [[Halberstadt]], in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], from a brick-[[clay]] pit unit of the [[Arnstadt Formation]], dating to the middle to late [[Norian]] stage of the middle [[Late Triassic]]. The site was initially excavated by [[Otto Jaekel]] between 1909 and 1912 and later Janensch conducted additional excavations there between 1923 and 1928, but except for smaller digs by A. Hemprich in 1937 and 1938 no further work has taken place since. The diverse Late Triassic biota from Halberstadt includes [[bivalve]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[chondrichthyan]]s, [[dipnoan]]s, [[temnospondyl]]s, stem-[[turtle]]s, [[phytosaur]]s, and a [[haramiyid]] mammal, as well as the [[sauropodomorph]] ''Plateosaurus'', which is represented by some 50 specimens including at least two complete skeletons.<ref name=ElachistosuchusRev/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Elachistosuchus skull.PNG|thumb|upright|Segmented skull, vertebrae and shoulder girdle bones]] \n''Elachistosuchus'' was originally thought to be a [[pseudosuchia]]n archosaur by Janensch (1949). Janensch diagnosed it among other pseudosuchians by its small body size, the lack of a specialized body plan, and the presence of a large post[[temporal fenestra]] and what he believed to be an ant[[orbital fenestra]].<ref name=Elachistosuchus/> Walker (1966) reinterpreted ''Elachistosuchus'' as a [[rhynchocephalia]]n closely related to the only living genus ''[[Sphenodon]]'' (the [[tuatara]]), based on the long front portion of the [[jugal bone]], the allegedly [[acrodont]] dentition, the large posttemporal fenestra, the absence of an external [[lower jaw]] [[fenestra (anatomy)|fenestra]], and a strongly twisted end of the [[humerus]].

It contains a [[type species|single species]], '''''Elachistosuchus huenei''''', known from a single individual. ''E. huenei'', originally considered a [[pseudosuchia]]n [[archosaur]] and then a [[rhynchocephalia]]n [[lepidosaur]], was largely ignored in the scientific literature, as its small size and fragility didn't permit further mechanical preparation and examination. More recently however a non-invasive \u03bcCT scanning was performed to resolve its placement within [[Reptilia]], and found it to represent a more basal reptile, potentially closely related to several early archosauromorph [[clade]]s.<ref name=ElachistosuchusRev>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0135114 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135114 | title = Anatomy of the Enigmatic Reptile ''Elachistosuchus huenei'' Janensch, 1949 (Reptilia: Diapsida) from the Upper Triassic of Germany and Its Relevance for the Origin of Sauria | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = e0135114 | year = 2015 | last1 = Sobral | first1 = Gabriela | last2 = Sues | first2 = Hans-Dieter | last3 = M\u00fcller | first3 = Johannes | pmid=26352985 | pmc=4564268}}</ref><ref name=Elachistosuchus>{{cite journal | last1 = Janensch | first1 = W | year = 1949 | title = Ein neues Reptil aus dem Keuper von Halberstadt | url = | journal = N Jb Mineral Geol Palaeont B. | volume = 1949 | issue = | pages = 225\u2013242 }}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nFossils of ''Elachistosuchus'' were first described and named by the German [[paleontologist]] [[Werner Janensch]] in [[1949 in paleontology|1949]], with the [[type species]] being ''Elachistosuchus huenei''. The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u1f10\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' / ''elachistos'', meaning \"diminutive\", and ''suchus'', [[Latin]]ized Greek ''souchos'', an Egyptian crocodile god, in reference to the size of the holotype and its identification by Janensch as a [[pseudosuchia]]n archosaur. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''huenei'' honors the German paleontologist [[Friedrich von Huene]] who greatly contributed to the study of various [[vertebrate]] groups, especially extinct reptiles.<ref name=Elachistosuchus/>\n\nJanensch described ''Elachistosuchus'' based on an associated partial [[skeleton]] of a single individual, the [[holotype]] MB.R.&nbsp;4520, which consists of six small blocks (I\u2013VI) of bone-bearing rock currently housed at the fossil reptile collection of the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]], in Germany. Block I preserves a nearly complete but crushed [[skull]], while the right [[humerus]] associated with articulated [[vertebrae]] including the back portion of the neck and the front portion of the back with [[rib]] fragments are preserved in block II, along with shoulder girdle elements including the interclavicle, [[clavicle]]s, [[coracoid]]s and one scapula, first observed using \u03bcCT scanning. Blocks III to VI consist of fragments of ribs, isolated [[dorsal vertebrae|back vertebrae]], and gastralia. MB.R.&nbsp;4520 and additional unprepared material attributed to ''Elachistosuchus'' were found during the excavation of a skeleton of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' around 1928. They were collected from a locality which lies along the present-day highway (Bundesstrasse) B79 between [[Halberstadt]] and [[Quedlinburg]], on the southeastern edge of [[Halberstadt]], in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], from a brick-[[clay]] pit unit of the [[Arnstadt Formation]], dating to the middle to late [[Norian]] stage of the middle [[Late Triassic]]. The site was initially excavated by [[Otto Jaekel]] between 1909 and 1912 and later Janensch conducted additional excavations there between 1923 and 1928, but except for smaller digs by A. Hemprich in 1937 and 1938 no further work has taken place since. The diverse Late Triassic biota from Halberstadt includes [[bivalve]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[chondrichthyan]]s, [[dipnoan]]s, [[temnospondyl]]s, stem-[[turtle]]s, [[phytosaur]]s, and a [[haramiyid]] mammal, as well as the [[sauropodomorph]] ''Plateosaurus'', which is represented by some 50 specimens including at least two complete skeletons.<ref name=ElachistosuchusRev/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Elachistosuchus skull.PNG|thumb|upright|Segmented skull, vertebrae and shoulder girdle bones]] \n''Elachistosuchus'' was originally thought to be a [[pseudosuchia]]n archosaur by Janensch (1949). Janensch diagnosed it among other pseudosuchians by its small body size, the lack of a specialized body plan, and the presence of a large post[[temporal fenestra]] and what he believed to be an ant[[orbital fenestra]].<ref name=Elachistosuchus/> Walker (1966) reinterpreted ''Elachistosuchus'' as a [[rhynchocephalia]]n closely related to the only living genus ''[[Sphenodon]]'' (the [[tuatara]]), based on the long front portion of the [[jugal bone]], the allegedly [[acrodont]] dentition, the large posttemporal fenestra, the absence of an external [[lower jaw]] [[fenestra (anatomy)|fenestra]], and a strongly twisted end of the [[humerus]]. Walker (1966) also argued that the antorbital fenestra identified by Janensch actually represented a damaged opening for the [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal canal]].<ref name=ElachistosuchusRev/>\n\nDue to the small size and fragility of the holotype, further mechanical preparation is not possible, which caused ''Elachistosuchus'' to be largely ignored in the scientific literature.

''Elachistosuchus'' was considered by them to represent a small diapsid reptile, probably a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[archosauromorph]] (based on the results of several [[phylogenetic analyses]]), with a distinct back-side portion of the [[frontal bone]], [[maxilla]]ry tooth row that extends behind the back margin of [[eye socket]], a [[jugal bone]] with free back process, a palatine ramus of the [[pterygoid bone]] with [[shagreen]] of teeth, an [[angular bone]] exposed along about one third of the side surface of [[mandibula]]r ramus, dichocephalous chest ribs, a notched front margin of the [[interclavicle]], and a spoon-shaped back projection of the interclavicle.<ref name=ElachistosuchusRev/>\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe [[phylogenetic]] position of ''Elachistosuchus'' was explored by Sobral, Sues and M\u00fcller (2015) two recently constructed data matrix.
