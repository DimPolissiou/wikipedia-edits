It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership.

The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership.

The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth.
