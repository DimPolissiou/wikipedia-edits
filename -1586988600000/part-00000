{"title_page": "Ordination of women in Protestant denominations", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Christianity and gender|theology}}\n\n[[Ordination]] is the process by which individuals are [[Consecration|consecrated]], that is, set apart as clergy to perform various religious [[Rite#Christianity|rites and ceremonies]] such as celebrating the [[sacrament]]s. The process and ceremonies of ordination varies by [[Religious denomination|denomination]]. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The [[liturgy]] used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordinal.\n\n'''Ordination of women''' has been taking place in an increasing number of '''Protestant churches''' during the 20th century.\n\nWhile ordination of women has been approved in many denominations over the past half century, it is still a very controversial and divisive topic.\n\n==Overview of the theological debate==\nMost (although not all) Protestant denominations ordain church leaders who have the task of equipping all believers in their Christian service ({{bibleref2|Ephesians|4:11\u201313}}). These leaders (variously styled ''elders'', ''pastors'', or ''ministers'') are seen to have a distinct role in teaching, pastoral leadership.\n\nProtestant churches have historically viewed the Bible as the ultimate authority in church debates (the doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''), as such the debate over women's eligibility for such offices normally centers around interpretation of certain Biblical passages relating to teaching and leadership roles.  The main passages in this debate include {{Bibleref2|1Cor|11:2\u201316|ESV|1 Cor. 11:2\u201316}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor|14:34\u201335|ESV|1 Cor. 14:34\u201335}} and {{Bibleref2|1Tim|2:11\u201314|ESV|1 Tim. 2:11\u201314}}, {{Bibleref2|1Tim|3:1\u20137|ESV|1 Tim. 3:1\u20137}}, {{Bibleref2|Tit|1:5\u20139|ESV|Tit. 1:5\u20139}}\n\nIncreasingly however, supporters of women in ministry argue that the Biblical passages used to argue against women's ordination might be read differently when more understanding of the unique historical context of each passage is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Women_Service_Church.htm|title=Women's Service in the Church: The Biblical Basis by N.T. Wright|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}</ref> They further argue that the New Testament shows that women did exercise certain ministries in the apostolic Church (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Acts|21:9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|18:18}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:1\u20134}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:7}}; {{Bibleref2|1Cor|16:19|ESV|1 Cor. 16:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Philippians|4:2\u20133}}, and {{Bibleref2|John|20:1\u201318|NRSV}}. Often quoting {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}},they argue that the good news brought by Jesus has broken down all barriers and that female ordination is an equality issue that Jesus would have approved of. They also quote {{Bibleref2|John|20:17\u201318|NRSV}}, and argue that in talking to Mary, Jesus is calling for women to evangelize\n\nIn turn, those who argue for a male only ministry will say that the claims to contexts that change the apparent meaning of the texts at hand to one supporting female ordination are in fact spurious, that the passages that appear to show women in positions of authority do not in fact do so and the idea that the good news of Jesus brings equality before God only relates to salvation and not to roles for ministry.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== By tradition ==\n=== Anabaptist ===\n'''Brethren'''\n\n* The [[Church of the Brethren]] has ordained women since 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brethren.org/about/statements/2008-womens-ordination.pdf|title=Resolution on 50 Years of Women's Ordination in the Church of the Brethren|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2008|website=www.brethren.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Mennonite ====\n* The [[Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches]]' has ordained women.<ref>http://www.mbconf.ca/home/products_and_services/resources/publications/mb_herald/vol_47_no_5/people_and_events/ordination_of_two_women_revives_discussion/</ref>\n* The [[Mennonite Church Canada]] ordains women.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* The [[Mennonite Brethren Church]] does not ordain women to be lead pastors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* The [[Mennonite Church USA]] ordains women.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Anglican ===\n{{Main|Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion}}\nThe ordination of women in the [[Anglican Communion]] has been increasingly common in certain provinces since the 1970s.

The process and ceremonies of ordination varies by [[Religious denomination|denomination]]. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The [[liturgy]] used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordinal.\n\n'''Ordination of women''' has been taking place in an increasing number of '''Protestant churches''' during the 20th century.\n\nWhile ordination of women has been approved in many denominations over the past half century, it is still a very controversial and divisive topic.\n\n==Overview of the theological debate==\nMost (although not all) Protestant denominations ordain church leaders who have the task of equipping all believers in their Christian service ({{bibleref2|Ephesians|4:11\u201313}}). These leaders (variously styled ''elders'', ''pastors'', or ''ministers'') are seen to have a distinct role in teaching, pastoral leadership.\n\nProtestant churches have historically viewed the Bible as the ultimate authority in church debates (the doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''), as such the debate over women's eligibility for such offices normally centers around interpretation of certain Biblical passages relating to teaching and leadership roles.  The main passages in this debate include {{Bibleref2|1Cor|11:2\u201316|ESV|1 Cor. 11:2\u201316}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor|14:34\u201335|ESV|1 Cor. 14:34\u201335}} and {{Bibleref2|1Tim|2:11\u201314|ESV|1 Tim. 2:11\u201314}}, {{Bibleref2|1Tim|3:1\u20137|ESV|1 Tim. 3:1\u20137}}, {{Bibleref2|Tit|1:5\u20139|ESV|Tit. 1:5\u20139}}\n\nIncreasingly however, supporters of women in ministry argue that the Biblical passages used to argue against women's ordination might be read differently when more understanding of the unique historical context of each passage is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Women_Service_Church.htm|title=Women's Service in the Churh: The Biblical Baisi by N.T. Wright|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}</ref> They further argue that the New Testament shows that women did exercise certain ministries in the apostolic Church (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Acts|21:9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|18:18}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:1\u20134}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|16:7}}; {{Bibleref2|1Cor|16:19|ESV|1 Cor. 16:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Philippians|4:2\u20133}}, and {{Bibleref2|John|20:1\u201318|NRSV}}. Often quoting {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}},they argue that the good news brought by Jesus has broken down all barriers and that female ordination is an equality issue that Jesus would have approved of. They also quote {{Bibleref2|John|20:17\u201318|NRSV}}, and argue that in talking to Mary, Jesus is calling for women to evangelize\n\nIn turn, those who argue for a male only ministry will say that the claims to contexts that change the apparent meaning of the texts at hand to one supporting female ordination are in fact spurious, that the passages that appear to show women in positions of authority do not in fact do so and the idea that the good news of Jesus brings equality before God only relates to salvation and not to roles for ministry.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== By tradition ==\n=== Anabaptist ===\n'''Brethren'''\n\n* The [[Church of the Brethren]] has ordained women since 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brethren.org/about/statements/2008-womens-ordination.pdf|title=Resolution on 50 Years of Women's Ordination in the Church of the Brethren|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2008|website=www.brethren.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Mennonite ====\n* The [[Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches]]' has ordained women.<ref>http://www.mbconf.ca/home/products_and_services/resources/publications/mb_herald/vol_47_no_5/people_and_events/ordination_of_two_women_revives_discussion/</ref>\n* The [[Mennonite Church Canada]] ordains women.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* The [[Mennonite Brethren Church]] does not ordain women to be lead pastors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n* The [[Mennonite Church USA]] ordains women.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Anglican ===\n{{Main|Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion}}\nThe ordination of women in the [[Anglican Communion]] has been increasingly common in certain provinces since the 1970s.

The route begins in [[Sprague, Connecticut|Sprague]] at [[Route 97 (Connecticut)|Route 97]]. From its western terminus up to the junction with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|Interstate 395]] in Griswold, the road functions as a [[collector road]].

It has a three-way overlap with [[Connecticut Route 165|Route 165]] and [[Connecticut Route 49|Route 49]], along Beach Pond Road. Route 138 continues east as Rockville Road into the state of [[Rhode Island]], becoming [[Rhode Island Route 138]].<ref name=\"disc1\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1920s, a loop route of [[New England Route 12]] from south of [[Taftville, Connecticut|Taftville]] to [[Jewett City, Connecticut|Jewett City]] via the village of [[Newent, Connecticut|Newent]] was a secondary state highway known as '''Highway 356'''. At the same time, the road connecting Jewett City and the town center of [[Voluntown, Connecticut|Voluntown]] was known as '''Highway 321'''. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], Route 138 was established from the piece of old Highway 356 from Newent to Jewett City and from the entire length of old Highway 321. Route 138 was extended to the [[Rhode Island]] state line in 1938 along former SR 420, where it connected with the westward extension of [[Rhode Island Route 138]], which had originally ended in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. This resulted in a three-state [[Massachusetts Route 138|Route 138 all the way]] to the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. Route 138 in Connecticut was extended west to its current western terminus located at [[Route 97 (Connecticut)|Route 97]] in 1962 as part of the Route Reclassification Act.<ref name=\"disc2\">{{cite web|author=Kurumi|title=Route 138|year=2006|publisher=Kurumi|accessdate=2008-01-19|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct138.html}}</ref>\n\n==Junction list==\n{{CTinttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"disc1\"/>|county=New London}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Sprague\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|Route|97|city1=Scotland|city2=Norwich}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Lisbon\n|lspan=2\n|mile=4.05\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|Route|169|city1=Canterbury|city2=Taftville}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=5.78\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|Route|12|dir1=south|city1=Lisbon}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of CT 12 overlap}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Griswold\n|lspan=4\n|type=concur\n|mile=6.17\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|Route|12|dir1=north|city1=Plainfield}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of CT 12 overlap}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=6.91\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|Route|164|dir1=South|city1=Preston}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=\n|mile=7.24\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|I|395|CTTP|city1=Norwich|location2=[[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester, MA]]}}\n|notes=I-395/Conn.
