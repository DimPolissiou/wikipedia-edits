It was likely a reemergence of the mid-6th-century [[Plague of Justinian]]. Called after [[Emmaus-Nicopolis|Amwas]] in [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], the principal camp of the Muslim Arab army, the plague killed up to 25,000 soldiers and their relatives, including most of the army's high command, and caused considerable loss of life and displacement among the indigenous Christians of Syria. The appointment of [[Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan]] to the governorship of Syria in the wake of the commanders' deaths paved the way for his establishment of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in 661, while recurrences of the disease may have contributed to the [[Umayyad dynasty]]'s downfall in 750.

Abu Ubayda, aware of Umar's intent, refused to abandon his men.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} Umar subsequently embarked for Syria to assess the situation, meeting with the army leaders at a desert way-stop called Sargh (thirteen days' march north of Medina).{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92, note 324}} His first consultations were with leaders from the [[Muhajirun]] and [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] factions, collectively the earliest Muslim converts and elite of the nascent Muslim state, who argued against fleeing the plague-affected areas.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92}} Disagreeing with their recommendations, he next consulted the leaders of the later converts from the [[Quraysh]], the tribe to which the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and the caliphs belonged, who proposed that the army should withdraw from the area of the epidemic, which Umar accepted.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92}} Abu Ubayda protested the army's withdrawal on the basis of a purported prohibition by Muhammad on Muslims fleeing or entering a plague-affected land.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} Umar retorted that a person would naturally choose the green side of a valley rather than the barren side, but regardless of the person's decision it would be God's will.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} This narrative was used by medieval Muslim scholars as a precedent justifying flight from an epidemic.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} The summit at Sargh concluded with Umar ordering Abu Ubdaya to lead the army to healthier grounds and the caliph's return to Medina.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}\n\nAbu Ubayda moved to encamp the army at the old [[Ghassanid]] capital of [[Jabiya]] in the highland region of the [[Hauran]].{{sfn|Shahid|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} Due to its healthy climate, Jabiya effectively acted as a [[sanatorium]] for plague-stricken troops and the center for the distribution of war spoils.{{sfn|Shahid|2002|p=101}} On the way there, in 639, Abu Ubayda succumbed to the plague.{{sfn|Conrad|1981|pp=209\u2013210}} His successor [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]] and two of Mu'adh's wives and son (or his entire family) died immediately after,<ref name=\"Stearns29\">{{EI3|last=Stearns|first=Justin K. |title=\u02bfAmw\u0101s, plague of|year=2009|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/amwas-plague-of-COM_24915|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=55}} followed by Mu'adh's successor Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} Shurahbil also died from the plague.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378, note 68}} Among the other prominent Muslims and [[companions of Muhammad]] in the army to succumb were [[Suhayl ibn Amr]], Suhayl's son [[Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl|Abu Jandal]], [[al-Fadl ibn Abbas]], [[al-Harith ibn Hisham]],{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378, note 68}} and many of al-Harith's seventy family members who had settled in Syria.{{sfn|Hinds|1991|p=139}} Amr is credited for leading the surviving Muslim troops to Jabiya.{{sfn|Conrad|1981|pp=170, 210}} In December 639, he embarked on the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquest of Egypt]], either with Umar's reluctant sanction or without the caliph's authorization.{{sfn|Wensinck|1960|p=451}}{{sfn|Christides|1993|p=153}}\n\nThe Islamic traditional accounts maintain between 20,000 and 25,000 Muslim soldiers in Syria and their family members died in the plague.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}}{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} By 639, 4,000 Muslim troops were left in Jabiya out of some 24,000 in 637, though the modern historian [[Fred Donner]] notes that it is unclear how many of the missing troops had died or had temporarily fled and returned to Syria eventually.{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=245}}\n\nThe plague caused substantial loss of life among the local Christian population in Syria.{{sfn|Bray|1996|p=40}} It also resulted in price rises and hoarding, prompting Umar to prohibit hoarding.{{sfn|Biesterfeldt|G\u00fcnther|2018|p=780}} According to [[al-Tabari]] (d. 923), after returning to Medina from Sargh, Umar informed his advisers of his intention to visit his troops in Syria\u2013Palestine and assess the chaos wrought by the plague. During his purported visit in 639, he gave directions on the disposition of the estates of the Muslims who died in the epidemic and settled suspicious claims by some of the troops.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}}\n\n===Long-term political and societal effects===\nAs a result of the deaths of his top commanders in Syria, Umar appointed Yazid's brother and deputy, [[Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan]], commander of the army there, ultimately laying the foundation for the establishment of the Syria-centered [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by Mu'awiya in 661.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} The historian [[Wilferd Madelung]] surmises that the plague in Syria had precluded Umar from deploying commanders more preferable to him from Medina and he thus appointed Mu'awiya in lieu of a suitable alternative.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=61}} The losses among the Muslim troops in Syria caused by the Amwas plague contributed to Mu'awiya's heavy military reliance on older-established, formerly Byzantine-allied and Christian Arab tribes in Syria, particularly the [[Banu Kalb]], who had largely stayed neutral during the fighting between the Muslims and the Byzantines in Syria during the 630s.{{sfn|Jandora|1986|p=111}}\n\nThe heavy toll on the indigenous Christian population and increased emigration from Syria as a result of the plague of Amwas may have been a contributing factor in the increased settlement of Syria by the Arabs and their penetration of local society during Umayyad rule (640s\u2013750).{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}} According to the historian [[Lawrence Conrad]], the Arabs, relying on revenue from the [[jizyah|poll tax]] collected from the non-Arabs in the [[early Muslim conquests|conquered regions]], may not have intended to settle Syria, but were forced to repopulate the deserted countryside in the aftermath of the plague.{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}} The policy of settling Arab tribesmen on the land proved exceptional; in other conquered areas, such as Iraq, early Arab settlement was mostly confined to newly-built [[amsar|garrison cities]].{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAmwas was replaced as the Arabs' headquarters in [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]] first by [[Lydda]] and/or [[Jerusalem]], followed by [[Ramla]], which was founded by the Umayyad caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] in the early 8th century.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}}{{sfn|Luz|1997|pp=30-31}} As late as the 1870s a well in the [[Imwas|village of Amwas]] bore the name ''bir al-ta'un'' (well of the plague).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clermont-Ganneau |first1=M. |title=Quarterly Statement |date=1874 |publisher=R.

The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliphs routinely withdrew from Syria's cities to their Syrian [[desert castles|desert palaces]] during recurrences of the plague epidemic.]]\n\nThere were recurrences of the plague in Syria\u2013Palestine about every decade between 688/89 and 744/45.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} \"The [[Umayyad dynasty|Umaiyad ''[sic]'' dynasty]] was literally plagued by this disease\", in the words of Dols.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380}} The deaths of the Umayyad caliphs [[Mu'awiya II]] ({{reign|683|684}}), [[Marwan I]] ({{reign|684|685}}), [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}), Sulayman ({{reign|715|717}}) and the Umayyad governors in Iraq [[al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba]] ({{reign|661|671}}) and [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] ({{reign|685|673}}) may all possibly have been caused by the plague epidemics in Syria and Iraq.{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=378\u2013380}}{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=55}} The caliphs routinely withdrew from the cities to their [[desert castles|desert palaces]] when the plague emerged during the summer months.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380}} Notable among them was Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] ({{reign|724|743}}), who preferred his palace at [[Resafa|Rusafa]] over Damascus because he viewed the latter to be unhealthy.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380, note 97}}\n\nDols speculates that the frequent recurrences may have consistently undercut natural population growth in Syria\u2013Palestine, the center of the Umayyad Caliphate, and weakened Umayyad power.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} Concurrently, Arab tribal migrations into the far eastern province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], which was apparently spared from the plague epidemics, may have led to the lopsided growth and predominance of the eastern half of the Caliphate and the rise of the [[Abbasid Revolution|Abbasid Movement]] there, which ultimately toppled the Umayyads in 750.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} In the view of Conrad, by the end of these plague cycles, the Umayyads has lost practical control of the eastern Caliphate and \"it is tempting to view the interminable plagues of the last years of the dynasty as an important factor in the victory of the Abbasid revolution\".{{sfn|Bray|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Theological interpretations===\nModern historians concur that the actual circumstances of the plague of Amwas are not reconstructable and largely focus on the descriptions of the event in the 8th\u201310th-century Islamic histories and collections of [[hadith]] (traditions and sayings of Muhammad) in the context of theological debates on [[predestination]], the status of Muslim sinners, and contagion.<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/> The plague of Amwas received more attention in medieval Arabic literature than any other epidemic until the 14th-century [[Black Death]].{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=167}} Representations of the plague by the sources were \"varied and contradictory\", according to the historian Justin K. Stearns.<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/> The narratives of the response to the plague by Muhammad's companions Umar, Abu Ubayda, Amr and Mu'adh informed Muslim religious and legal interpretations of plague throughout the Middle Ages, including the response to the Black Death.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/>\n\nMedieval Muslim scholars derived three principals from the contemporary reactions to the plague of Amwas: the first was that the plague was a form of divine mercy or martyrdom for the Muslim faithful and a punishment to non-believers; the second was the prohibition on Muslims entering or fleeing plague-stricken lands; and the third was the plague was not a contagion, rather it was directly imposed by God.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} The tenets consistently caused theological disagreements throughout the epidemic recurrences of the Middle Ages as a result of the difficulty in accepting plague as divine mercy or punishment and observable contagion.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}\n\nIn the assessment of Dols, native Christian and Jewish attitudes and natural human anxieties likely influenced aspects of the first principle, namely that plague represented divine punishment or warnings. Muslims in this camp related the plague to lax morals among the Muslim troops in Syria, such as the consumption of wine, which supposedly led Umar to order the lashing of drinkers. On the other hand, the interpretation of plague as mercy or martyrdom is evident in Abu Ubayda's speeches to the troops at Amwas and in the council at Sargh.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} A poem about the plague of Amwas recorded by the [[Damascus|Damascene]] historian [[Ibn Asakir]] (d. 1175) reflects the martyrdom belief: <blockquote>How many brave horsemen and how many beautiful, chaste women were killed in the valley of 'Amwas <br /> They had encountered the Lord, but He was not unjust to them <br /> When they died, they were among the non-aggrieved people in Paradise. <br /> We endure the plague as the Lord knows, and we were consoled in the hour of death.{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=377\u2013378}}</blockquote>\n\nOn the principle of predestination, the events of Amwas were used to argue that whether a person fled or remained in a plague-affected area their death had already been decreed by God.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} During an episode of plague in the Iraqi garrison city of [[Kufa]], the prominent statesman and scholar [[Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]] (d. 662) turned away visitors to his home due to someone in his household having the plague, and he justified Muslims fleeing plague on the basis of Umar's actions at Sargh.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} According to Dols, this also implied a recognition of contagion despite the contradiction with the purported hadith rejecting contagion as a pre-Islamic theory.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Athamina |first1=Khalil |title=The Appointment and Dismissal of Kh\u0101lid b. al-Wal\u012bd from the Supreme Command: A Study of the Political Strategy of the Early Muslim Caliphs in Syria |journal=Arabica |date=July 1994 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=253\u2013272 |ref=harv |publisher=Brill |jstor=4057449 |doi=10.1163/157005894X00191}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Biesterfeldt |first1=Hinrich |last2=G\u00fcnther |first2=Sebastian |title=The Works of Ibn W\u0101\u1e0di\u1e25 al-Ya\u02bfq\u016bb\u012b (Volume 3): An English Translation |date=2018 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-35621-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHxTDwAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bray |first1=R.

It was likely a reemergence of the mid-6th-century [[Plague of Justinian]]. Called after [[Emmaus-Nicopolis|Amwas]] in [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], the principal camp of the Muslim Arab army, the plague killed up to 25,000 soldiers and their relatives, including most of the army's high command, and caused considerable loss of life and displacement among the indigenous Christians of Syria.

The plague of Amwas first struck the Muslim Arab troops encamped there before spreading across Syria\u2013Palestine and affecting Egypt and Iraq]]\n\nThe plague of Amwas (''ta'un Amwas'' in Arabic) was likely a [[bubonic plague]] epidemic,{{sfn|Conrad|1998|pp=495\u2013496}} though the sources do not elaborate on specific symptoms of the disease.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=382}} It was the second recorded plague of the Islamic era, which began in the 620s, and the first to directly afflict the Muslims.{{sfn|Conrad|1998|p=496}} It was likely a reemergence of the [[Plague of Justinian]],{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=373\u2013374, 376}} which originated in [[Pelusium]] (near modern [[Suez]]) in 541 CE and spread west to [[Alexandria]] and east to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] before reaching the Byzantine capital [[Constantinople]] in 541\u2013542 and afflicting the rest of Europe and the [[Sasanian Empire]], as noted by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Procopius]] (d. {{circa|570}}).{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=371\u2013373}} The Plague of Justinian recurred in at least nine to twelve cycles throughout the mid-6th century and the 7th century.{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\nThe first [[caliph]] (head of the Muslim community) [[Abu Bakr]] ({{reign|632|634}}) dispatched four armies from [[Medina]] led respectively by [[Amr ibn al-As]], [[Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan]], [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]] and [[Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah]] to conquer [[Byzantine Syria]]{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=114}} (Abu Ubayda may not have been dispatched until after the accession of Abu Bakr's successor Caliph [[Umar]] in mid-634).{{sfn|Athamina|1994|pp=257\u2013258}} Amwas, the Arabic name for [[Emmaus-Nicopolis]], had been a fortified Roman army camp in the 1st century CE, which grew into a small city by the early 3rd century.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}} It was captured by the Muslims from the Byzantines following the [[Battle of Ajnadayn]] in 634 or the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}} At the onset of the plague, the site served as the principal camp of the Arab Muslim troops in Syria where spoils were divided and soldiers paid.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}}{{sfn|Luz|1997|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Chronology==\nThe plague of Amwas occurred in the [[Islamic calendar]] years of 17 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]]/638 CE and/or 18 AH/639 CE.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} According to the 8th-century historian [[Sayf ibn Umar]], it struck in [[Muharram]]\u2013[[Safar]] 17 AH/January\u2013February 638, then dissipated before returning once more and inflicting numerous deaths \"to the advantage of the enemy [the Byzantines].\"{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} [[Al-Suyuti]] (d. 1505) holds the plague had reemerged not long after its initial outbreak, which Dols suggests \"accounts for the two dates [638 and 639]\".{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}}\n\nThe plague struck at some point during a nine-month drought in Syria referred to by the Arabs as the 'Year of the Ashes'.{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=152}} Widespread famine in Syria\u2013Palestine possibly set the stage for the plague due to weakened immune resistance and the stockpiling of food reserves in towns and villages, which could attract plague-infected rodents and bring them into contact with the human population, according to Dols.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} It spread across Syria and also affected Iraq and Egypt,{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} before subsiding in [[Shawwal]] 18 AH/ October 639.{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=215}}\n\n==Consequences==\n===Response and immediate impact===\n[[File:Syria toward end of Muslim conquest, c. 638.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] toward the end of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslim conquest]] of the region from the [[Byzantine Empire]], {{circa|638}}]]\nAccording to one of the main narratives of the Islamic traditional sources, Umar, intending to prevent the illness and death of his top commander Abu Ubayda, summoned the latter to Medina; Abu Ubayda, aware of Umar's intent, refused to abandon his men.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} Umar subsequently embarked for Syria to assess the situation, meeting with the army leaders at a desert way-stop called Sargh (thirteen days' march north of Medina).{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92, note 324}} His first consultations were with leaders from the [[Muhajirun]] and [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] factions, collectively the earliest Muslim converts and elite of the nascent Muslim state, who argued against fleeing the plague-affected areas.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92}} Disagreeing with their recommendations, he next consulted the leaders of the later converts from the [[Quraysh]], the tribe to which the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and the caliphs belonged, who proposed that the army should withdraw from the area of the epidemic, which Umar accepted.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}{{sfn|Juynboll|1989|p=92}} Abu Ubayda protested the army's withdrawal on the basis of a purported prohibition by Muhammad on Muslims fleeing or entering a plague-affected land.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} Umar retorted that a person would naturally choose the green side of a valley rather than the barren side, but regardless of the person's decision it would be God's will.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} This narrative was used by medieval Muslim scholars as a precedent justifying flight from an epidemic.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} The summit at Sargh concluded with Umar ordering Abu Ubdaya to lead the army to healthier grounds and the caliph's return to Medina.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}\n\nAbu Ubayda moved to encamp the army at the old [[Ghassanid]] capital of [[Jabiya]] in the highland region of the [[Hauran]].{{sfn|Shahid|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} Due to its healthy climate, Jabiya effectively acted as a [[sanatorium]] for plague-stricken troops and the center for the distribution of war spoils.{{sfn|Shahid|2002|p=101}} On the way there, in 639, Abu Ubayda succumbed to the plague.{{sfn|Conrad|1981|pp=209\u2013210}} His successor [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]] and two of Mu'adh's wives and son (or his entire family) died immediately after,<ref name=\"Stearns29>{{EI3|last=Stearns|first=Justin K. |title=\u02bfAmw\u0101s, plague of|year=2009|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/amwas-plague-of-COM_24915|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=55}} followed by Mu'adh's successor Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} Shurahbil also died from the plague.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378, note 68}} Among the other prominent Muslims and [[companions of Muhammad]] in the army to succumb were [[Suhayl ibn Amr]], Suhayl's son [[Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl|Abu Jandal]], [[al-Fadl ibn Abbas]], [[al-Harith ibn Hisham]],{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378, note 68}} and many of al-Harith's seventy family members who had settled in Syria.{{sfn|Hinds|1991|p=139}} Amr is credited for leading the surviving Muslim troops to Jabiya.{{sfn|Conrad|1981|pp=170, 210}} In December 639, he embarked on the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquest of Egypt]], either with Umar's reluctant sanction or without the caliph's authorization.{{sfn|Wensinck|1960|p=451}}{{sfn|Christides|1993|p=153}}\n\nThe Islamic traditional accounts maintain between 20,000 and 25,000 Muslim soldiers in Syria and their family members died in the plague.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}}{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=376}} By 639, 4,000 Muslim troops were left in Jabiya out of some 24,000 in 637, though the modern historian [[Fred Donner]] notes that it is unclear how many of the missing troops had died or had temporarily fled and returned to Syria eventually.{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=245}}\n\nThe plague caused substantial loss of life among the local Christian population in Syria.{{sfn|Bray|1996|p=40}} It also resulted in price rises and hoarding, prompting Umar to prohibit hoarding.{{sfn|Biesterfeldt|G\u00fcnther|2018|p=780}} According to [[al-Tabari]] (d. 923), after returning to Medina from Sargh, Umar informed his advisers of his intention to visit his troops in Syria\u2013Palestine and assess the chaos wrought by the plague. During his purported visit in 639, he gave directions on the disposition of the estates of the Muslims who died in the epidemic and settled suspicious claims by some of the troops.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}}\n\n===Long-term political and societal effects===\nAs a result of the deaths of his top commanders in Syria, Umar appointed Yazid's brother and deputy, [[Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan]], commander of the army there, ultimately laying the foundation for the establishment of the Syria-centered [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by Mu'awiya in 661.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} The historian [[Wilferd Madelung]] surmises that the plague in Syria had precluded Umar from deploying commanders more preferable to him from Medina and he thus appointed Mu'awiya in lieu of a suitable alternative.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=61}} The losses among the Muslim troops in Syria caused by the Amwas plague contributed to Mu'awiya's heavy military reliance on older-established, formerly Byzantine-allied and Christian Arab tribes in Syria, particularly the [[Banu Kalb]], who had largely stayed neutral during the fighting between the Muslims and the Byzantines in Syria during the 630s.{{sfn|Jandora|1986|p=111}} \n\nThe heavy toll on the indigenous Christian population and increased emigration from Syria as a result of the plague of Amwas may have been a contributing factor in the increased settlement of Syria by the Arabs and their penetration of local society during Umayyad rule (640s\u2013750).{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}} According to the historian [[Lawrence Conrad]], the Arabs, relying on revenue from the [[jizyah|poll tax]] collected from the non-Arabs in the [[early Muslim conquests|conquered regions]], may not have intended to settle Syria, but were forced to repopulate the deserted countryside in the aftermath of the plague.{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}} The policy of settling Arab tribesmen on the land proved exceptional; in other conquered areas, such as Iraq, early Arab settlement was mostly confined to newly-built [[amsar|garrison cities]].{{sfn|Bray|1996|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAmwas was replaced as the Arabs' headquarters in [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]] first by [[Lydda]] and/or [[Jerusalem]], followed by [[Ramla]], which was founded by the Umayyad caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] in the early 8th century.{{sfn|Sourdel-Thomine|1960|p=460}}{{sfn|Luz|1997|pp=30-31}} As late as the 1870s a well in the [[Imwas|village of Amwas]] bore the name ''bir al-ta'un'' (well of the plague).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clermont-Ganneau |first1=M. |title=Quarterly Statement |date=1874 |publisher=R.

The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliphs routinely withdrew from Syria's cities to their Syrian [[desert castles|desert palaces]] during recurrences of the plague epidemic.]]\n\nThere were recurrences of the plague in Syria\u2013Palestine about every decade between 688/89 and 744/45.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} \"The [[Umayyad dynasty|Umaiyad ''[sic]'' dynasty]] was literally plagued by this disease\", in the words of Dols.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380}} The deaths of the Umayyad caliphs [[Mu'awiya II]] ({{reign|683|684}}), [[Marwan I]] ({{reign|684|685}}), [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|685|705}}), Sulayman ({{reign|715|717}}) and the Umayyad governors in Iraq [[al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba]] ({{reign|661|671}}) and [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] ({{reign|685|673}}) may all possibly have been caused by the plague epidemics in Syria and Iraq.{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=378\u2013380}}{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=55}} The caliphs routinely withdrew from the cities to their [[desert castles|desert palaces]] when the plague emerged during the summer months.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380}} Notable among them was Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] ({{reign|724|743}}), who preferred his palace at [[Resafa|Rusafa]] over Damascus because he viewed the latter to be unhealthy.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=380, note 97}}\n\nDols speculates that the frequent recurrences may have consistently undercut natural population growth in Syria\u2013Palestine, the center of the Umayyad Caliphate, and weakened Umayyad power.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} Concurrently, Arab tribal migrations into the far eastern province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], which was apparently spared from the plague epidemics, may have led to the lopsided growth and predominance of the eastern half of the Caliphate and the rise of the [[Abbasid Revolution|Abbasid Movement]] there, which ultimately toppled the Umayyads in 750.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=381}} In the view of Conrad, by the end of these plague cycles, the Umayyads has lost practical control of the eastern Caliphate and \"it is tempting to view the interminable plagues of the last years of the dynasty as an important factor in the victory of the Abbasid revolution\".{{sfn|Bray|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Theological interpretations===\nModern historians concur that the actual circumstances of the plague of Amwas are not reconstructable and largely focus on the descriptions of the event in the 8th\u201310th-century Islamic histories and collections of [[hadith]] (traditions and sayings of Muhammad) in the context of theological debates on [[predestination]], the status of Muslim sinners, and contagion.<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/> The plague of Amwas received more attention in medieval Arabic literature than any other epidemic until the 14th-century [[Black Death]].{{sfn|Conrad|1981|p=167}} Representations of the plague by the sources were \"varied and contradictory\", according to the historian Justin K. Stearns.<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/> The narratives of the response to the plague by Muhammad's companions Umar, Abu Ubayda, Amr and Mu'adh informed Muslim religious and legal interpretations of plague throughout the Middle Ages, including the response to the Black Death.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}<ref name=\"Stearns29\"/>  \n\nMedieval Muslim scholars derived three principals from the contemporary reactions to the plague of Amwas: the first was that the plague was a form of divine mercy or martyrdom for the Muslim faithful and a punishment to non-believers; the second was the prohibition on Muslims entering or fleeing plague-stricken lands; and the third was the plague was not a contagion, rather it was directly imposed by God.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} The tenets consistently caused theological disagreements throughout the epidemic recurrences of the Middle Ages as a result of the difficulty in accepting plague as divine mercy or punishment and observable contagion.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}}\n\nIn the assessment of Dols, native Christian and Jewish attitudes and natural human anxieties likely influenced aspects of the first principle, namely that plague represented divine punishment or warnings. Muslims in this camp related the plague to lax morals among the Muslim troops in Syria, such as the consumption of wine, which supposedly led Umar to order the lashing of drinkers. On the other hand, the interpretation of plague as mercy or martyrdom is evident in Abu Ubayda's speeches to the troops at Amwas and in the council at Sargh.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=377}} A poem about the plague of Amwas recorded by the [[Damascus|Damascene]] historian [[Ibn Asakir]] (d. 1175) reflects the martyrdom belief: <blockquote>How many brave horsemen and how many beautiful, chaste women were killed in the valley of 'Amwas <br /> They had encountered the Lord, but He was not unjust to them <br /> When they died, they were among the non-aggrieved people in Paradise. <br /> We endure the plague as the Lord knows, and we were consoled in the hour of death.{{sfn|Dols|1974|pp=377\u2013378}}</blockquote>\n\nOn the principle of predestination, the events of Amwas were used to argue that whether a person fled or remained in a plague-affected area their death had already been decreed by God.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} During an episode of plague in the Iraqi garrison city of [[Kufa]], the prominent statesman and scholar [[Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]] (d. 662) turned away visitors to his home due to someone in his household having the plague, and he justified Muslims fleeing plague on the basis of Umar's actions at Sargh.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}} According to Dols, this also implied a recognition of contagion despite the contradiction with the purported hadith rejecting contagion as a pre-Islamic theory.{{sfn|Dols|1974|p=378}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Athamina |first1=Khalil |title=The Appointment and Dismissal of Kh\u0101lid b. al-Wal\u012bd from the Supreme Command: A Study of the Political Strategy of the Early Muslim Caliphs in Syria |journal=Arabica |date=July 1994 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=253\u2013272 |ref=harv |publisher=Brill |jstor=4057449 |doi=10.1163/157005894X00191}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Biesterfeldt |first1=Hinrich |last2=G\u00fcnther |first2=Sebastian |title=The Works of Ibn W\u0101\u1e0di\u1e25 al-Ya\u02bfq\u016bb\u012b (Volume 3): An English Translation |date=2018 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-35621-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHxTDwAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bray |first1=R.

Dami\u00e1n did not know that Carolina was already married to Santiago \u00c1lvarado ([[Carlos Ferro (Mexican actor)|Carlos Ferro]]), a construction architect with whom she has two children. When Raquel drops off her son Fede at school, she accidentally backs her car to Santiago's truck, and they realize that their sons know each other. Raquel volunteers to pay for the damages but Santiago refuses. Raquel insists and goes to the \u00c1lvarado home with Dami\u00e1n. The two couples become great friends. But the desire between Dami\u00e1n and Carolina is stronger than their marriage commitment and both decide to deceive to their spouses. Dami\u00e1n and Carolina have a terrible car accident.

Dami\u00e1n did not know that Carolina was already married to Santiago \u00c1lvarado ([[Carlos Ferro (Mexican actor)|Carlos Ferro]]), a construction architect with whom she has two children. When Raquel drops off her son Fede at school, she accidentally backs her car to Santiago's truck, and they realize that their sons know each other. Raquel volunteers to pay for the damages but Santiago refuses. Raquel insists and goes to the \u00c1lvarado home with Dami\u00e1n. The two couples become great friends. But the desire between Dami\u00e1n and Carolina is stronger than their marriage commitment and both decide to deceive to their spouses. Dami\u00e1n and Carolina have a terrible car accident.

The film was remade in [[Cinema of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi film]] as [[Black Money (2015 film)|Black Money]] in (2015) starting [[Symon Sadik]] and [[Moushumi Hamid]].  \n\n==Plot==\nA minister of Andhra Pradesh Cabinet named Kalamoorthy is removed from his post after the Central Bureau of Investigation proves his involvement in Liquor Mafia and the Election Commission of India declares the first by election after the main elections of that term in that constituency. While a senior ruling party leader Saradhi ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]) is willing to spend {{INR}}25 crore for the election, other senior members ask Sanyasi Naidu ([[Charan Raj]]) to shell out {{INR}}50 crores and if he wins in the by election, he would become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Since it is his ambition to rule the state, Sanyasi Naidu accepts to spend {{INR}}50 crores. With the help of his trusted aid, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sanyasi Naidu brings {{INR}}50 crores to India through Hawala transaction into Old City in Hyderabad. The ACP is tasked with transporting the money to the constituency. On completion of the task and if Sanyasi Naidu becomes the Chief Minister, then the ACP would be promoted as Inspector General (IG) of Police. The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.\n\nAnother story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.\n\nTo save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the {{INR}}50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.\n\nDaniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.\n\nSanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the {{INR}}50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.\n\nOnce Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took {{INR}}50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the {{INR}}49.5 crores, he donates {{INR}}45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one. The rest {{INR}}4.5 cores are retained by Prakash with which he starts a very successful Sherwani business in Dubai with his wife and friends as employees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nani (actor)|Nani]] as Prakash\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Noor\n* Sidhika Sharma as Sweety\n* [[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]] as Saradhi\n* [[Charan Raj]] as Sanyasi Naidu\n* Raja Ravindra as Daniel\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as Daniel's subordinate\n* Akbar Bin Tabar as Prakash's friend\n* R.K. as Yadav\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter Krishna Vamsi's failure [[Mogudu (film)|Mogudu]], he began working on his next film.

The film was remade in Bangladeshi film as Black Money in (2015) starting Symon Sadik.  \n\n==Plot==\nA minister of Andhra Pradesh Cabinet named Kalamoorthy is removed from his post after the Central Bureau of Investigation proves his involvement in Liquor Mafia and the Election Commission of India declares the first by election after the main elections of that term in that constituency. While a senior ruling party leader Saradhi ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]) is willing to spend {{INR}}25 crore for the election, other senior members ask Sanyasi Naidu ([[Charan Raj]]) to shell out {{INR}}50 crores and if he wins in the by election, he would become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Since it is his ambition to rule the state, Sanyasi Naidu accepts to spend {{INR}}50 crores. With the help of his trusted aid, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sanyasi Naidu brings {{INR}}50 crores to India through Hawala transaction into Old City in Hyderabad. The ACP is tasked with transporting the money to the constituency. On completion of the task and if Sanyasi Naidu becomes the Chief Minister, then the ACP would be promoted as Inspector General (IG) of Police. The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.\n\nAnother story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.\n\nTo save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the {{INR}}50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.\n\nDaniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.\n\nSanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the {{INR}}50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.\n\nOnce Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took {{INR}}50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the {{INR}}49.5 crores, he donates {{INR}}45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one. The rest {{INR}}4.5 cores are retained by Prakash with which he starts a very successful Sherwani business in Dubai with his wife and friends as employees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nani (actor)|Nani]] as Prakash\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Noor\n* Sidhika Sharma as Sweety\n* [[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]] as Saradhi\n* [[Charan Raj]] as Sanyasi Naidu\n* Raja Ravindra as Daniel\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as Daniel's subordinate\n* Akbar Bin Tabar as Prakash's friend\n* R.K. as Yadav\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter Krishna Vamsi's failure [[Mogudu (film)|Mogudu]], he began working on his next film.

The film\u2019s theme song, \u2018Paisa Theme\u2019, is highly entertaining and music director Sai Karthik has done a very good job with this number. Among the other tracks, \u2018Govindaa Govindaa\u2019 \u2018Neetho Edho\u2019 and \u2018Mayya Mayya\u2019 are good. Sai Karthik has played a safe game, by coming up with pleasant but slightly routine music. Krishna Vamsi is known for coming up with very good visuals for his songs, so let us see what magic he can do this time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/paisa-pleasant-tunes.html|title=Audio Review : Paisa \u2013 Pleasant Tunes|publisher=123telugu.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref> ''IndiaGlitz'' gave a review stating \"It is time for yet another Krishna Vamsi audio \u2013 something where each song is driven by the needs of the  script rather than any other extraneous consideration.
