In May 1831, Page moved his family to [[Thompson Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Thompson, Ohio]], under [[Lucy Mack Smith]]'s direction. He again moved his family to [[Jackson County, Missouri]], in 1832 and joined the Latter Day Saints gathering there. With the other Whitmers, they formed a cluster of ten or twelve homes called the \"Whitmer Settlement\". Hiram owned {{convert|120|acre|m2}} of land in the area.\n\nDuring the growing [[anti-Mormon]] hostilities in  Jackson County, Page was severely beaten by a group of non-Mormon vigilantes on October 31, 1833. On July 31 and August 6, 1834, he testified to the facts of the beatings. By 1834, Page and his family were expelled along with the other Latter Day Saints, and lived for a time in neighboring [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], before moving to [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]].\n\nWhen the members of the Whitmer family were excommunicated from the church in 1838 Page withdrew from church fellowship. <ref>https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/5142/</ref>He later bought a farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri|Excelsior Springs]], back in Clay County.\n\nOn September 6, 1847, [[William E.

McLellin ordained Page a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] in the church. Page participated in the subsequent ordinations of the others.\n\nPage died on his farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]], still affirming his testimony of the Book of Mormon.

Page agreed to discard the stone and the revelations and join in following Smith as the sole [[prophet, seer, and revelator|revelator]] for the church. The members present confirmed this unanimously [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|with a vote]]. The fate of the stone and revelations was not recorded by contemporary sources and has been the subject of interest ever since.<ref name=MacKay2016 />  Martin Harris's brother Emer stated second-hand in 1856 that the stone was ground to powder and the associated revelations were burned.<ref>Emer Harris statement, in Utah Stake General Minutes, Local Record 9629, ser. 11, vol. 10 (1855-60), 6 April 1856, Church History Library.</ref>  Apostle [[Alvin R.

(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968), 257-259</ref>  The validity of this claim has been questioned.<ref name=MacKay2016 />\n\nIn January 1831, Page accompanied [[Lucy Mack Smith]] and a company of saints from [[Waterloo, New York]], to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on the [[Erie Canal]], on their way to [[Fairport Harbor, Ohio|Fairport]] and [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. In May 1831, Page moved his family to [[Thompson Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Thompson, Ohio]], under [[Lucy Mack Smith]]'s direction. He again moved his family to [[Jackson County, Missouri]], in 1832 and joined the Latter Day Saints gathering there. With the other Whitmers, they formed a cluster of ten or twelve homes called the \"Whitmer Settlement\". Hiram owned {{convert|120|acre|m2}} of land in the area.\n\nDuring the growing [[anti-Mormon]] hostilities in  Jackson County, Page was severely beaten by a group of non-Mormon vigilantes on October 31, 1833. On July 31 and August 6, 1834, he testified to the facts of the beatings. By 1834, Page and his family were expelled along with the other Latter Day Saints, and lived for a time in neighboring [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], before moving to [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]].\n\nWhen the members of the Whitmer family were excommunicated from the church in 1838 Page withdrew from church fellowship. <ref>https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/5142/</ref>He later bought a farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri|Excelsior Springs]], back in Clay County.\n\nOn September 6, 1847, [[William E. McLellin]] baptized Page, [[David Whitmer]], [[John Whitmer]], and [[Jacob Whitmer]] into his newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]]. McLellin ordained Page a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] in the church. Page participated in the subsequent ordinations of the others.\n\nPage died on his farm in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]], still affirming his testimony of the Book of Mormon. His death was caused when his wagon overturned, crushing him underneath.\n\nFor almost 150 years, the final resting place of Page was unknown.<ref name=Burial>{{cite news|last=Shull|first=Sharon|title=Hiram Page's grave identified|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2001-01-06/hiram-pages-grave-identified-19011|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=Deseret News|date=6 January 2001}}</ref> However, in 2000, it was located near Excelsior Springs, on property purchased by Charles and Molly Fulkerson in 1917.<ref name=Burial/> Page's burial location was the last of the 11 Book of Mormon witnesses to be identified.<ref name=Burial/> A commemorative marker was placed on Page's grave on April 27, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray County Genealogy: A Missouri GenWeb Project: Historical Markers: Hiram Page|url=http://ray.mogenweb.org/markers/page/page.htm|publisher=Kentucky Comprehensive Genealogy Database|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{cite web|title=The Joseph Smith Papers Project: Page, Hiram: Biography|url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/person/hiram-page|publisher=The Church Historian's Press: The Church History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=11 February 2014}}\n*{{cite news|last=Mays|first=Kenneth|title=Picturing history: Hiram Page's grave|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765617012/Picturing-history-Hiram-Pages-grave.html?pg=all|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=Deseret News|date=5 December 2012}}\n*{{cite book | last = Jenson | first = Andrew | title = Latter-day Saint biographical encyclopedia: A compilation of biographical sketches of prominent men and women in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | volume = 1 | year = 1901 | publisher = The Andrew Jenson History Company (Printed by The Deseret News Press) | location = Salt Lake City, Utah | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=o3LUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Latter-Day%20Saint%20Biographical%20Encyclopedia%2C%20vol%201&pg=PA277#v=onepage&q&f=false 277\u2013278]}}\n* {{findagrave|6289884}}\n\n{{Book of Mormon Witnesses}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2015}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Page, Hiram}}\n[[Category:1800 births]]\n[[Category:1852 deaths]]\n[[Category:American Latter Day Saint leaders]]\n[[Category:19th-century American physicians]]\n[[Category:Book of Mormon witnesses]]\n[[Category:Road incident deaths in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Latter Day Saint leaders]]\n[[Category:People from Fayette, New York]]\n[[Category:People from Vermont]]\n[[Category:Converts to Mormonism]]\n[[Category:People excommunicated by the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]]\n[[Category:Whitmer family]]\n[[Category:Doctrine and Covenants people]]\n[[Category:Religious leaders from Vermont]]\n[[Category:People from Excelsior Springs, Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Epachamo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed earlier citation error.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Page"}
