The project cost the [[Yakima School District]] over $108 million. The development of the athletic amenities was a large reason to why the district had went over the initial budget of $108 million. New athletic amenities included on campus baseball fields, tennis courts, soccer practice fields and football practice fields. These amenities added $7.3 million to the total cost of the project. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/yakima-school-district-completes-million-worth-of-school-improvements/article_f6d68972-6fe4-11e5-a232-a75009bb28f1.html|title=Yakima School District completes $200 million worth of school improvements|last=Guerrero|first=Rafael|date=October 10, 2015|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nThe new high school was built in a L-shaped configuration with the student commons being located at the corner. This design was incorporated to create loop circulation for the reduction of congestion and giving students alternate pathways to their destinations. By the student commons are the auditorium, foyer, gym, entry spaces, the administrative offices, and security offices. As a focal point, the school's entrance has a prominently positioned glass-enclosed public entry and second-story library. The academic spaces surround the central courtyard on three sides. This design allows natural light to shine into all of the classrooms. The fitness and weight facilities are located on the second floor and overlook the outdoor sports fields. The locker rooms are right underneath. Finally, the auditorium seats 800 people and has practice spaces down the hall. Following these practice space are practice spaces for the band and choir.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://kdaarchitecture.com/project/eisenhower-high-school/|title=Big Thing|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=KDA Architecture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nSince its unveiling in 2013, the new Eisenhower High School building has won several awards for its concept and design execution. These awards include the following: the AIA Central Washington Merit Award, the Learning by Design Outstanding Project Award, the MIW Excellence in Masonry Design Honor Award, the Inland Northwest AGC Build Northwest Award, and the Robert Faser Masonry Design Award.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== KDA Architecture and Graham Construction Lawsuit ===\nSix years after its opening in August, 2013, the Yakima School District filed a lawsuit against KDA Architecture because of design issues, and property damage of the building's signature blue wall. The lawsuit was about the specific changes that were made from initial design flaws<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/yakima-school-district-files-lawsuit-against-architects-builder-over-ike/article_865f64ef-26f2-5614-b9d5-6e4f190f98b1.html|title=Yakima School District files lawsuit against architects, builder over Ike blue wall|last=Retka|first=Janelle|date=July 1, 2019|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>. These changes contributed to the problems found throughout the building. The district also involved Graham Construction in the lawsuit for failing to install and effectively implement all elements of the design. The lawsuit states that in April 2013, the water-resistant material behind the tiles of the blue wall was melting. After further investigation, it was found that the tiles on the blue wall were heating up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and causing them to melt.<ref name=\":4\" /> The Blue Wall hadn't been repaired until September 2017. The 750 foot wall cost the Yakima School District $547,280. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/ike-s-big-blue-wall-repairs-nearly-complete-at-a/article_0b0dedda-a1b2-11e7-ba68-2b6fc892149a.html|title=Ike's big 'Blue Wall' repairs nearly complete at a cost of a half-million dollars|last=Oliver|first=Miles|date=September 24, 2017|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>  \n\nAdditional flaws in the building were spotted by Eisenhower staff and faculty members after they had moved into the building in late August, 2013. After two months inside the new location, there were multiple reports of severe flaws, most notably water had been leaking through the wall and into the school's interior. The lawsuit also states that the leaking and damages were occurring because of the improper design, installation, poor workmanship, and a lack of flashing. In turn, the district had sued for over breach of contract and professional negligence amongst other things. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yaktrinews.com/yakima-school-district-sues-over-design-issues-property-damage-with-ikes-blue-wall/|title=Yakima School District sues over design issues, property damage with IKE\u2019s blue wall|last=Goodell|first=Emily|date=2020-12-12|website=YakTriNews|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> \n\nKDA Architecture and Graham Construction have yet to respond publicly on the lawsuit filed against them. Both have contributed in making repairs to the building and the blue wall, but not free of expenses. Both companies have continued projects in the Yakima Valley, including YV-Technical Institute. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kdaarchitecture.com/project/yakima-valley-technical-skills-center/|title=Yakima Valley Technical Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular Activities ==\nEisenhower High School offers sports for student all throughout the year and provides students the opportunity to compete with other schools in Washington state.

The project cost the [[Yakima School District]] over $108 million. The development of the athletic amenities was a large reason to why the district had went over the initial budget of $108 million. New athletic amenities included on campus baseball fields, tennis courts, soccer practice fields and football practice fields. These amenities added $7.3 million to the total cost of the project. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/yakima-school-district-completes-million-worth-of-school-improvements/article_f6d68972-6fe4-11e5-a232-a75009bb28f1.html|title=Yakima School District completes $200 million worth of school improvements|last=Guerrero|first=Rafael|date=October 10, 2015|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nThe new high school was built in a L-shaped configuration with the student commons being located at the corner. This design was incorporated to create loop circulation for the reduction of congestion and giving students alternate pathways to their destinations. By the student commons are the auditorium, foyer, gym, entry spaces, the administrative offices, and security offices. As a focal point, the school's entrance has a prominently positioned glass-enclosed public entry and second-story library. The academic spaces surround the central courtyard on three sides. This design allows natural light to shine into all of the classrooms. The fitness and weight facilities are located on the second floor and overlook the outdoor sports fields. The locker rooms are right underneath. Finally, the auditorium seats 800 people and has practice spaces down the hall. Following these practice space are practice spaces for the band and choir.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://kdaarchitecture.com/project/eisenhower-high-school/|title=Big Thing|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=KDA Architecture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\nSince its unveiling in 2013, the new Eisenhower High School building has won several awards for its concept and design execution. These awards include the following: the AIA Central Washington Merit Award, the Learning by Design Outstanding Project Award, the MIW Excellence in Masonry Design Honor Award, the Inland Northwest AGC Build Northwest Award, and the Robert Faser Masonry Design Award.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== KDA Architecture and Graham Construction Lawsuit ===\nSix years after its opening in August, 2013, the Yakima School District filed a lawsuit against KDA Architecture because of design issues, and property damage of the building's signature blue wall. The lawsuit was about the specific changes that were made from initial design flaws<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/yakima-school-district-files-lawsuit-against-architects-builder-over-ike/article_865f64ef-26f2-5614-b9d5-6e4f190f98b1.html|title=Yakima School District files lawsuit against architects, builder over Ike blue wall|last=Retka|first=Janelle|date=July 1, 2019|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>. These changes contributed to the problems found throughout the building. The district also involved Graham Construction in the lawsuit for failing to install and effectively implement all elements of the design. The lawsuit states that in April 2013, the water-resistant material behind the tiles of the blue wall was melting. After further investigation, it was found that the tiles on the blue wall were heating up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and causing them to melt.<ref name=\":4\" /> The Blue Wall hadn't been repaired until September 2017. The 750 foot wall cost the Yakima School District $547,280. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/education/ike-s-big-blue-wall-repairs-nearly-complete-at-a/article_0b0dedda-a1b2-11e7-ba68-2b6fc892149a.html|title=Ike's big 'Blue Wall' repairs nearly complete at a cost of a half-million dollars|last=Oliver|first=Miles|date=September 24, 2017|website=Yakima Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>  \n\nAdditional flaws in the building were spotted by Eisenhower staff and faculty members after they had moved into the building in late August, 2013. After two months inside the new location, there were multiple reports of severe flaws, most notably water had been leaking through the wall and into the school's interior. The lawsuit also states that the leaking and damages were occurring because of the improper design, installation, poor workmanship, and a lack of flashing. In turn, the district had sued for over breach of contract and professional negligence amongst other things. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yaktrinews.com/yakima-school-district-sues-over-design-issues-property-damage-with-ikes-blue-wall/|title=Yakima School District sues over design issues, property damage with IKE\u2019s blue wall|last=Goodell|first=Emily|date=2020-12-12|website=YakTriNews|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> \n\nKDA Architecture and Graham Construction have yet to respond publicly on the lawsuit filed against them. Both have contributed in making repairs to the building and the blue wall, but not free of expenses. Both companies have continued projects in the Yakima Valley, including YV-Technical Institute. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kdaarchitecture.com/project/yakima-valley-technical-skills-center/|title=Yakima Valley Technical Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular Activities ==\nEisenhower High School offers sports for student all throughout the year and provides students the opportunity to compete with other schools in Washington state.

In late 1997, [[Linda Tripp]] began secretly recording conversations with her friend [[Monica Lewinsky]], a former intern and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] employee. In those recordings, Lewinsky divulged that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton. Tripp shared this information with Jones's lawyers, who added Lewinsky to their witness list in December 1997. According to the ''[[Starr Report]]'', a U.S. federal government report written by appointed Independent Counsel Ken Starr on his investigation of President Clinton, after Lewinsky appeared on the witness list Clinton began taking steps to conceal their relationship. Some of the steps he took included suggesting to Lewinsky that she file a false [[affidavit]] to misdirect the investigation, encouraging her to use cover stories, concealing gifts he had given her, and attempting to help her find gainful employment to try to influence her testimony.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn a January 17, 1998 sworn deposition, Clinton denied having a \"sexual relationship\", \"sexual affair\", or \"sexual relations\" with Lewinsky.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Starr |first1=Kenneth |title=The Starr Report Pt.

Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented \"an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard to remove the President from office\".<ref name=\"historyplace\" /> January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.\n\nOn January 25, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Representative Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56\u201344, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Senator [[Russ Feingold]] again voting with the Republicans.\n\nOver three days, February 1\u20133, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend [[Vernon Jordan]], and White House aide [[Sidney Blumenthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/us/president-s-trial-overview-senators-see-lewinsky-tape-vernon-jordan-testifies.html|title=THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: THE OVERVIEW; Senators See Lewinsky Tape And Vernon Jordan Testifies|first=Francis X.|last=Clines|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1999|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref> On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70\u201330 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.\n\nOn February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:\n{{quote|There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\nChief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:\n{{quote|A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious{{nbsp}}... We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President{{nbsp}}... And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\n=== Verdict ===\n\nOn February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]], 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict on either charge and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against, and the [[obstruction of justice]] charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against.<ref name=WaPo02131999/><ref name=CNN21299>{{cite news| title=How the senators voted on impeachment| date=February 12, 1999| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/| publisher=CNN| accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ClintonDA>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref> Senator [[Arlen Specter]] voted \"[[not proven|not proved]]\"{{efn|a verdict used in [[Scots law]]}} for both charges,<ref>{{cite news | author = Specter, Arlen | title = Senator Specter's closed-door impeachment statement | date = February 12, 1999 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.statements/specter.html | publisher = CNN | accessdate = March 13, 2008 | quote = My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved.

A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Senator [[Russ Feingold]] again voting with the Republicans.\n\nOver three days, February 1\u20133, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend [[Vernon Jordan]], and White House aide [[Sidney Blumenthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/us/president-s-trial-overview-senators-see-lewinsky-tape-vernon-jordan-testifies.html|title=THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: THE OVERVIEW; Senators See Lewinsky Tape And Vernon Jordan Testifies|first=Francis X.|last=Clines|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1999|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref> On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70\u201330 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.\n\nOn February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:\n{{quote|There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\nChief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:\n{{quote|A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious{{nbsp}}... We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President{{nbsp}}... And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\n=== Verdict ===\n\nOn February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]], 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict on either charge and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against, and the [[obstruction of justice]] charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against.<ref name=WaPo02131999/><ref name=CNN21299>{{cite news| title=How the senators voted on impeachment| date=February 12, 1999| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/| publisher=CNN| accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ClintonDA>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref> Senator [[Arlen Specter]] voted \"[[not proven|not proved]]\"{{efn|a verdict used in [[Scots law]]}} for both charges,<ref>{{cite news | author = Specter, Arlen | title = Senator Specter's closed-door impeachment statement | date = February 12, 1999 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.statements/specter.html | publisher = CNN | accessdate = March 13, 2008 | quote = My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved.

The President has dodged perjury by calculated evasion and poor interrogation.
