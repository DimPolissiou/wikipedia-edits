The band's name spoofs that of another band, [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]].\n\nTo date, Ugly Kid Joe have released four full-length albums, two compilation albums and two EPs. Their best selling records are ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' (1991) and ''[[America's Least Wanted]]'' (1992), which were both certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]];<ref name=\"RIAA albums\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=ugly_kid_joe&perPage=25 |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - August 20, 2010: Ugly Kid Joe certified albums|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> the former is notable for being the first EP to go platinum.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&format=short_form_album&perPage=25 RIAA Gold & Platinum Database] (sort by \"Certification Date\")</ref> The band broke up in 1997, but announced a reunion in 2010.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/uglykidjoetheband Facebook] - Ugly Kid Joe</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history (1990\u20131991)===\nChildhood friends [[Whitfield Crane]],  and Klaus Eichstadt took an interest in music while growing up in [[Palo Alto, California]]. In 1989 Lambert and Eichstadt had joined Crane's band in Isla Vista, California. After the trio recorded a demo with another Palo Alto native, record producer [[Eric Valentine]]. After several band member changes, the band signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1991. By this time the ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' line-up was formed; consisting of Crane, Eichstadt, Mark Davis, Roger Lahr, and Cordell Crockett.<ref name=\"mtvke\">{{cite web|title=Ugly Kid Joe's Klaus Eichstadt|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/570216/ugly-kid-joes-klaus-eichstadt/|website=MTV|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>. \n\nNamed \"Overdrive\", the band got its name Ugly Kid Joe as a parody of L.A. glam band [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]], initially for a one night show in Santa Barbara opening for Pretty Boy Floyd. Pretty Boy Floyd would pull out of the show and have the gig cancelled, but the band decided to keep the name.<ref name=\"mtvke\" />\n\nThe band became popular in the early 1990s, mixing satirical humor and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Its logo was a cartoon embodiment of an \"ugly kid\" wearing a backwards baseball hat and giving [[the finger]]. Heavily influenced by [[Black Sabbath]], Ugly Kid Joe covered several of the veteran band's songs, including \"[[Sweet Leaf]]\" and \"[[N.I.B.]]\" The group toured the [[United States]] several times, making its second tour in support of [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], and later opening for former Black Sabbath lead vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]].\n\nThe band released the E.P. ''As Ugly As They Wanna Be'' in October 1991, garnering success in 1992 with the single \"[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]\", which peaked at No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made it into the Billboard Top 10. Later in the year, the song would be used in the movie ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. ''As Ugly As They Wanna Be'' went on to sell over 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone.\n\n===Commercial success (1992\u20131996)===\nThe band spent 2 months in the studio to record ''[[America's Least Wanted]]''. During the process, Roger Lahr left the band due to musical differences and was eventually replaced by [[Sugartooth]] guitarist [[Dave Fortman]] in April 1992. [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]] was a guest vocalist on the song \"Goddamn Devil\". The band sped up the recording process for their album in order to get a spot as a supporting act for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"No More Tears\" tour. The band eventually landed a spot for the tour, only to have Crane fly back to L.A. several times to finish edits on the album. The album caused controversy with its cover, which features the band's mascot posing as the Statue of Liberty holding up the middle finger and holding a porno magazine in his hand instead of the hallowed Declaration. As some stores would not carry the album due to the cover image, the band decided to have an alternative cover made with the band's mascot chained and gagged.\n\n''America's Least Wanted'' appeared on the U.S. charts at No. 27 having sold over 600,000 units upon release and was considered a favorite among fans and critics. One critic praised the album as, \"A rock record you can play all day.\" The album achieved Gold status in both Canada and Australia, Silver status in the United Kingdom, and went Platinum in the U.S.A. A cover of [[Harry Chapin]]'s \"[[Cat's in the Cradle]]\" was subsequently released as a well-received single that sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe band would open for Ozzy Osbourne, and thereafter for [[Def Leppard]] for their European leg of the tour which was sold-out in 6 weeks. The band made a stop at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s. The band spent 3 weeks playing sold-out shows in Australia and Japan. Ugly Kid Joe became the Reader's Choice for Best New Artist voted by ''[[Metal Edge]]'' and ''[[Raw magazine (rock)|Raw]]'' magazine.\n\nThey also presented The Favorite Heavy Metal band award to [[Metallica]] at the [[American Music Award]]s in 1993. The band would also get nominated for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist but lost to [[Pearl Jam]].\n\nAfter their tour in support of their 1992 album ''America's Least Wanted'', the band searched for a replacement drummer, as Mark Davis left to pursue a life away from the spotlight. The band tried out for new drummers, such as Bob Fernandez who only appeared on a cover of Black Sabbath's \"[[N.I.B.]]\" for the ''[[Nativity in Black]]'' Black Sabbath tribute album. He also showed up in Brazil with the band at the [[Hollywood Rock]] festival in 1994 as headliners along with [[Aerosmith]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], among others.  After attending a [[Souls at Zero (band)|Souls at Zero]] show in Colorado, Crane became immediately impressed with the band's drummer, [[Shannon Larkin]]. Crane later called up Larkin to join Ugly Kid Joe to which Larkin agreed. The band then wrote some new song material with Larkin and embarked on a short tour titled the \"Excuse To Go Snowboarding Tour\" with guests [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] and [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]]. Larkin's contributions led to a grittier sound for the second album ''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'', released in the summer of 1995. The album was recorded in Palacio Del Rio in northern Santa Barbara.\n\nThe band embarked on a tour in support of the album. They did a snowboard tour, a small club tour, and later a stadium tour opening for [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Van Halen]]. The band excluded \"Everything About You\" from their set list in order to show the fans that they stand tall on their recent material. At a show in Wembley Stadium in London, the band was joined on stage by Ozzy Osbourne's son, [[Jack Osbourne]] before playing Sabbath's \"N.I.B\".\n\n''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'' received much praise from the press and fans, and [[United Kingdom|UK]] rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it as a contender for album of the year. Despite success overseas and a successful [[Europe]]an tour, the album was given little encouragement from [[Mercury Records]] and subsequently failed in the United States.\n\nAfter being dropped by Mercury, Ugly Kid Joe formed its own independent label, Evilution Records, for the release of the band's next album. With distribution support from [[Castle Communications]], ''[[Motel California]]'' was released in late 1996, and again the band toured Europe to smaller crowds. The tour was named \"Late Check-out Tour\", underlining the band's characteristic sense of humor. ''Motel California'', an album lead vocalist [[Whitfield Crane]] described as \"heavy, funky, and has everything in it\", initially received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, though it has gained a minor cult following in recent times.\n\n===Break-up and aftermath (1997\u20132009)===\nUgly Kid Joe disbanded in 1997. Drummer Shannon Larkin has been a member of [[Godsmack]] since 2002, while lead vocalist Whitfield Crane took the then vacant vocalist spot for [[New York City]] rock band [[Life of Agony]] whose former singer [[Keith Caputo]] had left the group in 1997. After his quick departure from Life of Agony, Crane collaborated with some [[Soulfly]] members on a new project called [[Medication (band)|Medication]] (1999\u20132003) and Godsmack members on [[Another Animal]] (2006\u20132009).\n\nIn 2005, an unreleased video for \"Bicycle Wheels\" was made public onto the Ugly Kid Joe forum site (created in January 2004 by J.Goldman, aka DMJ, a fan from Isra\u00ebl). In 2007, an official Myspace page was made of the band, with old photographs of the band and other candid pictures along with promotional artwork and uploaded live footage and another unreleased music video for \"Sandwich\". Some of the other footage included footage of the band playing at the UC Santa Barbara campus before getting signed. Soon videos were turning up on YouTube by fans, some included live recordings of them in concert and television recordings. Meanwhile, the band's main page featured live tracks and rare songs including a demo of \"C.U.S.T.\" and a few tracks from ''Motel California'' and ''Menace to Sobriety''.\n\n===Reunion (2010\u2013present)===\nKlaus Eichstadt stated in the December 2009 issue of the German edition of the music magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', that the members of Ugly Kid Joe were planning to reunite in summer 2010, although did not specify whether their intent was to produce a new album or simply to perform together. However, rumors of a reunion were confirmed on their MySpace page on May 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/uglykidjoetheband |title=UGLY KID JOE &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |website=Myspace.com |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref> Their MySpace page also says that the reunion lineup will be the same as the last one before their breakup.\n\nAs of July 2011, according to drummer [[Shannon Larkin]], a new album has been completed. He revealed the album's status in an interview with California's [[KSAN (FM)|107.7 The Bone]] at the [[Mayhem Festival]], saying \"It's a fun band \u2013 it's funny, you listen to the songs and it makes you laugh.

According to official website \"also in the works is an [[EPK]] documenting the reunification and the latest recording sessions along with some rare old footage of interviews, behind the scenes stuff, and live performances\".\n\nThe new EP, ''[[Stairway to Hell]]'', was released digitally on June 5, 2012, while physical version surfaced a month later, July 9.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |title=UGLY KID JOE: 'Devil's Paradise' Video Released |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120719151951/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |archivedate=July 19, 2012 }}</ref> In order to promote the recording, Ugly Kid Joe played a series of festivals that summer, including [[Sweden Rock Festival|Sweden Rock]] in Sweden, [[Download Festival|Download]] in England, [[Gods of Metal]] in Milan, Italy, and Belgrade Calling in Serbia.

The band's name spoofs that of another band, [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]].\n\nTo date, Ugly Kid Joe have released four full-length albums, two compilation albums and two EPs. Their best selling records are ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' (1991) and ''[[America's Least Wanted]]'' (1992), which were both certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]];<ref name=\"RIAA albums\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=ugly_kid_joe&perPage=25 |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - August 20, 2010: Ugly Kid Joe certified albums|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> the former is notable for being the first EP to go platinum.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&format=short_form_album&perPage=25 RIAA Gold & Platinum Database] (sort by \"Certification Date\")</ref> The band broke up in 1997, but announced a reunion in 2010.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/uglykidjoetheband Facebook] - Ugly Kid Joe</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history (1990\u20131991)===\nChildhood friends [[Whitfield Crane]],  and Klaus Eichstadt took an interest in music while growing up in [[Palo Alto, California]]. In 1989 Lambert and Eichstadt had joined Crane's band in Isla Vista, California. After the trio recorded a demo with another Palo Alto native, record producer [[Eric Valentine]]. After several band member changes, the band signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1991. By this time the ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'' line-up was formed; consisting of Crane, Eichstadt, Mark Davis, Roger Lahr, and Cordell Crockett.<ref name=\"mtvke\">{{cite web|title=Ugly Kid Joe's Klaus Eichstadt|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/570216/ugly-kid-joes-klaus-eichstadt/|website=MTV|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>. \n\nNamed \"Overdrive\", the band got its name Ugly Kid Joe as a parody of L.A. glam band [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]], initially for a one night show in Santa Barbara opening for Pretty Boy Floyd. Pretty Boy Floyd would pull out of the show and have the gig cancelled, but the band decided to keep the name.<ref name=\"mtvke\" />\n\nThe band became popular in the early 1990s, mixing satirical humor and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Its logo was a cartoon embodiment of an \"ugly kid\" wearing a backwards baseball hat and giving [[the finger]]. Heavily influenced by [[Black Sabbath]], Ugly Kid Joe covered several of the veteran band's songs, including \"[[Sweet Leaf]]\" and \"[[N.I.B.]]\" The group toured the [[United States]] several times, making its second tour in support of [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], and later opening for former Black Sabbath lead vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]].\n\nThe band released the E.P. ''As Ugly As They Wanna Be'' in October 1991, garnering success in 1992 with the single \"[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]\", which peaked at No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made it into the Billboard Top 10. Later in the year, the song would be used in the movie ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. ''As Ugly As They Wanna Be'' went on to sell over 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone.\n\n===Commercial success (1992\u20131996)===\nThe band spent 2 months in the studio to record ''[[America's Least Wanted]]''. During the process, Roger Lahr left the band due to musical differences and was eventually replaced by [[Sugartooth]] guitarist [[Dave Fortman]] in April 1992. [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]] was a guest vocalist on the song \"Goddamn Devil\". The band sped up the recording process for their album in order to get a spot as a supporting act for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"No More Tears\" tour. The band eventually landed a spot for the tour, only to have Crane fly back to L.A. several times to finish edits on the album. The album caused controversy with its cover, which features the band's mascot posing as the Statue of Liberty holding up the middle finger and holding a porno magazine in his hand instead of the hallowed Declaration. As some stores would not carry the album due to the cover image, the band decided to have an alternative cover made with the band's mascot chained and gagged.\n\n''America's Least Wanted'' appeared on the U.S. charts at No. 27 having sold over 600,000 units upon release and was considered a favorite among fans and critics. One critic praised the album as, \"A rock record you can play all day.\" The album achieved Gold status in both Canada and Australia, Silver status in the United Kingdom, and went Platinum in the U.S.A. A cover of [[Harry Chapin]]'s \"[[Cat's in the Cradle]]\" was subsequently released as a well-received single that sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe band would open for Ozzy Osbourne, and thereafter for [[Def Leppard]] for their European leg of the tour which was sold-out in 6 weeks. The band made a stop at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s. The band spent 3 weeks playing sold-out shows in Australia and Japan. Ugly Kid Joe became the Reader's Choice for Best New Artist voted by ''[[Metal Edge]]'' and ''[[Raw magazine (rock)|Raw]]'' magazine.\n\nThey also presented The Favorite Heavy Metal band award to [[Metallica]] at the [[American Music Award]]s in 1993. The band would also get nominated for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist but lost to [[Pearl Jam]].\n\nAfter their tour in support of their 1992 album ''America's Least Wanted'', the band searched for a replacement drummer, as Mark Davis left to pursue a life away from the spotlight. The band tried out for new drummers, such as Bob Fernandez who only appeared on a cover of Black Sabbath's \"[[N.I.B.]]\" for the ''[[Nativity in Black]]'' Black Sabbath tribute album. He also showed up in Brazil with the band at the [[Hollywood Rock]] festival in 1994 as headliners along with [[Aerosmith]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], among others.  After attending a [[Souls at Zero (band)|Souls at Zero]] show in Colorado, Crane became immediately impressed with the band's drummer, [[Shannon Larkin]]. Crane later called up Larkin to join Ugly Kid Joe to which Larkin agreed. The band then wrote some new song material with Larkin and embarked on a short tour titled the \"Excuse To Go Snowboarding Tour\" with guests [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] and [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]]. Larkin's contributions led to a grittier sound for the second album ''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'', released in the summer of 1995. The album was recorded in Palacio Del Rio in northern Santa Barbara.\n\nThe band embarked on a tour in support of the album. They did a snowboard tour, a small club tour, and later a stadium tour opening for [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Van Halen]]. The band excluded \"Everything About You\" from their set list in order to show the fans that they stand tall on their recent material. At a show in Wembley Stadium in London, the band was joined on stage by Ozzy Osbourne's son, [[Jack Osbourne]] before playing Sabbath's \"N.I.B\".\n\n''[[Menace to Sobriety (Ugly Kid Joe album)|Menace to Sobriety]]'' received much praise from the press and fans, and [[United Kingdom|UK]] rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it as a contender for album of the year. Despite success overseas and a successful [[Europe]]an tour, the album was given little encouragement from [[Mercury Records]] and subsequently failed in the United States.\n\nAfter being dropped by Mercury, Ugly Kid Joe formed its own independent label, Evilution Records, for the release of the band's next album. With distribution support from [[Castle Communications]], ''[[Motel California]]'' was released in late 1996, and again the band toured Europe to smaller crowds. The tour was named \"Late Check-out Tour\", underlining the band's characteristic sense of humor. ''Motel California'', an album lead vocalist [[Whitfield Crane]] described as \"heavy, funky, and has everything in it\", initially received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, though it has gained a minor cult following in recent times.\n\n===Break-up and aftermath (1997\u20132009)===\nUgly Kid Joe disbanded in 1997. Drummer Shannon Larkin has been a member of [[Godsmack]] since 2002, while lead vocalist Whitfield Crane took the then vacant vocalist spot for [[New York City]] rock band [[Life of Agony]] whose former singer [[Keith Caputo]] had left the group in 1997. After his quick departure from Life of Agony, Crane collaborated with some [[Soulfly]] members on a new project called [[Medication (band)|Medication]] (1999\u20132003) and Godsmack members on [[Another Animal]] (2006\u20132009).\n\nIn 2005, an unreleased video for \"Bicycle Wheels\" was made public onto the Ugly Kid Joe forum site (created in January 2004 by J.Goldman, aka DMJ, a fan from Isra\u00ebl). In 2007, an official Myspace page was made of the band, with old photographs of the band and other candid pictures along with promotional artwork and uploaded live footage and another unreleased music video for \"Sandwich\". Some of the other footage included footage of the band playing at the UC Santa Barbara campus before getting signed. Soon videos were turning up on YouTube by fans, some included live recordings of them in concert and television recordings. Meanwhile, the band's main page featured live tracks and rare songs including a demo of \"C.U.S.T.\" and a few tracks from ''Motel California'' and ''Menace to Sobriety''.\n\n===Reunion (2010\u2013present)===\nKlaus Eichstadt stated in the December 2009 issue of the German edition of the music magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', that the members of Ugly Kid Joe were planning to reunite in summer 2010, although did not specify whether their intent was to produce a new album or simply to perform together. However, rumors of a reunion were confirmed on their MySpace page on May 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/uglykidjoetheband |title=UGLY KID JOE &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |website=Myspace.com |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref> Their MySpace page also says that the reunion lineup will be the same as the last one before their breakup.\n\nAs of July 2011, according to drummer [[Shannon Larkin]], a new album has been completed. He revealed the album's status in an interview with California's [[KSAN (FM)|107.7 The Bone]] at the [[Mayhem Festival]], saying \"It's a fun band \u2013 it's funny, you listen to the songs and it makes you laugh.

According to official website \"also in the works is an [[EPK]] documenting the reunification and the latest recording sessions along with some rare old footage of interviews, behind the scenes stuff, and live performances\".\n\nThe new EP, ''[[Stairway to Hell]]'', was released digitally on June 5, 2012, while physical version surfaced a month later, July 9.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |title=UGLY KID JOE: 'Devil's Paradise' Video Released |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120719151951/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=174478 |archivedate=July 19, 2012 }}</ref> In order to promote the recording, Ugly Kid Joe played a series of festivals that summer, including [[Sweden Rock Festival|Sweden Rock]] in Sweden, [[Download Festival|Download]] in England, [[Gods of Metal]] in Milan, Italy, and Belgrade Calling in Serbia.

It was built as a memorial to the museum's founder, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]], and her husband, [[James Watson Webb II]]. It is home to the museum's European Paintings Collection. The collection is shown in six period rooms relocated from Electra and J. Watson Webb's 1930s New York City apartment at 740 [[Park Avenue]].<ref name=\"shelburnemuseum.org\">http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=9</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1960, Electra Havemeyer Webb's children erected the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building in honor of the museum founder. Completed in 1967, the Memorial Building's silhouette duplicates that of the 1843 Wilcox-Cutts House in [[Orwell, Vermont]]. The Memorial Building represents the architectural idiom known as [[Greek Revival]]. It was a style pervasive in the United States, gaining prominence in the second quarter of the 19th century and reaching its peak of popularity by 1850.<ref name=\"shelburnemuseum.org\"/>\n\nDrawing inspiration from Grecian temples, Greek Revival architects adopted the rectangular structure of colonial houses and reoriented it so that the triangular gables would run parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the road. Anchoring the pedimented facade with a heavily columned, often two-storied porch, and sometimes flanking the main gable with mirroring wings, such as in the Memorial Building, architects achieved the proportion and symmetry of the ancient structures that inspired them.<ref>Shelburne Museum. 1993. ''Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections''. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.</ref>\n\n==Collections==\n===Bronze sculptures===\nShelburne Museum's bronze collection focuses on small decorative bronzes. Bronze castings of exotic animals by French artist [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] can be seen in the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building. His small sculptures of elephants, crocodiles and lions are displayed in the library. Barye spent hours at the Paris zoo sketching the anatomy of animals to accurately reproduce them in bronze. His sculpture elephant and driver, located in the foyer captures the rough skin of an elephant and the contrasting soft cloth costume of his driver. \n\nOn the first floor, there are two [[Edgar Degas]] bronzes. The horse and rider combinations were originally modeled in wax and later cast in bronze (after the artist's death in 1917). Degas' studies of horses and jockeys was a way to explore the effects of form, space, and motion.\n\nIn the basement of the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building there is a collection of 19th and 20th century American bronzes. It features work by such western artists as [[Charles Marion Russell]] and [[Harry Jackson (artist)|Harry Jackson]]; these artists, who often served as [[cowhand]]s and guides of the western plains, modeled their work after real people and personal experiences. Their [[bucking bronco]]s, cowboys, and portraits of Native Americans are romantic interpretations of a vanishing American west.\n\n===European paintings===\nShelburne Museum's collection of fine art includes objects originally in the collection of [[Henry O. Havemeyer]] and [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer]], parents of Electra Havemeyer Webb who inherited the collection from them. The European painters still represented by the collection include [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Mary Cassatt]]. The Havemeyers were among the first American collectors of French Impressionist painting and amassed one of the most important collections of [[Old Master]]s and [[Impressionist]] paintings on American soil. \n\nThe French artist \u00c9douard Manet (1832\u20131883) felt strongly that keen observation made a great painter. A brilliant technician who used broad strokes of paint as comfortably as he did minute dabs of color, Manet explored ideas about light that set the stage for the Impressionist movement. He completed ''Blue Venice'' while touring [[Italy]] in 1874. His dashes of paint create the effect of sunlight sparkling on water; on the [[gondolier]], Manet used multiple strokes of color to create a three-dimensional effect.\n\nClaude Monet (1840\u20131926), a prominent leader of the Impressionist movement, stressed the importance of working outdoors and letting art illustrate the color and movement of the natural environment. Five landscapes by Monet are included in the museum's collection. In the 1880s and 1890s Monet captured the changing effects of natural light by creating series of paintings of the same subject in different weather and light conditions. His ''Haystacks in the Snow'' is part of a series of over thirty paintings of haystacks. \n\nPastels, soft, colorful chalks, were perfected by the French in the 19th century. Edgar Degas is considered one of the founders of Impressionism though he preferred to be considered a [[realism (arts)|Realist]]. Degas's work differed from other Impressionists; while Monet concentrated on the effects of light and shadow, Degas focused on unusual perspectives and complex formal structures. The Shelburne Museum has seven Degas works in the collection, which can be seen in the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building.\n\n[[Mary Cassatt]], the one American Impressionist in the collection, had close ties to the Havemeyer and Webb families. Louisine Elder Havemeyer, Electra Havemeyer Webb's mother, was a close friend to Cassatt, who played a large role in shaping the Havemeyers' French Impressionist collection. The Memorial Building includes a Cassatt portrait of the museum's founder, Electra Havemeyer Webb, and her mother Louisine Elder Havemeyer.\n\n===Furniture===\nThe Shelburne Museum's furniture collection represents the different styles and tastes of 18th and 19th century America. It includes examples of the most sophisticated urban furniture produced in the nation as well as many simpler pieces made by country cabinetmakers for use in rural homes. These country pieces include one of the greatest strengths of the museum \u2013 its collection of paint-decorated furniture. \n\nDuring the American industrial revolution (ca. 1865-1900) the furniture industry, like every other major industry, was mechanized. Individual craftspeople and designers like [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work can be seen in the Memorial Building, continued to work for upper class patrons, but inexpensive, factory-made chairs, tables, beds, and stands flooded an eager market of middle-class Victorians. The popularity of carved decoration and elaborate upholstery, characteristic of the period, can be seen on the furniture displayed in the parlor of the [[Colchester Reef Light|Lighthouse]] and on the promenade deck of the [[Ticonderoga (steamboat)|''Ticonderoga'']] steamboat.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Hamlin, Talbot and Sarah Hull Jenkins Simpson Hamlin.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Lancashire]], it was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1867 and merged with [[Dalton-in-Furness Urban District]] in 1974 to form the [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Borough of Barrow-in-Furness]]. At the tip of the [[Furness|Furness peninsula]], close to the [[Lake District]], it is bordered by [[Morecambe Bay]], the [[Duddon Estuary]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. In 2011, Barrow's population was 57,000, making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], although it is geographically closer to the whole of Lancashire and most of [[Merseyside]]. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as [[Barrovian]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first=Russell | last=Jenkins | title=Chocolate blog sends town into meltdown | date=22 December 2006 |journal=The Times | pages=15 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Barrow was a small [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with [[Furness Abbey]], now on the outskirts of the modern-day town, controlling the local economy before its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1537. The iron prospector [[Henry Schneider]] arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the [[Furness Railway]] in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further [[hematite]] deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period of the late 19th century, the [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]]-owned steelworks was the world's largest.<ref>[http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ Barrow Steelworks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819160207/http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ |date=19 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nBarrow's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during [[World War I]] and the local yard's specialisation in submarines. The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after [[World War II]], leaving [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers]] shipyard as Barrow's main industry and employer. Several [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy Fleet Flagship|flagships]], the vast majority of its [[Nuclear submarine#Royal Navy of the United Kingdom|nuclear submarines]] as well as numerous other naval vessels, [[ocean liner]]s and [[oil tanker]]s have been manufactured at the facility.\n\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] and subsequent [[peace dividend|decrease in military spending]] saw high unemployment in the town through lack of contracts; despite this, the [[BAE Systems]] shipyard remains operational as the UK's largest by workforce and is undergoing a major expansion associated with the {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|0}} submarine programme.<ref name=\"unemployment\" /> Today Barrow is a hub for energy generation and handling.

This was later renamed Old Barrow, recorded as Oldebarrey in 1537, and Old Barrow Insula and Barrohead in 1577. The island was then joined to the mainland and the town took its name. The name itself seems to mean \"island with promontory\", combining British ''barro-'' and Old Norse ''ey'', but it is more likely that [[Scandinavia]]n settlers simply accepted ''barro-'' as a meaningless name, and so added an explanatory [[Old Norse]] second element.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Mills|first= David|title= The Place Names of Lancashire|year= 1976|publisher= Batsford Books|location= London|isbn= 978-0-7134-3248-0}}</ref>\n\n===Nicknames===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barrow was nicknamed \"the English Chicago\" because of the sudden and rapid growth in its industry, economic stature and overall size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/barrow-in-furness-kept-on-life-support-by-perpetual-warfare/5011365.article|title=Barrow-in-Furness: kept on life support by perpetual warfare|publisher=}}</ref> More recently the town has been dubbed the \"capital of [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] Britain\" by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', reflecting its strong working class identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1T4ACAW_en___GB384&q=most+working+class+town|title=most working class town \u2013 Google Search|website=www.google.com}}</ref> Barrow is also often jokingly referred to as being at the end of the longest [[cul-de-sac]] in the country because of its isolated location at the tip of the Furness peninsula.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18853714|title=Five lesser-spotted things in the census|first=Lucy Townsend and Kathryn|last=Westcott|date=17 July 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Barrow-in-Furness}}\n\n===Early history===\nBarrow and the surrounding area has been settled non-continuously for several millennia with evidence of [[Neolithic]] inhabitants on [[Walney Island]].

Small quantities of iron and ore were exported from jetties on the channel separating the village from Walney Island.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Lancashire]], it was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1867 and merged with [[Dalton-in-Furness Urban District]] in 1974 to form the [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Borough of Barrow-in-Furness]]. At the tip of the [[Furness|Furness peninsula]], close to the [[Lake District]], it is bordered by [[Morecambe Bay]], the [[Duddon Estuary]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. In 2011, Barrow's population was 57,000, making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], although it is geographically closer to the whole of Lancashire and most of [[Merseyside]]. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as [[Barrovian]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first=Russell | last=Jenkins | title=Chocolate blog sends town into meltdown | date=22 December 2006 |journal=The Times | pages=15 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Barrow was a small [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with [[Furness Abbey]], now on the outskirts of the modern-day town, controlling the local economy before its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in 1537. The iron prospector [[Henry Schneider]] arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the [[Furness Railway]] in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further [[hematite]] deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period of the late 19th century, the [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]]-owned steelworks was the world's largest.<ref>[http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ Barrow Steelworks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819160207/http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/ |date=19 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nBarrow's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during [[World War I]] and the local yard's specialisation in submarines.

[[Walney Island]], to the west of Barrow, surrounds the peninsula's Irish Sea coast and is separated from Barrow by the narrow [[Walney Channel]]. Both Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary are characterized by large areas of [[quicksand]] and fast-moving [[tidal bore]]s. Areas of [[sand dunes]] exist on coasts surrounding Barrow, particularly at [[Roanhead]] and [[North Walney]]. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat coastal shelf, with hillier ground rising to the east of the town, peaking at {{convert|94|m|ft|round=5}} at Yarlside. Barrow sits on soils deposited during the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], eroded from the mountains of the [[Lake District National Park]], {{convert|10|mi|km|round=5}} to the north-east. Barrow's soils are composed of glacial lake clay and [[glacial till]], while Walney is almost entirely made up of reworked glacial morraine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=May|first1=VJ|title=Walney Island|url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2042.pdf|publisher=DEFRA|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"ICE\">{{cite journal|last1=Raison|first1=CA|title=North Morecambe Terminal, Barrow: pile design for seismic conditions|journal=Proceedings of the ICE \u2013 Geotechnical Engineering|date=1999|volume=137|issue=3|page=149\u00b1163|url=http://www.raisonfosterassociates.co.uk/downloads/barrow-piling.pdf|accessdate=16 July 2015|doi=10.1680/gt.1999.370304}}</ref> Beneath these soils is a [[sandstone]] bedrock, from which many of the town's older buildings are constructed.<ref name=\"ICE\" />\n\nBarrow town centre is located to the north-east of the docks, with suburbs also extending to the north and east, as well as onto Walney.

Walney North and [[South Walney|South Nature Reserves]] are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as is [[Sandscale Haws]]. Formal woodland areas within the town include Hawcoat/Ormsgill Quarry, How Tun Woods, [[Abbot's Wood, Cumbria|Abbotswood]], Barrow Steel Works & Slag Bank and Sowerby Wood. The 45-Acre [[Barrow Park]] is the largest and most centrally located man-made park in the town with smaller parks including Channelside Haven, Hindpool Urban Park and Vickerstown Park.

The activities of a fifth column can be overt or clandestine. Forces gathered in secret can mobilize openly to assist an external attack. This term is also extended to organised actions by military personnel. Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, or espionage executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] patrol on the streets of Madrid, 1936]]\nThe term \"fifth column\" originated in Spain (originally ''quinta columna'') during the early phase of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. It gained extreme popularity in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] media since early October 1936, and immediately started to make rounds also abroad.<ref>in French newspapers the term first appeared on October 4, 1936, one day after its first usage in the Madrid press, ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7634839j/f5.item.r=Cinqui%C3%A8me%20colonne.zoom La Passionaria preche la terreur]'', [in:] ''Le Journal'' 04.10.1936. In more distant countries like Poland the term started to appear since mid-October, see e.g. ''[https://polona.pl/item/dziennik-wilenski-r-20-nr-285-18-pazdziernika-1936,MTU3NDQwNDU/0/#info:metadata Oviedo ostatecznie uwolnione]'', [in:] ''Dziennik Wile\u0144ski'' 18.10.1936</ref> \n\nExact origins of the term are not clear. Its first identified appearance was in a secret telegram sent to [[Berlin]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charge d\u2019affaires]] in [[Alicante]], [[:de:Hans Hermann V\u00f6lckers|Hans-Hermann V\u00f6lckers]] dated September 30, 1936. He referred to an unidentified \"supposed statement by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\" which \"is being circulated\" (apparently in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] zone or in the Republican-held [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] zone). In the statement, Franco allegedly claimed that there were four [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] columns approaching Madrid and the fifth column waited to rise from the inside.<ref>Ruiz, Julius (2014), ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=HqBcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185&dq=mola+fifth+column&hl=pl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-l43q3_7nAhVks4sKHU_ZB8YQ6AEIbjAH#v=onepage&q=mola%20fifth%20column&f=false The 'Red Terror' and the Spanish Civil War]'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|9781107054547}}, p. 187</ref> However, the telegram was part of the secret German diplomatic correspondence and was discovered long after the Civil War.\n\nThe first public use of the term identified is in the October 3, 1936 issue of the Madrid [[Communist]] daily ''[[Mundo Obrero]]''. In a front-page article the party propagandist [[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]] referred the same statement as reported by V\u00f6lckers, but attributed it to general [[Emilio Mola]].<ref>the actual copy of ''Mundo Obrero'' is not available for consultation online. Many authors claim that in the article Ibarruri referred to an unidentified Mola's radio broadcast, see e.g. Preston Paul (2011), ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=IsNUHLStdDUC&pg=PT198&lpg=PT198&dq=mola+quinta+columna&source=bl&ots=jKdsKJnw5W&sig=ACfU3U0ZBMg0Q2B9a3vKHX5Uge1Pik9lZg&hl=pl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi68vHu3P7nAhVwkosKHQ7uCaIQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=mola%20quinta%20columna&f=false La Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola: reacci\u00f3n, revoluci\u00f3n y venganza]'', Madrid, {{ISBN|9788499891507}}.

The activities of a fifth column can be overt or clandestine. Forces gathered in secret can mobilize openly to assist an external attack. This term is also extended to organised actions by military personnel. Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, or espionage executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] patrol on the streets of Madrid, 1936]]\nThe term \"fifth column\" originated in Spain (originally ''quinta columna'') during the early phase of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. It gained extreme popularity in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] media since early October 1936, and immediately started to make rounds also abroad.<ref>in French newspapers the term first appeared on October 4, 1936, one day after its first usage in the Madrid press, ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7634839j/f5.item.r=Cinqui%C3%A8me%20colonne.zoom La Passionaria preche la terreur]'', [in:] ''Le Journal'' 04.10.1936. In more distant countries like Poland the term started to appear since mid-October, see e.g. ''[https://polona.pl/item/dziennik-wilenski-r-20-nr-285-18-pazdziernika-1936,MTU3NDQwNDU/0/#info:metadata Oviedo ostatecznie uwolnione]'', [in:] ''Dziennik Wile\u0144ski'' 18.10.1936</ref> \n\nExact origins of the term are not clear. Its first identified appearance was in a secret telegram sent to [[Berlin]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charge d\u2019affaires]] in [[Alicante]], [[:de:Hans Hermann V\u00f6lckers|Hans-Hermann V\u00f6lckers]] dated September 30, 1936. He referred to an unidentified \"supposed statement by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\" which \"is being circulated\" (apparently in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] zone or in the Republican-held [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] zone). In the statement, Franco allegedly claimed that there were four [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] columns approaching Madrid and the fifth column waited to rise from the inside.<ref>Ruiz, Julius (2014), ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=HqBcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185&dq=mola+fifth+column&hl=pl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-l43q3_7nAhVks4sKHU_ZB8YQ6AEIbjAH#v=onepage&q=mola%20fifth%20column&f=false The 'Red Terror' and the Spanish Civil War]'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|9781107054547}}, p. 187</ref> However, the telegram was part of the secret German diplomatic correspondence and was discovered long after the Civil War.\n\nThe first public use of the term identified is in the October 3, 1936 issue of the Madrid [[Communist]] daily ''[[Mundo Obrero]]''. In a front-page article the party propagandist [[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]] referred the same statement as reported by V\u00f6lckers, but attributed it to general [[Emilio Mola]].<ref>the actual copy of ''Mundo Obrero'' is not available for consultation online. Many authors claim that in the article Ibarruri referred to an unidentified Mola's radio broadcast, see e.g. Preston Paul (2011), ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=IsNUHLStdDUC&pg=PT198&lpg=PT198&dq=mola+quinta+columna&source=bl&ots=jKdsKJnw5W&sig=ACfU3U0ZBMg0Q2B9a3vKHX5Uge1Pik9lZg&hl=pl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi68vHu3P7nAhVwkosKHQ7uCaIQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=mola%20quinta%20columna&f=false La Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola: reacci\u00f3n, revoluci\u00f3n y venganza]'', Madrid, {{ISBN|9788499891507}}.

It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an [[abbot]].<ref>Mooney 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central [[cloister]] and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\n\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\n[[File:Ross Friary East Range 2010 09 14.jpg|right|360px]]\nBoth [[Luke Wadding]] and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]] (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as ''Ros-Oirbhealagh'') record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460.<ref>Mooney 12.</ref> The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil.<ref group=note>\"The Friary of Ross\" a History and a Guide.</ref> In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the [[Tyrconnell]] clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\n\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the [[English Reformation]].  The Franciscans had loudly opposed [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII's]] break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\n[[Image:Refriary fish.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|This tank was used to hold live fish caught from the nearby [[Black River (Ireland)|Black River]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd [[Earl of Clanrickarde]].

The refugees were being led from the town of [[Shrule]] when the Catholic soldiers comprising their escort massacred them.  It's not reliably known how many were killed, but one estimate placed the number of victims at 65.  Burke and the monks brought the survivors back to the Headford area and obtained shelter for them among the townspeople until safe passage to England could be arranged.\n\nThe [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Irish campaigns]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] brought an end to this era of English tolerance of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  For a few nervous years, Ross Errilly served as an informal refugee shelter for Catholic clergy who had been flushed out of other parts of Ireland by Cromwell's forces.\n\nOn 10 August 1656, Cromwellian forces finally made their way to Ross Errilly.  The 140 Franciscans living there had fled a few hours earlier, but the soldiers ransacked the grounds, destroying crosses and other religious iconography and even defiling tombs in search of loot.  Legend maintains that the fleeing monks somehow found the time to remove the bell from the bell tower and sink it in the nearby Black River, where it remains today.  The [[English Restoration]] in 1660 brought [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the throne. His nominally tolerant policies towards Catholics allowed the reoccupation and repair of the abbey in 1664.\n\n=== Final years ===\n[[File:Ross Friary Cloister Garden NW Corner 2010 09 14.jpg|right|360px]]\nThe [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], which deposed Charles' younger brother, the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]], eventually led to the [[Popery Act 1698|Popery Act of 1698]], which placed a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Catholic clergy.  Once again, the Franciscans of Ross Errilly became fugitives and abandoned the premises.\n\nLocal records indicate that by 1712, Franciscans had returned to the abbey.  Some sources indicate that the abbey was abandoned again in 1731, for reasons which are unclear.  What's certain is that by 1753, they had returned to the site.  The property was now owned by Lord St. George, a local noble, who picked up where the Clanrickardes had left off and secretly patronised the abbey.  By this time, the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] were in effect and St. George risked life imprisonment by supporting the monks. A vengeful family who had lost a [[lawsuit]] to St. George reported to the authorities that he was sheltering Catholic religious at the monastery.  St. George learned of the accusations and the monks evacuated the monastery for the last time.  Before authorities arrived at the abbey, St. George had the abbey's interior whitewashed and had employed a group of [[weaving|weavers]] and their [[loom]]s inside the building.  The inquiry was ended without further incident, but the sham factory was soon closed and the monks never returned again.\n\nThe monks built cabins of wood and stone on a small island in the Black River, about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) downstream from the abbey.  The island (which no longer exists) was known informally as \"Friars Island,\" and the community supported the monks with food, fuel and clothing via a wooden drawbridge.  For 36 years, the monks continued to celebrate Sunday [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the deteriorating abbey building.  In 1789, a Henry Lynch of [[Ballycurrin]] cheaply leased {{convert|16|acre|m2}} to the dispossessed monks at the foot of a hill in the [[townland]] of Kilroe, near Headford.  By 1801, only three monks remained, though Mass continued to be said at Kilroe until 1804.

It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an [[abbot]].<ref>Mooney 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central [[cloister]] and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\n\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\n[[File:Ross Friary East Range 2010 09 14.jpg|right|360px]]\nBoth [[Luke Wadding]] and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]] (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as ''Ros-Oirbhealagh'') record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460.<ref>Mooney 12.</ref> The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil.<ref group=note>\"The Friary of Ross\" a History and a Guide.</ref> In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the [[Tyrconnell]] clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\n\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the [[English Reformation]].  The Franciscans had loudly opposed [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII's]] break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\n[[Image:Refriary fish.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|This tank was used to hold live fish caught from the nearby [[Black River (Ireland)|Black River]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd [[Earl of Clanrickarde]].  Burgh, a descendant of the de Burghs who had helped found the abbey, quietly gave it back to the Franciscans.  In 1572, an enclosing ditch and wall were constructed around the friary.<ref>Stalley 9.</ref>\n\nIn 1584, the English crown again confiscated the monastery from the Franciscans and gave it to an English noble who evicted the monks and plundered the building's contents.
