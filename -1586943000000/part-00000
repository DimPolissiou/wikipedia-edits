He was paired with numerous wrestlers, including [[Nick Bockwinkel]], whom he led to win the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], and he became an integral figure in the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] by managing [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] in WWF main event matches with [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania 2]] and [[WrestleMania III]] respectively. The wrestlers under his tutelage were collectively known as \"[[The Heenan Family]]\" at various times throughout his career.\n\nKnown for his quick wit and comedic ability, Heenan also served as a color commentator and is remembered for his on-screen repartee with [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Outside of wrestling, Heenan authored two books, appeared on numerous television shows, and briefly hosted a parody talk show titled ''The Bobby Heenan Show'' on ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]''. Heenan retired in 2001 at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] after a seventeen-years stint as a commentator in professional wrestling but he continued to make sporadic appearances in several promotions. In 2002, he was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]], which limited his appearances in later years, and he died from complications of it in 2017.

Born in [[Cardiff]], Bellamy began his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where he made his professional debut in 1996. He went on to play for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Premier League]], becoming the record signing for the former. He was relegated in his single season with Coventry before achieving two top-four finishes during his four years with Newcastle. Bellamy fell out with manager [[Graeme Souness]] in 2005 and spent the latter part of the [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305 season]] on loan at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where he won the [[Scottish Cup]].\n\nBellamy returned to the Premier League later that year, playing one season at both [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], where he was named the club's player of the year, and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In 2007 he signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] but injury disrupted his time there and in 2009 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. For the [[2010-11 in English football|2010\u201311 season]], Bellamy dropped a division to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to represent his boyhood club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a season-long loan. He helped Cardiff reach the playoffs before they were defeated in the semi-finals. Bellamy returned to Liverpool the following season before rejoining Cardiff City permanently in 2012. He later led them to the Premier League; it was the first time in fifty years that Cardiff had played in the top tier of English football. He played one more season with the club in the Premier League, setting a new record by scoring for his seventh different club in the division, before retiring from playing in 2014.\n\nHaving represented Wales at several youth levels, in 1998 at the age of 18, Bellamy made his senior debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Over the next fifteen years, Bellamy gained 78 caps for his country and scored 19 goals. He was the Wales captain from 2007 to 2011, when he stepped down from the role due to injuries. Bellamy retired from international football following the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. He was also a member of the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic team]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] in London, appearing five times and scoring once.\n\nA controversial character, Bellamy was involved in numerous high-profile incidents during his career and was described by [[Bobby Robson]] as \"the gobbiest footballer I've ever met\". Outside football, he has been a patron of several charities and started his own organisation, The Craig Bellamy Foundation, in Sierra Leone to provide schooling and football coaching to disadvantaged children.\n\n==Early life==\nCraig Douglas Bellamy was born on 19 July 1979 at the [[University Hospital of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]],<ref name=\"gf4650\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=46\u201350}}</ref> the second of three boys born to Douglas and Angela Bellamy. At the time of his birth, the family lived on Swindon Street near the [[Splott]] district of the city. The area was considered a traditional working-class environment and had been experiencing an economic downturn following the closure of the East Moor steelworks the previous year. Bellamy's mother worked as a cleaner and his father worked at the nearby Allied Steel and Wire site that overlooked the family home,<ref name=\"gf1718\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> where he remained until the plant's closure in 2002.<ref name=\"walker\"/> With both his parents working full-time, Bellamy spent most of his school holidays at his paternal grandmother Mary's home in [[Adamsdown]].<ref name=\"gf3435\"/> He suffers from [[asthma]]; as a child he made frequent visits to hospital to manage the condition.<ref name=\"uhw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |title=Bellamy\u2019s high praise for \u2018special\u2019 hospital |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141603/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the age of five, Bellamy and his family moved to the eastern suburb [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]], which is part of a council estate built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"gf1718\"/>\n\nBellamy's father was a keen football fan who supported [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and Bellamy's first experience of professional football was watching a [[Football League Fourth Division]] match between Cardiff and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] during the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]], which the home side won 4\u20130. His father played amateur football for local Cardiff-based sides; Bellamy described him as a \"sluggish right-back\".<ref name=\"gf190193\"/> Bellamy's interest in the sport grew rapidly; he regularly attended Cardiff matches at the club's home ground [[Ninian Park]] and played in ABC Park near his home with his older brother Paul and his friends. Bellamy credits playing against older children as making him \"into a better player very quickly\".<ref name=\"gf1920\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> He first attended Baden Powell Primary School before switching to Trowbridge Juniors where he joined the school football team at the age of seven.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |title=Hungry Bellamy sets sights on discovering dreamland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Walker |first=Michael |date=8 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141605/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being younger than most of the other players, he was selected to play and featured in his first match against Gladstone Primary School. Local team Pentwyn Dynamos took an interest in Bellamy but were put off by his small size; his father instead offered to form a team if Bellamy could find enough players. Soon after, the under-10s side of local team Caer Castell FC, which included Bellamy&nbsp;\u2013&#32;who scored all four goals in the club's first fixture&nbsp;\u2013&#32;was formed. He was later picked to represent both Cardiff Schools and a Cardiff and District side in national competition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> He went on to attend [[Rumney High School]].<ref name=\"gf2425\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=24\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |title=Craig Bellamy |publisher=Rumney High School |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203234029/http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |archivedate=3 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, Bellamy was friends with a group of mostly older boys and began to regularly drink alcohol and skipped school for up to two weeks at a time.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/><ref name=\"gf2630\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> He saw several of his friends using [[cannabis]] and [[Glue sniffing|sniffing glue]] but Bellamy never used the substances himself. He later admitted to acting as a lookout while his friends broke into vehicles to steal car stereos to sell for drug money. He described himself as \"a kid who knew he was going to be a footballer and thought he knew it all\".<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> By age 14, Bellamy was barely attending school and was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol everyday.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> In 1993, he met his future wife Claire after being introduced by his brother Paul; Bellamy credits the relationship as a key factor in moving him away from his early troubles.<ref name=\"gf3435\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=34\u201335}}</ref>\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Bristol Rovers and Norwich City ===\nBellamy had attended youth sessions organised by Cardiff City in [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] for a year after being encouraged by his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |title=City vow to learn from Bellamy blunder |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530193157/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] after being spotted by former professional [[Stan Montgomery]], who was working for the club. Although an hour's drive from his family home, Bellamy found the opportunity of better coaching and his own playing kit irresistible. He spent two years at the club before being invited by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to a trial match in Somerset. He impressed Norwich and the club asked Bellamy to  travel with the side to compete in the [[Dana Cup]], an international youth football tournament held in [[Hj\u00f8rring]], Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich's youth development side.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/> Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] offered his parents \u00a310,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] contract when he was old enough to sign.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/>\n\nAt the age of 15, Bellamy moved away from Cardiff to start his youth apprenticeship with Norwich, being placed with a local family along with another apprentice.<ref name=\"gf3640\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=36\u201340}}</ref> Bellamy had previously travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as \"the hardest year of my life\", regularly crying himself to sleep at night after suffering from homesickness.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with [[John Polston]] but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to \"humiliate\" him.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy's homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, [[Tom Ramasut]], but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later said Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited the conception of his first child as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, \"I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=44}}</ref> At the end the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player coach [[Mike Phelan]] promoted to the club's reserve side.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=42}}</ref>\n\nBellamy signed his first professional contract with Norwich, earning \u00a3250 a week, with the option to renegotiate after 10 first-team appearances.<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> He made his professional debut for Norwich on 15 March 1997 under manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], as an injury-time substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. Remarking on the rushed nature of his appearance, he said, \"It all felt very last minute. I was wearing a kit about three sizes too big for me, I touched the ball twice, we lost 2\u20130 and it was over.\"<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> Two further appearances from the bench in fixtures against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] followed before the end of the season.<ref name=ssn9697/> Bellamy made his first career start in the opening month of the following season in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 12 August 1997, and started in the league for the first time on 20 September against Manchester City.<ref name=ssn9798/> During the early stages of the campaign, Bellamy played his 10th match for the first team, leading to new contract negotiations. Despite an attempt by [[Premier League]] side Crystal Palace to sign him for a fee of \u00a32 million, he chose to extend his deal with Norwich.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=53}}</ref> On 1 November, Bellamy scored his first senior goal, the opener in a 2\u20132 home draw with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. He received his first career [[Penalty_card#Red_card|red card]] on 7 February 1998 in the 23rd minute against Manchester City, but finished his first full season with 13 goals from 38 appearances, while playing mostly as a central midfielder.<ref name=ssn9798/>\n\nAs a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\"<ref name=\"gf5657\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after [[Kevin Scott (footballer)|Kevin Scott]] repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] who struck up a friendship with Bellamy.<ref name=\"gf5657\"/> [[Bruce Rioch]] was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career [[hat-trick]] on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]],<ref name=ssn9899/> and he was rewarded with a new five-year contract.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=60}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, Bellamy injured his left knee following a high challenge by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] defender [[Kevin Muscat]] that ruled him out for two months and left him with a puncture wound in his kneecap caused by one of Muscat's studs.<ref name=\"gf7678\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The tackle caused so much consternation that his Norwich teammate [[Iwan Roberts]] later admitted taking revenge on Muscat by stamping on his back when the pair met in a match two years later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |title=Roberts could face ban |newspaper=East Anglia Daily Times |date=29 June 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530200318/https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bellamy continued to experience soreness in the knee after his return for the remainder of the season. In a pre-season friendly against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] prior to the following season, Bellamy ruptured his cruciate ligaments in an innocuous challenge with an opposition defender and was ruled out for between six and eight months.<ref name=\"gf7678\"/> He made his return to the first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 22 April 2000 and finished the season by scoring goals in consecutive matches against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name=\"gf8388\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> Interest in Bellamy grew during the summer; Norwich rejected an offer of \u00a33.5 million by [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] while [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest but held back from making a bid because they were waiting to sell [[Duncan Ferguson]] to finance the transfer.<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\n===Coventry City===\nAs Newcastle stalled over a bid, [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] offered a club-record \u00a36 million to sign Bellamy, which Norwich accepted. Bellamy was reluctant to join the club, preferring a move to Newcastle; he met with Coventry manager [[Gordon Strachan]] to discuss the transfer. Bellamy did not employ an agent at the time so asked his financial advisor to attend the meeting. His advisor had recently met former footballer [[John Fashanu]] and telephoned him for advice, and Fashanu arrived at the meeting unannounced. The pressure of the situation led Bellamy to agree to the move but he regretted his decision, commenting, \"They were persuasive. I felt undermined by the mess with Fashanu. I wanted to save face with Strachan. I felt stressed. My chest was tight because I\u2019m asthmatic. I was struggling to breathe properly because I was so tense. I was in a state. So I did what everybody had told me not to do. I told Strachan I\u2019d sign.\"<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\nBellamy became Coventry's record signing, joining on 16 August 2000 as a replacement for [[Robbie Keane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canary Bellamy To Turn Sky Blue|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|date=16 August 2000|website=cwn.org.uk|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012013948/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]] in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and converted a penalty in the following game, a 2\u20131 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"gf92\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=92}}</ref> He endured a poor start to his career with Coventry, however, scoring only three league goals\u2014two of which were penalties\u2014by the start of December as the club found itself in the relegation zone. On 10 December 2000, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to gain his side three crucial points and Bellamy's form improved further after the arrival of his Wales strike-partner [[John Hartson]]. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season after the team finished 19th in the Premier League, ending 34 consecutive years in the top tier of English football. Bellamy ended his only season at Coventry with eight goals from 39 appearances.

Born in [[Cardiff]], Bellamy began his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where he made his professional debut in 1996. He went on to play for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Premier League]], becoming the record signing for the former. He was relegated in his single season with Coventry before achieving two top-four finishes during his four years with Newcastle. Bellamy fell out with manager [[Graeme Souness]] in 2005 and spent the latter part of the [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305 season]] on loan at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where he won the [[Scottish Cup]].\n\nBellamy returned to the Premier League later that year, playing one season at both [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], where he was named the club's player of the year, and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In 2007 he signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] but injury disrupted his time there and in 2009 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. For the [[2010-11 in English football|2010\u201311 season]], Bellamy dropped a division to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to represent his boyhood club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a season-long loan. He helped Cardiff reach the playoffs before they were defeated in the semi-finals. Bellamy returned to Liverpool the following season before rejoining Cardiff City permanently in 2012. He later led them to the Premier League; it was the first time in fifty years that Cardiff had played in the top tier of English football. He played one more season with the club in the Premier League, setting a new record by scoring for his seventh different club in the division, before retiring from playing in 2014.\n\nHaving represented Wales at several youth levels, in 1998 at the age of 18, Bellamy made his senior debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Over the next fifteen years, Bellamy gained 78 caps for his country and scored 19 goals. He was the Wales captain from 2007 to 2011, when he stepped down from the role due to injuries. Bellamy retired from international football following the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. He was also a member of the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic team]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] in London, appearing five times and scoring once.\n\nA controversial character, Bellamy was involved in numerous high-profile incidents during his career and was described by [[Bobby Robson]] as \"the gobbiest footballer I've ever met\". Outside football, he has been a patron of several charities and started his own organisation, The Craig Bellamy Foundation, in Sierra Leone to provide schooling and football coaching to disadvantaged children.\n\n==Early life==\nCraig Douglas Bellamy was born on 19 July 1979 at the [[University Hospital of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]],<ref name=\"gf4650\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=46\u201350}}</ref> the second of three boys born to Douglas and Angela Bellamy. At the time of his birth, the family lived on Swindon Street near the [[Splott]] district of the city. The area was considered a traditional working-class environment and had been experiencing an economic downturn following the closure of the East Moor steelworks the previous year. Bellamy's mother worked as a cleaner and his father worked at the nearby Allied Steel and Wire site that overlooked the family home,<ref name=\"gf1718\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> where he remained until the plant's closure in 2002.<ref name=\"walker\"/> With both his parents working full-time, Bellamy spent most of his school holidays at his paternal grandmother Mary's home in [[Adamsdown]].<ref name=\"gf3435\"/> He suffers from [[asthma]]; as a child he made frequent visits to hospital to manage the condition.<ref name=\"uhw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |title=Bellamy\u2019s high praise for \u2018special\u2019 hospital |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141603/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the age of five, Bellamy and his family moved to the eastern suburb [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]], which is part of a council estate built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"gf1718\"/>\n\nBellamy's father was a keen football fan who supported [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and Bellamy's first experience of professional football was watching a [[Football League Fourth Division]] match between Cardiff and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] during the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]], which the home side won 4\u20130. His father played amateur football for local Cardiff-based sides; Bellamy described him as a \"sluggish right-back\".<ref name=\"gf190193\"/> Bellamy's interest in the sport grew rapidly; he regularly attended Cardiff matches at the club's home ground [[Ninian Park]] and played in ABC Park near his home with his older brother Paul and his friends. Bellamy credits playing against older children as making him \"into a better player very quickly\".<ref name=\"gf1920\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> He first attended Baden Powell Primary School before switching to Trowbridge Juniors where he joined the school football team at the age of seven.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |title=Hungry Bellamy sets sights on discovering dreamland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Walker |first=Michael |date=8 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141605/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being younger than most of the other players, he was selected to play and featured in his first match against Gladstone Primary School. Local team Pentwyn Dynamos took an interest in Bellamy but were put off by his small size; his father instead offered to form a team if Bellamy could find enough players. Soon after, the under-10s side of local team Caer Castell FC, which included Bellamy&nbsp;\u2013&#32;who scored all four goals in the club's first fixture&nbsp;\u2013&#32;was formed. He was later picked to represent both Cardiff Schools and a Cardiff and District side in national competition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> He went on to attend [[Rumney High School]].<ref name=\"gf2425\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=24\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |title=Craig Bellamy |publisher=Rumney High School |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203234029/http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |archivedate=3 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, Bellamy was friends with a group of mostly older boys and began to regularly drink alcohol and skipped school for up to two weeks at a time.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/><ref name=\"gf2630\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> He saw several of his friends using [[cannabis]] and [[Glue sniffing|sniffing glue]] but Bellamy never used the substances himself. He later admitted to acting as a lookout while his friends broke into vehicles to steal car stereos to sell for drug money. He described himself as \"a kid who knew he was going to be a footballer and thought he knew it all\".<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> By age 14, Bellamy was barely attending school and was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol everyday.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> In 1993, he met his future wife Claire after being introduced by his brother Paul; Bellamy credits the relationship as a key factor in moving him away from his early troubles.<ref name=\"gf3435\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=34\u201335}}</ref>\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Bristol Rovers and Norwich City ===\nBellamy had attended youth sessions organised by Cardiff City in [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] for a year after being encouraged by his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |title=City vow to learn from Bellamy blunder |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530193157/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] after being spotted by former professional [[Stan Montgomery]], who was working for the club. Although an hour's drive from his family home, Bellamy found the opportunity of better coaching and his own playing kit irresistible. He spent two years at the club before being invited by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to a trial match in Somerset. He impressed Norwich and the club asked Bellamy to  travel with the side to compete in the [[Dana Cup]], an international youth football tournament held in [[Hj\u00f8rring]], Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich's youth development side.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/> Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] offered his parents \u00a310,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] contract when he was old enough to sign.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/>\n\nAt the age of 15, Bellamy moved away from Cardiff to start his youth apprenticeship with Norwich, being placed with a local family along with another apprentice.<ref name=\"gf3640\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=36\u201340}}</ref> Bellamy had previously travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as \"the hardest year of my life\", regularly crying himself to sleep at night after suffering from homesickness.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with [[John Polston]] but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to \"humiliate\" him.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy's homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, [[Tom Ramasut]], but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later said Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited the conception of his first child as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, \"I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=44}}</ref> At the end the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player coach [[Mike Phelan]] promoted to the club's reserve side.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=42}}</ref>\n\nBellamy signed his first professional contract with Norwich, earning \u00a3250 a week, with the option to renegotiate after 10 first-team appearances.<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> He made his professional debut for Norwich on 15 March 1997 under manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], as an injury-time substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. Remarking on the rushed nature of his appearance, he said, \"It all felt very last minute. I was wearing a kit about three sizes too big for me, I touched the ball twice, we lost 2\u20130 and it was over.\"<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> Two further appearances from the bench in fixtures against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] followed before the end of the season.<ref name=ssn9697/> Bellamy made his first career start in the opening month of the following season in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 12 August 1997, and started in the league for the first time on 20 September against Manchester City.<ref name=ssn9798/> During the early stages of the campaign, Bellamy played his 10th match for the first team, leading to new contract negotiations. Despite an attempt by [[Premier League]] side Crystal Palace to sign him for a fee of \u00a32 million, he chose to extend his deal with Norwich.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=53}}</ref> On 1 November, Bellamy scored his first senior goal, the opener in a 2\u20132 home draw with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. He received his first career [[Penalty_card#Red_card|red card]] on 7 February 1998 in the 23rd minute against Manchester City, but finished his first full season with 13 goals from 38 appearances, while playing mostly as a central midfielder.<ref name=ssn9798/>\n\nAs a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\"<ref name=\"gf5657\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after [[Kevin Scott (footballer)|Kevin Scott]] repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] who struck up a friendship with Bellamy.<ref name=\"gf5657\"/> [[Bruce Rioch]] was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career [[hat-trick]] on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]],<ref name=ssn9899/> and he was rewarded with a new five-year contract.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=60}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, Bellamy injured his left knee following a high challenge by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] defender [[Kevin Muscat]] that ruled him out for two months and left him with a puncture wound in his kneecap caused by one of Muscat's studs.<ref name=\"gf7678\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The tackle caused so much consternation that his Norwich teammate [[Iwan Roberts]] later admitted taking revenge on Muscat by stamping on his back when the pair met in a match two years later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |title=Roberts could face ban |newspaper=East Anglia Daily Times |date=29 June 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530200318/https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bellamy continued to experience soreness in the knee after his return for the remainder of the season. In a pre-season friendly against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] prior to the following season, Bellamy ruptured his cruciate ligaments in an innocuous challenge with an opposition defender and was ruled out for between six and eight months.<ref name=\"gf7678\"/> He made his return to the first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 22 April 2000 and finished the season by scoring goals in consecutive matches against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name=\"gf8388\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> Interest in Bellamy grew during the summer; Norwich rejected an offer of \u00a33.5 million by [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] while [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest but held back from making a bid because they were waiting to sell [[Duncan Ferguson]] to finance the transfer.<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\n===Coventry City===\nAs Newcastle stalled over a bid, [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] offered a club-record \u00a36 million to sign Bellamy, which Norwich accepted. Bellamy was reluctant to join the club, preferring a move to Newcastle; he met with Coventry manager [[Gordon Strachan]] to discuss the transfer. Bellamy did not employ an agent at the time so asked his financial advisor to attend the meeting. His advisor had recently met former footballer [[John Fashanu]] and telephoned him for advice, and Fashanu arrived at the meeting unannounced. The pressure of the situation led Bellamy to agree to the move but he regretted his decision, commenting, \"They were persuasive. I felt undermined by the mess with Fashanu. I wanted to save face with Strachan. I felt stressed. My chest was tight because I\u2019m asthmatic. I was struggling to breathe properly because I was so tense. I was in a state. So I did what everybody had told me not to do. I told Strachan I\u2019d sign.\"<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\nBellamy became Coventry's record signing, joining on 16 August 2000 as a replacement for [[Robbie Keane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canary Bellamy To Turn Sky Blue|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|date=16 August 2000|website=cwn.org.uk|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012013948/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]] in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and converted a penalty in the following game, a 2\u20131 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"gf92\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=92}}</ref> He endured a poor start to his career with Coventry, however, scoring only three league goals\u2014two of which were penalties\u2014by the start of December as the club found itself in the relegation zone. On 10 December 2000, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to gain his side three crucial points and Bellamy's form improved further after the arrival of his Wales strike-partner [[John Hartson]]. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season after the team finished 19th in the Premier League, ending 34 consecutive years in the top tier of English football. Bellamy ended his only season at Coventry with eight goals from 39 appearances.
