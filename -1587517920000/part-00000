The further route to the Steinh\u00e4usl interchange is basically four lanes, but in gradient areas there is an additional slow lane.\n\nThe two sections of the A 21 at Steinh\u00e4usl and [[Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl]], with a maximum grade of 5.2%, are among the steepest sections of the Austrian motorway network.

The construction of the valley crossings had already begun in 1940. Thus, for example, in Weissenbach or Sittendorf barracks were set up, initially housing regular construction workers, but later serving as accommodation for prisoners of war. Thus, in the Sittendorfer camp, originally relatively well-paid workers from Vienna and the Burgenland, but also from Germany, were housed. In September 1941 Ukrainians came to this camp and were trained as soldiers. Later, prisoners from France and later Serbia came to the camp. The camp housed up to 250 inmates. In 1942, [[typhoid fever]] broke out and claimed numerous victims. After the barracks briefly served as a warehouse for aircraft parts from the Seegrotte, their usage was stopped in the war turmoil like all other construction sites.<ref>[[Nieder\u00f6sterreichische Nachrichten]] on the occasion of the construction of the \"Barackendenkmal\" 2007</ref> Another camp was located on the ''Fischerwiese'' in [[Klausen-Leopoldsdorf]], where [[Romani people|Roma]] were also imprisoned, who had to work as forced laborers on the highway.<ref>Heribert Artinger: ''Chronik der Freistadt Rust, 1850-1950: Tagebuch der kleinsten Stadt \u00d6sterreichs mit eigenem Statut''. </ref> In 1938, a barrack camp was built in Sittendorf, which originally served for the workers and later French prisoners of war, as well as for Serbian forced laborers.

One variant, for example, was to make the A 21 run more southwards from Alland. However, since the [[Helenental]], a narrow valley, would have been too badly affected, this variant was dropped again. It was only in the area of [[Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria|Heiligenkreuz]] that the route was moved further away from the village, so as not to affect the [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]]. In addition, a large part of the land necessary for the construction had already been sold; thus, the further construction was not started until 1964.\n\nOn the first section opened in 1962 between the [[V\u00f6sendorf]] interchange and [[Brunn am Gebirge]], only one directional roadway was available. It was only passable in both directions from 1968 onwards. The last sections between [[Mayerling]] and [[Hinterbr\u00fchl]] were completed in 1982. Furthermore, the highway was planned to continue to Schwechat, where it would become the [[Ost Autobahn|A 4]]. This section was realized in the form of the [[Wiener Au\u00dfenring Schnellstra\u00dfe|S 1]] expressway, which opened in 2006.\n\nSoon after the opening of the continuous motorway, a rest area was to be built at the location of today's Hinterbr\u00fchl rest stop. After partial resistance from the local population, who feared that their habitat would be adversely affected, the plan was dropped and the rest area was built in Alland instead.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#276FB7\" |<span style=\"color:white\"> Opening </span>\n! style=\"background:#276FB7\" |<span style=\"color:white\">Section</span>\n! style=\"background:#276FB7\" |<span style=\"color:white\"> Length</span>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |19.12.1962\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Brunn/Gebirge - Knoten V\u00f6sendorf (right carriageway)\n| align=\"center\" |2.116 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |11.04.1968\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Brunn/Gebirge - Knoten V\u00f6sendorf (left carriageway)\n| align=\"center\" |2.116 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |24.09.1971\n| align=\"center\" |Knoten Steinh\u00e4usl - Klausen-Leopoldsdorf\n| align=\"center\" |13.200 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |07.10.1977\n| align=\"center\" |Klausen-Leopoldsdorf - ASt Mayerling\n| align=\"center\" |4.017 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |24.10.1980\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Hinterbr\u00fchl - ASt Brunn/Gebirge\n| align=\"center\" |10.442 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |29.09.1982\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Heiligenkreuz - ASt Hinterbr\u00fchl\n| align=\"center\" |3.031 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |29.09.1982\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Mayerling - ASt Heiligenkreuz (left carriageway)\n| align=\"center\" |5.437 km\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |29.10.1982\n| align=\"center\" |ASt Mayerling - ASt Heiligenkreuz (right carriageway)\n| align=\"center\" |5.437 km\n|-\n|}\n\n== Accidents ==\nOn the night of 22 February 2010, a German coach bus traveling towards Steinh\u00e4usl collided with a truck in front of it.

It is about a South Korean woman who accidentally [[Emergency landing|crash-lands]] in [[North Korea]]. It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] in South Korea and on [[Netflix]] worldwide from December 14, 2019, to February 16, 2020. It is the highest rated tvN drama and the [[Korean drama#List of highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television|second-highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Crash Landing on You'' tells the story of two [[star crossed lovers]], Yoon Se-ri ([[Son Ye-jin]]), a [[South Korea|South Korean]] [[Chaebol]] heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyeok ([[Hyun Bin]]), a member of the [[North Korea]]n elite and the Captain of the North Korean Special Forces. One day while Yoon Se-ri goes for a short [[paragliding]] ride in [[Seoul]], South Korea, a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find herself up a tree in a forest in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] in North Korea, an area forbidden for South Koreans. There she meets Ri Jeong-hyeok, literally falling into his arms from the tree. Ri Jeong-hyeok eventually gives Yoon Se-ri shelter, and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the [[North Korea\u2013South Korea relations|divide and dispute between their respective countries]].\n\nOne might have expected Se-ri's disappearance to be national news in South Korea. However, Se-ri's family suppresses the news for fear it will depress the stock price of the family-controlled chaebol. In particular, Se-ri's two brothers, Se-jung and Se-hyung, are rivals to succeed their father, who just before Se-ri's disappearance had announced he planned to anoint her because his sons are incompetent. They are supported by their equally ambitious wives, Do Hye-Ji ([[Hwang Woo-seul-hye]]) and Ko Sang-a ([[Yoon Ji-min]]). In fact, Se-hyung finds out Se-ri is in the north and tries to keep her there and then to have her killed.\n\nSe-ri's and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan ([[Seo Ji-hye]]) and Gu Seung-jun ([[Kim_Jung-hyun_(actor,_born_1990)|Kim Jung-hyun]]). Dan is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying cello in Russia for several years but returns so that she can marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage and whom she has only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths, not for the first time, with Gu Seung-jun. Gu Seung-jun, who had previously been engaged to Se-ri, has come to North Korea under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers to escape from the pursuit of Se-ri\u2019s brother Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money. Although their initial encounters are not promising, they too eventually fall in love.\n\nThe story follows Jeong-hyeok and Se-ri as they try to get her home. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang ([[Oh Man-seok]]), an evil and venal State Security officer, who a number of years ago had arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyeok's older brother, an officer who tried to expose him. The story eventually shifts to Seoul where both comedy and drama ensue for all four main characters, Se-ri\u2019s family, and the arch-villain Cho Cheol-gang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Hyun Bin]] as Ri Jeong-hyeok<ref name=\"record\"/>\n: A skilled and dedicated captain in the [[Korean People's Army]] who is from a powerful family (his father is the director of the [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army|General Political Bureau]]).

It is about a South Korean woman who accidentally [[Emergency landing|crash-lands]] in [[North Korea]]. It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] in South Korea and on [[Netflix]] worldwide from December 14, 2019, to February 16, 2020. It is the highest rated tvN drama and the [[Korean drama#List of highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television|second-highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Crash Landing on You'' tells the story of two [[star crossed lovers]], Yoon Se-ri ([[Son Ye-jin]]), a [[South Korea|South Korean]] [[Chaebol]] heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyeok ([[Hyun Bin]]), a member of the [[North Korea]]n elite and the Captain of the North Korean Special Forces. One day while Yoon Se-ri goes for a short [[paragliding]] ride in [[Seoul]], South Korea, a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find herself up a tree in a forest in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] in North Korea, an area forbidden for South Koreans. There she meets Ri Jeong-hyeok, literally falling into his arms from the tree. Ri Jeong-hyeok eventually gives Yoon Se-ri shelter, and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the [[North Korea\u2013South Korea relations|divide and dispute between their respective countries]].\n\nOne might have expected Se-ri's disappearance to be national news in South Korea. However, Se-ri's family suppresses the news for fear it will depress the stock price of the family-controlled chaebol. In particular, Se-ri's two brothers, Se-jung and Se-hyung, are rivals to succeed their father, who just before Se-ri's disappearance had announced he planned to anoint her because his sons are incompetent. They are supported by their equally ambitious wives, Do Hye-Ji ([[Hwang Woo-seul-hye]]) and Ko Sang-a ([[Yoon Ji-min]]). In fact, Se-hyung finds out Se-ri is in the north and tries to keep her there and then to have her killed.\n\nSe-ri's and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan ([[Seo Ji-hye]]) and Gu Seung-jun ([[Kim_Jung-hyun_(actor,_born_1990)|Kim Jung-hyun]]). Dan is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying cello in Russia for several years but returns so that she can marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage and whom she has only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths, not for the first time, with Gu Seung-jun. Gu Seung-jun, who had previously been engaged to Se-ri, has come to North Korea under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers to escape from the pursuit of Se-ri\u2019s brother Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money. Although their initial encounters are not promising, they too eventually fall in love.\n\nThe story follows Jeong-hyeok and Se-ri as they try to get her home. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang ([[Oh Man-seok]]), an evil and venal State Security officer, who a number of years ago had arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyeok's older brother, an officer who tried to expose him. The story eventually shifts to Seoul where both comedy and drama ensue for all four main characters, Se-ri\u2019s family, and the arch-villain Cho Cheol-gang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Hyun Bin]] as Ri Jeong-hyeok<ref name=\"record\"/>\n: A skilled and dedicated captain in the [[Korean People's Army]] who is from a powerful family (his father is the director of the [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army|General Political Bureau]]).

Furthermore, the adjacent natural reserve - [[Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Marsh Natural Reserve|Reserva Natural do Sapal de Castro Marim e Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] - attracts tourists due to its diverse fauna, which comprises some 153 species of birds, including storks, avocets, sandpipers and flocks of flamingos, as well as more than 400 plant species and various reptiles, amphibians and mammals. Its strategic location is also a plus, given that is located adjacent to the cities of [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] and [[Castro Marim]], as well as other nearby touristic attractions such as [[Cacela Velha]] and [[Tavira]].\n\nPrior to the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974, Monte Gordo was a favorite destination for the Portuguese and Spanish aristocracies<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZYEbXT1sOgC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=aristocracia+monte+gordo&source=bl&ots=Ge96dZMr0_&sig=Ru5EMPgOIoJIntMMNu2FSJyMF-8&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM5sGmhObaAhUKxoMKHcUCBcsQ6AEIcDAN#v=onepage&q=aristocracia%20monte%20gordo&f=false|title=Lazer.

With democracy, Monte Gordo became a favorite summer destination for the Portuguese middle class.\n\nMonte Gordo beach is best known for its [https://algarve-south-portugal.com/images/monte-gordo/monte-gordo-sunshine-sun.png sunny weather all year round], as well as for its relatively calm and warm seawater. The average air temperature ranges from a low of 11&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to a high of 26&nbsp;\u00b0C in August, while the average sea temperature ranges from a low of 16&nbsp;\u00b0C in February to a high of 22&nbsp;\u00b0C between July and September, making this the maritime beach with the warmest sea in mainland Portugal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holiday-weather.com/monte_gordo/averages/|title=Weather and temperature averages for Monte Gordo, Portugal|website=www.holiday-weather.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> Another particularity of this beach is the fact that during the low tide one is able to walk 10 to 30 meters into the sea, making it one of the safest in Portugal for children. These conditions make it ideal for beach goers to collect clams lightly buried in the sand (locals call \"conquilhas\" to the local variety of clams).

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Lazzara {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} planing-hull motor yacht in 2014]]\n[[File:Therapy D81 9848 (29134390348).jpg|thumb|Grand Banks {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} trawler-style motor yacht in 2018]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties).

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

They are ideologically aligned with the [[Taliban]], who have worked to eradicate Western influence and transform Afghanistan into a strictly sharia-following state. This was exemplified in the government that formed after Soviet troops were driven from Afghanistan.

Notable jihadists are two well-known Arabs, Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, who both began their careers as volunteers for the Haqqanis and trained to fight the Soviets. [[Al-Qa'ida]] and the Haqqani network, in other words evolved together, and they have remained intertwined throughout their history and remain so to this day.<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\">Brown, V.; Rassler, D.; ''Fountainhead of Jihad: The Haqqani Network, 1973\u20132012''. Columbia University Press 2013.</ref> The Haqqani network's relationship with [[Al-Qaeda]] dates back to the founding of AQ. The significant difference between the two organizations is that Al-Qaeda pursues global goals using global means; whereas Haqqani is solely interested in Afghanistan and the Pashtun Tribal regions. Jalaluddin Haqqani is more interested in the influence of Islamic Law over Afghanistan than the global Jihad but his network has always been fully aware of Al-Qaeda's intentions and goals.\n\nThese two groups are intertwined in tactics, strategy, and Islamic extremism; J. Haqqani realized the importance of Azzam\u2019s \"foundational Islamic legal decisions declaring the Afghan jihad a universally and individually binding duty borne by all Muslims worldwide.\"  Though many Muslim leaders asked for aid from oil wealthy Arab nations in 1978 when Afghan Communists with the backing of the Soviet Union conquered Kabul. J. Haqqani was the only Afghan Islamic Resistance leader to also request foreign Muslim fighters, and was the only group to welcome non-Afghans into its ranks. Thus \"linking it to the broader Jihad struggles and giving birth to the following decade to what would come to be known as global jihadism.\"<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\" /><ref name=\"Fountainhead of Jihad\">''Fountainhead of Jihad''</ref> It is the Haqqani network's use of the Saudi Arabian financiers and other Arab investors in his mission that clearly highlights the groups understanding of Global Jihad. A major difference between the Haqqani network and Al-Qaeda is the spheres of influence they both seek to control.<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\" /><ref name=\"Fountainhead of Jihad\" /> Al-Qaeda's is global, Haqqani's is regional.\n\n[[File:Insurgent Regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Insurgent regions in Afghanistan and border regions of Pakistan, as of 2010]]\n\nMany sources believe Jalaluddin Haqqani and his forces assisted with the escape of Al-Qaeda into safe-havens in Pakistan. Considering how closely the two groups are inter-twined it is not a stretch. It is well documented that the Haqqani network did assist with the establishment of safe-havens. Analyst [[Peter Bergen]] argues this point in his book \"The Battle for Tora Bora\"<ref>\"The Battle for Tora Bora\"</ref><ref>Bergen, Peter; \"The Battle for Tora Bora.\" ''The New Republic'', 30 Dec 2009.</ref><ref>\"Al-Qaeda's Great Escape\"</ref><ref>\"Smucker, Philip; Al-Qaeda's Great Escape: The military and media on Terror's\" Dulles, Virginia, Bassey's 2004.</ref> Judging by the possibilities and the amount of US Military assets focused on such a small region, the theory that the Haqqani network aided in the escape seems reasonable. Regardless of exactly what occurred in those mountains, the Haqqanis played a role. And their actions of providing safe-havens for [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Osama Bin Laden]] show the strength of bond and some role in or knowledge of Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's escape.\n\n===Taliban affiliation===\nForeign jihadists recognized the network as a distinct entity as early as 1994, but Haqqani was not affiliated with the [[Taliban]] until they captured [[Kabul]] and assumed de facto control of [[Afghanistan]] in 1996.<ref name='rassler' /><ref name=\"hinduonnet 19030560\">{{cite news|title=The failing campaign: A relentless American campaign seeking to kill Maulvi [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] rains bombs on civilians as the most powerful mujahideen remains elusive|work=[[The Hindu]]|first=Marc|last=Herold|date=February 2002|issue=3|volume=19 }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> After the Taliban came to power, Haqqani accepted a cabinet-level appointment as Minister of Tribal Affairs.<ref name=\"AsiaTimes040505\">{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/FE05Ag02.html|title=Through the eyes of the Taliban|newspaper=[[Asia Times]]|author=Syed Salaam Shahzaddate=5 May 2004|accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> Following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the subsequent overthrow of the Taliban government, the Haqqanis fled to the bordering Pakistani tribal regions and regrouped to fight against coalition forces across the border.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/us-drone-strike-kills-haqqani-insider/2011/10/13/gIQA5rT3gL_story.html|title=U.S. steps up drone strikes in Pakistan against Haqqani network|work=The Washington Post|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|first=Karen|last=DeYoung}}</ref> As Jalaluddin has grown older his son Sirajuddin has taken over the responsibility of military operations.<ref name=\"NYTimes2008-06-17\" /> Journalist [[Syed Saleem Shahzad]] reported that President [[Hamid Karzai]] invited c. 2002 the elder Haqqani to serve as [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] in an attempt to bring \"moderate\" Taliban into the government.

Haqqani himself was trained in Pakistan during the 1970s, in order to fight Prime Minister Mohammad Daud Khan, who had overthrown the previous ruler (and cousin), King Zahir Shah. During the Soviet invasion, the Pakistani government's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency became close with Haqqani and his organization, allowing them to become a main benefactor of American weapons, intelligence, and training. In the 1990s, Haqqani agreed to join the Taliban, arising to the position of Interior Minister. The United States attempted to convince Haqqani to sever ties with the Taliban, which he refused to do. In 2005 when Merjuddin Pathan was governor of the Khost Province, Haqqani approached him and wanting a dialogue with the Hamid Karzai Government, but neither Americans nor Karzai heeded the pleas of the governor. Afterwards when insurgency accentuated that  Hamid Karzai's leadership  in Afghanistan, approached Haqqani and offered him the position as Minister of Tribal Affairs in his cabinet, which Haqqani has also refused as it was too late. Since the emergence of the Haqqani Network, Haqqani and his family have thrived off of the contacts made by Haqqani during the Cold War.<ref>name=Lawrence, Kendall. \"The Haqqani Network.\" Threat Convergence Profile Series.

They are ideologically aligned with the [[Taliban]], who have worked to eradicate Western influence and transform Afghanistan into a strictly sharia-following state. This was exemplified in the government that formed after Soviet troops were driven from Afghanistan.  Both groups have the common goal of disrupting the Western military and political efforts in Afghanistan and driving them from the country permanently.<ref name=\"Jeffrey Dressler 2010\">\"Jeffrey Dressler; The Haqqani Network, A Strategic Threat.\" Institute for the Study of War 2010.</ref> Currently the group demands that US and Coalition Forces, made up mostly of NATO Nations, withdraw from Afghanistan and no longer interfere with the politics or educational systems of Islamic nations.<ref name=\"Jeffrey Dressler 2010\" />\n\n==History==\nJalaluddin Haqqani joined the [[Hezb-i Islami Khalis]] in 1978 and becoming a [[mujahid]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Notable jihadists are two well-known Arabs, Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, who both began their careers as volunteers for the Haqqanis and trained to fight the Soviets. [[Al-Qa'ida]] and the Haqqani network, in other words evolved together, and they have remained intertwined throughout their history and remain so to this day.<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\">Brown, V.; Rassler, D.; ''Fountainhead of Jihad: The Haqqani Network, 1973\u20132012''. Columbia University Press 2013.</ref> The Haqqani network's relationship with [[Al-Qaeda]] dates back to the founding of AQ. The significant difference between the two organizations is that Al-Qaeda pursues global goals using global means; whereas Haqqani is solely interested in Afghanistan and the Pashtun Tribal regions. Jalaluddin Haqqani is more interested in the influence of Islamic Law over Afghanistan than the global Jihad but his network has always been fully aware of Al-Qaeda's intentions and goals.\n\nThese two groups are intertwined in tactics, strategy, and Islamic extremism; J. Haqqani realized the importance of Azzam\u2019s \"foundational Islamic legal decisions declaring the Afghan jihad a universally and individually binding duty borne by all Muslims worldwide.\"  Though many Muslim leaders asked for aid from oil wealthy Arab nations in 1978 when Afghan Communists with the backing of the Soviet Union conquered Kabul. J. Haqqani was the only Afghan Islamic Resistance leader to also request foreign Muslim fighters, and was the only group to welcome non-Afghans into its ranks. Thus \"linking it to the broader Jihad struggles and giving birth to the following decade to what would come to be known as global jihadism.\"<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\" /><ref name=\"Fountainhead of Jihad\">''Fountainhead of Jihad''</ref> It is the Haqqani network's use of the Saudi Arabian financiers and other Arab investors in his mission that clearly highlights the groups understanding of Global Jihad. A major difference between the Haqqani network and Al-Qaeda is the spheres of influence they both seek to control.<ref name=\"Brown, V. 2012\" /><ref name=\"Fountainhead of Jihad\" /> Al-Qaeda's is global, Haqqani's is regional.\n\n[[File:Insurgent Regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Insurgent regions in Afghanistan and border regions of Pakistan, as of 2010]]\n\nMany sources believe Jalaluddin Haqqani and his forces assisted with the escape of Al-Qaeda into safe-havens in Pakistan. Considering how closely the two groups are inter-twined it is not a stretch. It is well documented that the Haqqani network did assist with the establishment of safe-havens. Analyst [[Peter Bergen]] argues this point in his book \"The Battle for Tora Bora\"<ref>\"The Battle for Tora Bora\"</ref><ref>Bergen, Peter; \"The Battle for Tora Bora.\" ''The New Republic'', 30 Dec 2009.</ref><ref>\"Al-Qaeda's Great Escape\"</ref><ref>\"Smucker, Philip; Al-Qaeda's Great Escape: The military and media on Terror's\" Dulles, Virginia, Bassey's 2004.</ref> Judging by the possibilities and the amount of US Military assets focused on such a small region, the theory that the Haqqani network aided in the escape seems reasonable. Regardless of exactly what occurred in those mountains, the Haqqanis played a role. And their actions of providing safe-havens for [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Osama Bin Laden]] show the strength of bond and some role in or knowledge of Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's escape.\n\n===Taliban affiliation===\nForeign jihadists recognized the network as a distinct entity as early as 1994, but Haqqani was not affiliated with the [[Taliban]] until they captured [[Kabul]] and assumed de facto control of [[Afghanistan]] in 1996.<ref name='rassler' /><ref name=\"hinduonnet 19030560\">{{cite news|title=The failing campaign: A relentless American campaign seeking to kill Maulvi [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] rains bombs on civilians as the most powerful mujahideen remains elusive|work=[[The Hindu]]|first=Marc|last=Herold|date=February 2002|issue=3|volume=19 }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> After the Taliban came to power, Haqqani accepted a cabinet-level appointment as Minister of Tribal Affairs.<ref name=\"AsiaTimes040505\">{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/FE05Ag02.html|title=Through the eyes of the Taliban|newspaper=[[Asia Times]]|author=Syed Salaam Shahzaddate=5 May 2004|accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> Following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the subsequent overthrow of the Taliban government, the Haqqanis fled to the bordering Pakistani tribal regions and regrouped to fight against coalition forces across the border.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/us-drone-strike-kills-haqqani-insider/2011/10/13/gIQA5rT3gL_story.html|title=U.S. steps up drone strikes in Pakistan against Haqqani network|work=The Washington Post|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|first=Karen|last=DeYoung}}</ref> As Jalaluddin has grown older his son Sirajuddin has taken over the responsibility of military operations.<ref name=\"NYTimes2008-06-17\" /> Journalist [[Syed Saleem Shahzad]] reported that President [[Hamid Karzai]] invited c. 2002 the elder Haqqani to serve as [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] in an attempt to bring \"moderate\" Taliban into the government.

Haqqani himself was trained in Pakistan during the 1970s, in order to fight Prime Minister Mohammad Daud Khan, who had overthrown the previous ruler (and cousin), King Zahir Shah. During the Soviet invasion, the Pakistani government's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency became close with Haqqani and his organization, allowing them to become a main benefactor of American weapons, intelligence, and training. In the 1990s, Haqqani agreed to join the Taliban, arising to the position of Interior Minister. The United States attempted to convince Haqqani to sever ties with the Taliban, which he refused to do. In 2005 when Merjuddin Pathan was governor of the Khost Province, Haqqani approached him and wanting a dialogue with the Hamid Karzai Government, but neither Americans nor Karzai heeded the pleas of the governor. Afterwards when insurgency accentuated that  Hamid Karzai's leadership  in Afghanistan, approached Haqqani and offered him the position as Minister of Tribal Affairs in his cabinet, which Haqqani has also refused as it was too late. Since the emergence of the Haqqani Network, Haqqani and his family have thrived off of the contacts made by Haqqani during the Cold War.<ref>name=Lawrence, Kendall. \"The Haqqani Network.\" Threat Convergence Profile Series.

On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now \"fractured\" like the Taliban. \"They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall,\" he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive. \"That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul,\" Anderson added.
