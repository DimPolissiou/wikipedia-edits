In 1963, Franklin was voted 10th place for the [[Laurel Awards]] Top New Female Personality. She was 14 when she made ''[[The Third Secret (film)|The Third Secret]]'' (1964), in which she played a troubled young daughter. When she was interviewed about the film in 1979, she said that \"she and [[Stephen Boyd]] had become friends and the warmth on screen was genuine.\"  In 1966 she had a lead role in the BBC TV series ''[[Quick Before They Catch Us]]''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Later career in film and television==\n\nFranklin received favourable notices for her portrayal of an unusually worldly teenager in the suspense film ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'' (1965) starring [[Bette Davis]].  She also received an [[Emmy]] nomination for her supporting role in the TV movie ''[[Eagle in a Cage]]'' (also 1965) in which she again acted opposite [[Trevor Howard]]. She acted with [[Dirk Bogarde]], who played her father in ''[[Our Mother's House]]'' (1967), a film that was nominated for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. Not long afterwards, Franklin played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Rita Moreno]] in ''[[The Night of the Following Day]]'' (1969) as the kidnap victim in the crime thriller. This was her first \"adult\" role, with one scene showing her topless. She appeared with [[Michele Dotrice]] in the horror thriller ''[[And Soon the Darkness]]'' (1970), a film that was remade in 2010.\n\nFor her role as Sandy in ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1969), Franklin won the [[National Board of Review]] award for Best Supporting Actress. In the same year, she starred in the [[John Huston]] movie ''[[Sinful Davey]]'' with a young [[John Hurt]], which was not successful and failed to boost her career.\n\nAs an adult, Franklin became somewhat typecast in horror films after her performances in the popular occult thrillers ''[[Necromancy_(film)|Necromancy]]'' (1972)<ref>{{cite web|title=NECROMANCY (1972)|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54661|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|website=AFI.com|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> and ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973)<ref>{{cite web|title=THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (1973)|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55076|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|website=AFI.com|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> opposite [[Roddy McDowall]]. This was followed with the television horror movie ''[[Satan's School for Girls (1973 film)|Satan's School for Girls]]'' (1973).  Her last film role was in ''[[The Food of the Gods (film)|The Food of the Gods]]'' (1976), although she made television appearances until 1981, including an episode of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', in which she became physically ill playing a rape victim.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nFranklin made other television appearances including ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island (1977 TV series)|Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'',  ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'', and ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]''  She gave a memorable performance as the title character in \"Jenny Wilde is Drowning,\" an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'', starring [[Tony Franciosa]]. Her character was an aspiring actress trying to succeed in Hollywood.<ref>Although a 1983 production of ''Macbeth'' at the Garden Grove Shakespearean Festival in California mentioned that a \"Pamela Franklin\" played Lady Macbeth, the actress was not the same Pamela Franklin from film and television. See cast for Grove Theater: A Little Shakespeare--Long Beach Style, ''[[Orange Coast Magazine]]'', November 1983, pp. 146-147</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nFranklin met British actor [[Harvey Jason]], 10 years her senior, on the set of ''[[Necromancy (film)|Necromancy]]''.  Although the film was not released until 1972, the couple married in 1970<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V62V-QT6 California Marriage Index]</ref> and settled near [[Hollywood]] and had two sons. Her husband, along with one of their sons, Louis, co-owns the bookstore [http://www.mysterypierbooks.com/ Mystery Pier Books, Inc] in West Hollywood.\n\nOn the commentary track for the 2014 Region A Blu-ray release of ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' released by [[Scream Factory]], Franklin admits she was pregnant with her second child whilst filming ''[[The Food of the Gods (film)|Food of the Gods]]'' and she was ready for a change of career although she enjoyed making the film and living on the island location.

She also received an [[Emmy]] nomination for her supporting role in the TV movie ''[[Eagle in a Cage]]'' (also 1965) in which she again acted opposite [[Trevor Howard]]. She acted with [[Dirk Bogarde]], who played her father in ''[[Our Mother's House]]'' (1967), a film that was nominated for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

In the same year, she starred in the [[John Huston]] movie ''[[Sinful Davey]]''(also 1969) with a young [[John Hurt]], which was not successful and failed to boost her career.\n\nAs an adult, Franklin became somewhat typecast in horror films after her performances in the popular occult thrillers ''[[Necromancy_(film)|Necromancy]]'' (1972)<ref>{{cite web|title=NECROMANCY (1972)|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54661|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|website=AFI.com|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> and ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973)<ref>{{cite web|title=THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (1973)|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55076|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|website=AFI.com|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> opposite [[Roddy McDowall]].

Her last film role was in ''[[The Food of the Gods (film)|The Food of the Gods]]'' (1976), although she made television appearances until 1981, including an episode of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', in which she became physically ill playing a rape victim.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nFranklin made other television appearances including ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island (1977 TV series)|Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'',  ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'', and ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]''  She gave a memorable performance as the title character in \"Jenny Wilde is Drowning,\" an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'', starring [[Tony Franciosa]]. Her character was an aspiring actress trying to succeed in Hollywood.<ref>Although a 1983 production of ''Macbeth'' at the Garden Grove Shakespearean Festival in California mentioned that a \"Pamela Franklin\" played Lady Macbeth, the actress was not the same Pamela Franklin from film and television. See cast for Grove Theater: A Little Shakespeare--Long Beach Style, ''[[Orange Coast Magazine]]'', November 1983, pp. 146-147</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nFranklin met British actor [[Harvey Jason]], 10 years her senior, on the set of ''[[Necromancy (film)|Necromancy]]''.  Although the film was not released until 1972, the couple married in 1970<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V62V-QT6 California Marriage Index]</ref> and settled near [[Hollywood]] and had two sons.
