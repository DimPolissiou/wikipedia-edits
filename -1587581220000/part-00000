Bloom also, according to Griffin, charged exorbitant legal fees, which Griffin estimated amounted to $40,000 for two days' representation, including by defense attorney [[Dmitry Gorin]], whom Bloom had allegedly hired without Griffin's consent. In response to Griffin's comments, Bloom claimed she \"had no idea there was a problem\" and released a statement that criticized Griffin for speaking extemporaneously at the press conference but nevertheless wished her well.<ref name=\"daily-beast-fame-whore\"/><ref name=\"bloom-tweet-922186437620928512\">{{Cite tweet |user = LisaBloom |author-link = Lisa Bloom |number=922186437620928512|date=22 October 2017 |title=My statement re Kathy Griffin.}}</ref>\n\nIn response to Griffin, [[Tamara Holder]], a former Bloom client, and [[Jehmu Greene]], who had considered hiring Bloom, came forward with their own criticisms. Bloom, whom Holder had retained after accusing [[Fox News#Online|Fox News Latino]] Vice President Francisco Cortes of sexual assault, proposed an initial retainer agreement that awarded Bloom 40% of any settlement, as well as a $10,000 retainer fee and reimbursement for any relevant hotel and travel expenses. Although Holder ultimately negotiated a more favorable contract, she criticized Bloom for thousands of dollars in extraneous expenses and for allegedly pushing Holder to accept a gag order in her settlement with Fox News. For her part, Greene called Bloom \"deceptive\" for presenting her with a contract for media representation after a meeting focused primarily on legal services.

Mr. Chitwood denied the allegations, claiming they were a tactic to prevent the enforcement of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement and force a settlement.\n\nMr. Chitwood refused to settle, and on August 31, 2017, after a five-week [[civil trial]] before the Honorable Joan Lewis in the Superior Court of San Diego, a twelve-person jury found Mr. Chitwood was not liable for the single claim Bloom had brought against him.
