In a famous episode, shortly after its conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead.

With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.\n\n====Arrest at Cannanore, 1509====\nAfonso arrived at [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he opened before the viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida, the sealed letter which he had received from the King, and which named as governor to succeed Almeida.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/><ref>Afonso, like many others since then, took office as governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the King promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented.</ref><ref>In the first months of 1508, the son of D.

Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy.

However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J.

He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route....

It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted.

To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.\n\n===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===\nIn December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies.

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|upright|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]\nKing Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Br\u00e1s de Albuquerque]] (1500\u20131580),<ref>Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Universalgeschichte''. [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], [[Stuttgart]]</ref> whom he renamed \"Afonso\" in memory of the father.\n\nAfonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship, covering topics from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''<ref>Forbes, Jack D. (1993) ''Africans and Native Americans'' \"University of Illinois Press\". 344 pages. {{ISBN|0-252-06321-X}}</ref>- a clear reference to [[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Caesar's Commentaries]]- which he reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Afonso was described as \"a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.\"<ref>Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es]] (Canto X, strophes 40\u201349). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Cam\u00f5es was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.\n\nA [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nNumerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.\n\n===Global legacy===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]\nThe fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times. In the 2nd century AD, the [[Malay Peninsula]] was known by the Greek philosopher [[Ptolemy]], who labeled it 'Aurea Chersonesus\"; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance. Even Indian traders referred to the East Pacific region as \"Land of Gold\" and made regular visits to Malaya in search of the precious metal, tin and sweet scented jungle woods.<ref>''Lonely Planet Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei'' by Simon Richmond, Lonely Planet (2010), p. 30</ref> But neither Ptolemy, nor Rome, nor Alexander was able to see the fabled regions of the East Pacific.

Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy.

During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief \"[[Aguazil]]\" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.\n[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]\nIn Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220\u2013221}}</ref> The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or \"esfera\"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''\" (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)\n[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]\nIn February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Ara\u00fajo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.\n\n===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===\nIn December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.\n\nIn early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]].

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.<ref name=\"intlhistory.blogspot.com.au\">\" target=\"_blank\"http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html</ref> At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}</ref> There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill.

At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\">Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s de (1774).

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|upright|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]\nKing Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Br\u00e1s de Albuquerque]] (1500\u20131580),<ref>Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Universalgeschichte''. [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], [[Stuttgart]]</ref> whom he renamed \"Afonso\" in memory of the father.\n\nAfonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship, covering topics from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''<ref>Forbes, Jack D. (1993) ''Africans and Native Americans'' \"University of Illinois Press\". 344 pages. {{ISBN|0-252-06321-X}}</ref>- a clear reference to [[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Caesar's Commentaries]]- which he reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Afonso was described as \"a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.\"<ref>Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es]] (Canto X, strophes 40\u201349). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Cam\u00f5es was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.\n\nA [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nNumerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.\n\n===Global legacy===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]\nThe fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times. In the 2nd century AD, the [[Malay Peninsula]] was known by the Greek philosopher [[Ptolemy]], who labeled it 'Aurea Chersonesus\"; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance.

The Comoro Islands lie in the [[Mozambique Channel]] between [[Madagascar]] and East Africa. There are four main islands \u2013 [[Grande Comore]], [[Anjouan]], [[Moh\u00e9li]], and [[Mayotte]] \u2013 and several smaller ones. The islands are politically divided between two countries; the [[Comoros|Union of the Comoros]] is an independent nation that includes three of the main islands, while Mayotte is a region of [[France]].\n\nThese volcanic islands are rich in wildlife with endemic species including four endangered bird species living on [[Mount Karthala]], the large active volcano on [[Grande Comore]]. The islands have a wet tropical climate with a rainy season between October and April.<ref>\n{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at0105|name=Comoros forests}}</ref>\n\n==Flora==\nBoth the flora and the fauna are similar to Madagascar, although there are more than 500 species of plants endemic to the Comoros. The two larger islands [[Grand Comoro]] and [[Anjouan]] have higher peaks and a variety of lowland and mountain forest, with [[mangroves]] along the coasts.\n\n==Fauna==\nThere are more birds, mammals, and reptiles than one would expect to find on an [[Indian Ocean]] island, including [[lemurs]], as in nearby Madagascar. Endemic species include 21 species of birds, 9 species of reptiles, and two species of fruit bats (''[[Pteropus livingstonii]]'' and ''[[Rousettus obliviosus]]''). Other mammals include the [[mongoose lemur]] ''(Eulemur mongoz)'' and a sub-species of the [[Seychelles fruit bat]] ''(Pteropus seychellensis comorensis)''.\n\n==Threats and conservation==\nThe population of the Comoros is currently over 700,000 and as it increases more and more forest is being cleared for farming, with volcanic eruptions and cyclones damaging the forest further, and threatening the fruit bat populations in particular.\n\nThe largest unspoilt forest remaining is located on the higher mountain slopes including [[Mount Karthala]], which is unprotected as is the forest on [[Ntingui]] on Anjouan. Protected areas include [[Mlima Combani and Mlima Mtsap\u00e9r\u00e9 Important Bird Area|Mount Combani]] and the [[Saziley National Park]] on [[Mayotte]], while the only protected area in Comoros proper is the marine park on [[Moheli]].\n\n==Visiting the ecoregion==\nGrande Comore, dominated by Mount Karthala, which can be climbed in one or two days, is the largest and most developed island and location of the international airport. Anjouan is reached by boat from Grande Comore, the two features here are Mount Ntingui and [[Lake Dzialandz\u00e9]], both [[Ramsar site|Ramsar]] List sites. Saziley Point is visited from the village of [[Dapani]] on Mayotte, there is a birding trail through the forest.

His songs are written mostly in Chinese, with a few in English.  The lyrics often reflect traditional Chinese thought, combined with a contemporary mentality.\n\nIn 1978, Hou Dejian wrote a song entitled \"[[Descendants of the Dragon (song)|Descendants of the Dragon]]\", with which he gained significant popularity. He left Taiwan for mainland China in 1983, despite the ban for the visit from the [[Republic of China]] government on Taiwan.  He then witnessed and became a part of the hunger strike with three others in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] pro-democracy movement in [[Beijing]]. They have been called 'Four men of honour' (\u56db\u541b\u5b50).\n\n==June 2 hunger strike declaration==\n\nOn June 2 [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Zhou Duo]], and [[Gao Xin]] joined Hou Dejian in Tiananmen Square to announce their [[hunger strike]] in support of the student movement.<ref>Zhang Liang, ''The Tiananmen Papers''. eds Perry Link and Andrew J.

Please give us enough time to organize an evacuation.\u201d<ref>Zhang, p. 380</ref> After the government accepted Hou's request, Hou and Zhou Duo rushed to the monument to announce that the command post had agreed to the evacuation of the square.<ref>Zhang, p. 381</ref> The crowd of students was initially reluctant to leave the square. However, with the help of [[Feng Congde]], Hou Dejian and the student leaders were able to usher the students away.<ref>Cheng, p. 265</ref>\n\n==Life as a dissident==\nAfter the 1989 events at Tiananmen, Hou Dejian disappeared from the public eye to avoid the crackdown on so called \u201ccounterrevolutionaries\u201d who had participated in the protest.

The airline was mainly competing with British Midland and Aer Lingus services from Dublin to London Heathrow and Ryanair services from Dublin to London Stansted. However, Cityjet held a monopoly on services to London City until Aer Lingus launches services from Dublin to London City as well in September 1999.<ref name=\"seanbarrett\">{{cite book |last1=Barrett |first1=Sean |title=Deregulation and the Airline Business in Europe |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1995, Virgin Cityjet debuted with flights between Dublin and Brussels, competing with Sabena and Aer Lingus initially.<ref name=\"seanbarrett\"/>\n\nIn 1996, the airline terminated its franchise agreement with Virgin Atlantic on short notice and decided to continue operations using its own CityJet name from the end of July that year. By then, the airline flew scheduled flights from Dublin to London City, Brussels and Malaga. The decision to discontinue the Virgin Atlantic franchise came as Virgin itself entered the European short-haul market with budget carrier [[Virgin Express]] and CityJet feared customers could confuse the low-cost carrier with its own full-service operation.<ref name=\"1997virgincityjet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/cityjet-flies-solo-as-virgin-brand-goes-1.64592|title=CityJet flies solo as Virgin brand goes|date=5 July 1996|website=irishtimes.com|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Air France era===\nIn 1999, Cityjet was at the verge of bankruptcy. [[Air Foyle]] acquired half of the shares in the airline in return of assuming the carriers debts. Air France took another 25 percent while investing \u00a32 million. Under the new structure, Cityjet retained its own scheduled services while also becoming Air France' principal European subcontract airline.

The airline was mainly competing with British Midland and Aer Lingus services from Dublin to London Heathrow and Ryanair services from Dublin to London Stansted. However, Cityjet held a monopoly on services to London City until Aer Lingus launches services from Dublin to London City as well in September 1999.<ref name=\"seanbarrett\">{{cite book |last1=Barrett |first1=Sean |title=Deregulation and the Airline Business in Europe |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1995, Virgin Cityjet debuted with flights between Dublin and Brussels, competing with Sabena and Aer Lingus initially.<ref name=\"seanbarrett\"/>\n\nIn 1996, the airline terminated its franchise agreement with Virgin Atlantic on short notice and decided to continue operations using its own CityJet name from the end of July that year. By then, the airline flew scheduled flights from Dublin to London City, Brussels and Malaga.

The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing \"Sk8er Boi\"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".{{r|goingthedistance}}\n\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}\n\n[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}\n\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}\n\nBoth ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}\n\n==Fashion==\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}\n\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"{{r|inked2010}}\n\nLavigne released her first fragrance, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], created by [[Procter & Gamble]] Prestige Products.

The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing \"Sk8er Boi\"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".{{r|goingthedistance}}\n\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}\n\n[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}\n\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}\n\nBoth ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}\n\n==Fashion==\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}\n\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"{{r|inked2010}}\n\nLavigne released her first fragrance, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], created by [[Procter & Gamble]] Prestige Products.

They will replace all [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] cars on the [[Staten Island Railway]] and all [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] subway cars. The order is split into three parts: '''R211A''' and '''R211T''' cars for the subway and '''R211S''' cars for the SIR. The R211Ts will employ [[Gangway_connection#Open_gangways_in_urban_transit|open gangways]] between cars, a feature not present on current rolling stock. The base order consists of 535 cars, with options for up to 1,077 additional cars.\n\nPlanning for the R211 order started in 2011. The design process started in 2012, at which time the order was supposed to consist of {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} cars. The cars' lengths were changed to {{convert|sing=off|60|ft|m}} by 2015, and the first [[request for proposals]] was solicited in July 2016. After several changes to the proposal, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) awarded a contract to Kawasaki in January 2018. The cars are expected to be delivered between 2020 and 2023.

Around 1450, [[Rajus|Kakarlapudi Appala Raju Payakarao]] took over the rule of region under the [[Nawabs of Arcot|Nawab of Arcot]], with Anakapalle as his fortified headquarters. The saga of Anakapalle starts with a historian named \"Tallapragada\" place and found that Anakapalle. This was proved from the historical evidences found on Bojjana Konda. [[Satavahana]]s, [[Vishnukundina]], Gajapathi's, [[Vijayanagara]] Samrats, [[Golkonda]] Samanta Rajulu ruled the area.\n\nIts alias names are Aniankapalli, Anekaphalle, Vijaypuri, Veniapalii, Kanakapuri, Bellampatnam,  Anakapally and Anakapalli. It is located by the side of a holy [[Sarada River]]. During the Independence struggle of India, many prominent leaders like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] visited Anakapalle. It is around 34&nbsp;km in distance from [[Visakhapatnam]].\n\n=== Buddhist area ===\nOne of the most significant [[Buddhist]] sites in [[Andhra Pradesh]], Sankaram is located some 3.5&nbsp;km away from Anakapalle and 41&nbsp;km away from [[Visakhapatnam]] on the Sabbavaram by-pass road. The name Sankaram derives from the term Sangharama. Sankaram is famous for the whole lot of votive stupas, rock-cut caves, brick-built structural edifices, early historic pottery and [[Satavahana]] coins that date back to the 1st century AD. The main stupa here was initially carved out of rock and then covered with bricks.\nwhere you can see a number of images of the [[Buddha]] carved on the rock face of the caves. At Lingalametta, there are hundreds of rock cut [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] [[stupas]] in rows, spread all over the hill.

Around 1450, [[Rajus|Kakarlapudi Appala Raju Payakarao]] took over the rule of region under the [[Nawabs of Arcot|Nawab of Arcot]], with Anakapalle as his fortified headquarters. The saga of Anakapalle starts with a historian named \"Tallapragada\" place and found that Anakapalle. This was proved from the historical evidences found on Bojjana Konda. [[Satavahana]]s, [[Vishnukundina]], Gajapathi's, [[Vijayanagara]] Samrats, [[Golkonda]] Samanta Rajulu ruled the area.\n\nIts alias names are Aniankapalli, Anekaphalle, Vijaypuri, Veniapalii, Kanakapuri, Bellampatnam,  Anakapally and Anakapalli. It is located by the side of a holy [[Sarada River]]. During the Independence struggle of India, many prominent leaders like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] visited Anakapalle. It is around 34&nbsp;km in distance from [[Visakhapatnam]].\n\n=== Buddhist area ===\nOne of the most significant [[Buddhist]] sites in [[Andhra Pradesh]], Sankaram is located some 3.5&nbsp;km away from Anakapalle and 41&nbsp;km away from [[Visakhapatnam]] on the Sabbavaram by-pass road. The name Sankaram derives from the term Sangharama. Sankaram is famous for the whole lot of votive stupas, rock-cut caves, brick-built structural edifices, early historic pottery and [[Satavahana]] coins that date back to the 1st century AD. The main stupa here was initially carved out of rock and then covered with bricks.\nwhere you can see a number of images of the [[Buddha]] carved on the rock face of the caves. At Lingalametta, there are hundreds of rock cut [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] [[stupas]] in rows, spread all over the hill. Among other [[Buddhist]] attractions here are [[relic]] casket, three chiatya halls, votive platforms, stupas and Vajrayana sculptures.
