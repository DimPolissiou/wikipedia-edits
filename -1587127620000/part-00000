The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|5|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/15|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 15|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts).

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.
