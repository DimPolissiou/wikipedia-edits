Retrieved February 29, 2016</ref> with origins in the fifth century AD or possibly earlier. It is based in the region of the historical [[Catalan counties|Catalan]] County of Urgell, though it has different borders.  The seat and [[Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell|Cathedral]] of the bishop are situated in [[la Seu d'Urgell]] town. The state of Andorra is a part of this diocese.\n\nAmong its most notable events are [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Bishop Felix's]] adoptionist revolt, the coup of Bishop Esclua and the overthrowing of the bishop by members of aristocratic families (namely Salla i Ermengol del Conflent, Eribau i Folcs dels Cardona, Guillem Guifr\u00e9 de Cerdanya and Ot de Pallars) between the years 981 and 1122.\n\nAlso important is the diocese's patronage of Andorra, with the bishop holding the role of ''ex officio'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of Andorra jointly with the [[President of France]] (and formerly, the King of France). Andorra was ceded to the [[Bishop of Urgell]] by the [[Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell|Count Ermengol VI of Urgell]] in 1133.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bueno Salinas\n |first=Santiago |last2=P\u00e9rez-Madrid |first2=Francisca |title=Religion and the Secular State in Andorra |url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Andorra.2.pdf |publisher=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|pages=58|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nUp to 1802, the ecclesiastical border corresponded with the royal one established under the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659. As such the 33 towns of the northern [[Cerdanya]] (now in France) came under the diocese's control.\n\n==Description of the diocesan territory==\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] controls the [[Archdiocese of Tarragona|metropolitan church]] of [[Tarragona]], with its [[Episcopal see|see]] or capital of the Seu d\u2019Urgell (Urgell See). It contains 7630&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 200,761 according to the 2000 [[census]] and is the largest bishopric of the eight that have a see in Catalonia. In contrast, it is the most sparsely populated. The diocese borders the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic|Vic]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Solsona|Solsona]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida|Lleida]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Barbastro-Monz\u00f3n|Barbastro-Monz\u00f3n]], [[Toulouse]], [[Pamiers]] and [[Perpignan]]. It has been deeply linked for many years to the regions that constituted the counties of [[Urgell]], [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] and [[Cerdanya]] during the [[Middle Ages]], with which it identifies and forms a historical and geographic unit maintained up to the present day. The diocese totally or partially occupies the [[Ripoll\u00e8s]], [[Cerdanya]], [[Alt Urgell]], [[Segarra]], Urgell, [[Pla d'Urgell]], [[Noguera (comarca)|Noguera]], [[Pallars Juss\u00e0]], [[Pallars Sobir\u00e0]], [[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a]] and the [[Vall d'Aran]] regions.\n\nThe bishopric\u2019s jurisdiction extends to 408 parishes, although today some have a very reduced population. Almost all of the parishes come from distant times, as the very [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] saints of their churches. The most common are [[Saint Mary]] (in 90 parochial churches, as well as the [[cathedral]]), [[Saint Peter]] (35), [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin]] (29), [[Perpetua and Felicity|Saint Saturninus]] (24), [[Saint Steven]] (23), [[Saint Michael]] (19), [[Saint Andrew]] (17), [[Julian of Toledo|Saint Julian]] (12), [[Saint Eulalia of Barcelona|Saint Eulalia]] (11), [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]] and [[Felix of Girona|Saint Felix]] (10). Many churches of the [[Diocese|bishopric]], parochial or not, conserve elements of great architectural interest, and thirty-six of them are considered cultural goods of [[national interest]] in [[Spain]].\n\nAmongst all Catalan bishoprics, the Diocese of Urgell has been that which has experienced the most border-related changes throughout its existence, mainly for political reasons: the loss of [[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a|Ribagor\u00e7a]] (9th century), to the benefit of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of Spain|Diocese of Roda]], and the cession of 144 parishes of the [[Bergued\u00e0]], the [[Solson\u00e8s]] and a part of the Segarra, to the benefit of the new diocese of Solsona (1593-1623); later, it was necessary to adapt the territory to the borders between states, and thus in 1803, the 24 parishes of [[French Cerdagne]], which had been ceded to France from the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, also passed ecclesiastically to that country; and in 1804, the 28 from the [[Aran Valley]], a territory circumscribed by [[France]] yet united fully to the Catalan-Aragonese territories at least since the 12th century, were annexed to the diocese of Urgell, coming from the eliminated [[Gascony|Gascon]] diocese of [[Sant Bertran de Comenge]]. In 1874 the sixty-odd towns that formed the erstwhile exempt jurisdictions of [[Gerri]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Montod\u00f3-Bonrep\u00f2s]], the order of [[Saint John of Jerusalem]] and [[Mei\u00e0]] were annexed to the diocese. Finally, in 1956, the diocese gained the seven parishes of the [[Artesa de Segre]] enclave and gave up the 19 of the [[Franja de Ponent]] [Western Strip] to [[Lleida]] and [[Barbastre]], grouped into three enclaves.\n\n==Origin of the Urgell diocese==\n[[File:Katalanischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|[[Frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles]], now conserved at [[MNAC Barcelona]].]]\nThe diocese, without excluding the possibility of a more remote origin, was already constituted at the beginning of the 6th century. The first known bishop, [[Justus of Urgell|Saint Justus]], figures among the participants of the councils of [[Councils of Toledo|Toledo]] (531), [[Lleida]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (546). His successors also took part regularly in the Toledo councils celebrated throughout the 7th century. The Episcopal succession, despite the uncertainty of names and chronology, seems to not be interrupted by the [[Saracen]] invasion of 714.\n\n[[Monasticism]] must have been introduced into the diocese during the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period. The monasteries of [[Tav\u00e8rnoles]], [[Gerri]], [[Codinet]], and [[Tresponts]] are probably anterior to the Saracen invasion. These foundations and the later ones--[[la Vedella]], [[Elins]], [[Bag\u00e0]], [[la Portella]], [[les Maleses]], [[Villanega]], [[Oveix]], [[Bellera]], [[el Burgal]], [[Lavaix]], [[Ala\u00f3]], [[Escales]], [[Ovarra]], [[Taverna]], [[Gualter]], etc.\u2014often adopted the Benedictine observance from the 9th century on, following the example of the majority of the coenobitic monasteries then extant in the [[Marca Hispanica]]. This became the norm for monastic life in the following century. These monasteries, alongside the parochial and canonical organization (the Urgell Diocese, [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Organy\u00e0]], [[Ponts, Lleida|Ponts]], [[\u00c0ger|Ager]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Tremp]]) would greatly influence the Christianization of the country and its human, cultural and economic development.\n\nThe [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] monasteries derived into colleges as a result of their [[secularization]] (1592), and due to their corruption, the 1851 concord eliminated them, along with the other preexisting ones ([[Castellb\u00f2]], [[Guissona]], [[Balaguer]]). Mur and \u00c0ger were without a doubt the most famous Catalan canonical colleges, exempt from episcopal jurisdiction\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\n[[File:SantPere SeuUrgell MNAC-015867 0002.jpg|thumb|[[Apse from La Seu d'Urgell]].]]\nOn the first decade of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], Berber troops set up garrisons on the northernmost hilly regions and towns. [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] settled down in [[Cerdanya]], killed the bishop of Urgell, and rebelled against central Cordovan rule in 730. The Berber lord was killed in 731, and the region subdued by [[Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi]].\n\nDuring the [[Episcopal polity|episcopacy]] of the Bishop [[Felix (Bishop of Urgell)|Felix]] (781\u2013799), who was accused of [[adoptionism]] by the [[Carolingian]] theologians and for this motive deposed and confined to [[Lyon]], the city of Urgell and its church were completely destroyed by the Arabs around 793. With the founding of the [[Marca Hispanica]], the diocese, like the others recently restored, became part of the [[ecclesiastical province of Narbonne]] until the recreation of the [[metropolitan see of Tarragona]] in 1091. The [[Franks|Frankish]] kings intervened effectively in the country\u2019s reconstruction, promoting the [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] laying the foundations of its government. The territory now being free, mainly, from the [[Moors]]' power, with the help of the first [[Catalan Counts]], they promoted the construction of a new cathedral, completed in the second part of the 9th century, to which were assigned 289 towns or villages\u2014all the northwestern area of the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nAt the same time, the Urgell church, ruled for more than two centuries (914-1122) by members of the Counts' families, fully entered the ring of the feudal system, which allowed it to shape for itself an extensive seigniorial patrimony, which among other cities and territories included the city of Urgell, the valleys of [[Andorra]], the [[Vall de la Llosa]], the [[Vall d\u2019Arques]] and the [[Ribera Salada]], the villages of [[Sana\u00fcja]], [[Guissona]], and from 1257 onwards, [[Tremp]]. This, however, forced it into a certain dependence on the superior power of the Counts. Also, the [[Gregorian Reform]], introduced to the County of Urgell during the last years of the 11th century, preceded by the change of the [[Visigothic rite]] for the [[Roman rite]], reduced those interventions of the [[laymen]] in ecclesiastical affairs and achieved the complete freedom of the Church in the spiritual and temporal domains.

It is based in the region of the historical [[Catalan counties|Catalan]] County of Urgell, though it has different borders.  The seat and [[Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell|Cathedral]] of the bishop are situated in [[la Seu d'Urgell]] town. The state of Andorra is a part of this diocese.\n\nAmong its most notable events are [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Bishop Felix's]] adoptionist revolt, the coup of Bishop Esclua and the overthrowing of the bishop by members of aristocratic families (namely Salla i Ermengol del Conflent, Eribau i Folcs dels Cardona, Guillem Guifr\u00e9 de Cerdanya and Ot de Pallars) between the years 981 and 1122.\n\nAlso important is the diocese's patronage of Andorra, with the bishop holding the role of ''ex officio'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of Andorra jointly with the [[President of France]] (and formerly, the King of France). Andorra was ceded to the [[Bishop of Urgell]] by the [[Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell|Count Ermengol VI of Urgell]] in 1133.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bueno Salinas\n |first=Santiago |last2=P\u00e9rez-Madrid |first2=Francisca |title=Religion and the Secular State in Andorra |url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Andorra.2.pdf |publisher=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|pages=58|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nUp to 1802, the ecclesiastical border corresponded with the royal one established under the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659. As such the 33 towns of the northern [[Cerdanya]] (now in France) came under the diocese's control.\n\n==Description of the diocesan territory==\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] controls the [[Archdiocese of Tarragona|metropolitan church]] of [[Tarragona]], with its [[Episcopal see|see]] or capital of the Seu d\u2019Urgell (Urgell See). It contains 7630&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 200,761 according to the 2000 [[census]] and is the largest bishopric of the eight that have a see in Catalonia. In contrast, it is the most sparsely populated. The diocese borders the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic|Vic]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Solsona|Solsona]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida|Lleida]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Barbastro-Monz\u00f3n|Barbastro-Monz\u00f3n]], [[Toulouse]], [[Pamiers]] and [[Perpignan]]. It has been deeply linked for many years to the regions that constituted the counties of [[Urgell]], [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] and [[Cerdanya]] during the [[Middle Ages]], with which it identifies and forms a historical and geographic unit maintained up to the present day. The diocese totally or partially occupies the [[Ripoll\u00e8s]], [[Cerdanya]], [[Alt Urgell]], [[Segarra]], Urgell, [[Pla d'Urgell]], [[Noguera (comarca)|Noguera]], [[Pallars Juss\u00e0]], [[Pallars Sobir\u00e0]], [[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a]] and the [[Vall d'Aran]] regions.\n\nThe bishopric\u2019s jurisdiction extends to 408 parishes, although today some have a very reduced population. Almost all of the parishes come from distant times, as the very [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] saints of their churches. The most common are [[Saint Mary]] (in 90 parochial churches, as well as the [[cathedral]]), [[Saint Peter]] (35), [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin]] (29), [[Perpetua and Felicity|Saint Saturninus]] (24), [[Saint Steven]] (23), [[Saint Michael]] (19), [[Saint Andrew]] (17), [[Julian of Toledo|Saint Julian]] (12), [[Saint Eulalia of Barcelona|Saint Eulalia]] (11), [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]] and [[Felix of Girona|Saint Felix]] (10). Many churches of the [[Diocese|bishopric]], parochial or not, conserve elements of great architectural interest, and thirty-six of them are considered cultural goods of [[national interest]] in [[Spain]].\n\nAmongst all Catalan bishoprics, the Diocese of Urgell has been that which has experienced the most border-related changes throughout its existence, mainly for political reasons: the loss of [[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a|Ribagor\u00e7a]] (9th century), to the benefit of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of Spain|Diocese of Roda]], and the cession of 144 parishes of the [[Bergued\u00e0]], the [[Solson\u00e8s]] and a part of the Segarra, to the benefit of the new diocese of Solsona (1593-1623); later, it was necessary to adapt the territory to the borders between states, and thus in 1803, the 24 parishes of [[French Cerdagne]], which had been ceded to France from the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, also passed ecclesiastically to that country; and in 1804, the 28 from the [[Aran Valley]], a territory circumscribed by [[France]] yet united fully to the Catalan-Aragonese territories at least since the 12th century, were annexed to the diocese of Urgell, coming from the eliminated [[Gascony|Gascon]] diocese of [[Sant Bertran de Comenge]]. In 1874 the sixty-odd towns that formed the erstwhile exempt jurisdictions of [[Gerri]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Montod\u00f3-Bonrep\u00f2s]], the order of [[Saint John of Jerusalem]] and [[Mei\u00e0]] were annexed to the diocese. Finally, in 1956, the diocese gained the seven parishes of the [[Artesa de Segre]] enclave and gave up the 19 of the [[Franja de Ponent]] [Western Strip] to [[Lleida]] and [[Barbastre]], grouped into three enclaves.\n\n==Origin of the Urgell diocese==\n[[File:Katalanischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|[[Frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles]], now conserved at [[MNAC Barcelona]].]]\nThe diocese, without excluding the possibility of a more remote origin, was already constituted at the beginning of the 6th century. The first known bishop, [[Justus of Urgell|Saint Justus]], figures among the participants of the councils of [[Councils of Toledo|Toledo]] (531), [[Lleida]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (546). His successors also took part regularly in the Toledo councils celebrated throughout the 7th century. The Episcopal succession, despite the uncertainty of names and chronology, seems to not be interrupted by the [[Saracen]] invasion of 714.\n\n[[Monasticism]] must have been introduced into the diocese during the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period. The monasteries of [[Tav\u00e8rnoles]], [[Gerri]], [[Codinet]], and [[Tresponts]] are probably anterior to the Saracen invasion. These foundations and the later ones--[[la Vedella]], [[Elins]], [[Bag\u00e0]], [[la Portella]], [[les Maleses]], [[Villanega]], [[Oveix]], [[Bellera]], [[el Burgal]], [[Lavaix]], [[Ala\u00f3]], [[Escales]], [[Ovarra]], [[Taverna]], [[Gualter]], etc.\u2014often adopted the Benedictine observance from the 9th century on, following the example of the majority of the coenobitic monasteries then extant in the [[Marca Hispanica]]. This became the norm for monastic life in the following century. These monasteries, alongside the parochial and canonical organization (the Urgell Diocese, [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Organy\u00e0]], [[Ponts, Lleida|Ponts]], [[\u00c0ger|Ager]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Tremp]]) would greatly influence the Christianization of the country and its human, cultural and economic development.\n\nThe [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] monasteries derived into colleges as a result of their [[secularization]] (1592), and due to their corruption, the 1851 concord eliminated them, along with the other preexisting ones ([[Castellb\u00f2]], [[Guissona]], [[Balaguer]]). Mur and \u00c0ger were without a doubt the most famous Catalan canonical colleges, exempt from episcopal jurisdiction\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\n[[File:SantPere SeuUrgell MNAC-015867 0002.jpg|thumb|[[Apse from La Seu d'Urgell]].]]\nOn the first decade of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], Berber troops set up garrisons on the northernmost hilly regions and towns. [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] settled down in [[Cerdanya]], killed the bishop of Urgell, and rebelled against central Cordovan rule in 730. The Berber lord was killed in 731, and the region subdued by [[Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi]].\n\nDuring the [[Episcopal polity|episcopacy]] of the Bishop [[Felix (Bishop of Urgell)|Felix]] (781\u2013799), who was accused of [[adoptionism]] by the [[Carolingian]] theologians and for this motive deposed and confined to [[Lyon]], the city of Urgell and its church were completely destroyed by the Arabs around 793. With the founding of the [[Marca Hispanica]], the diocese, like the others recently restored, became part of the [[ecclesiastical province of Narbonne]] until the recreation of the [[metropolitan see of Tarragona]] in 1091. The [[Franks|Frankish]] kings intervened effectively in the country\u2019s reconstruction, promoting the [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] laying the foundations of its government. The territory now being free, mainly, from the [[Moors]]' power, with the help of the first [[Catalan Counts]], they promoted the construction of a new cathedral, completed in the second part of the 9th century, to which were assigned 289 towns or villages\u2014all the northwestern area of the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nAt the same time, the Urgell church, ruled for more than two centuries (914-1122) by members of the Counts' families, fully entered the ring of the feudal system, which allowed it to shape for itself an extensive seigniorial patrimony, which among other cities and territories included the city of Urgell, the valleys of [[Andorra]], the [[Vall de la Llosa]], the [[Vall d\u2019Arques]] and the [[Ribera Salada]], the villages of [[Sana\u00fcja]], [[Guissona]], and from 1257 onwards, [[Tremp]]. This, however, forced it into a certain dependence on the superior power of the Counts. Also, the [[Gregorian Reform]], introduced to the County of Urgell during the last years of the 11th century, preceded by the change of the [[Visigothic rite]] for the [[Roman rite]], reduced those interventions of the [[laymen]] in ecclesiastical affairs and achieved the complete freedom of the Church in the spiritual and temporal domains. Moreover, the maintenance of those possessions originated constant tension and fighting throughout the Middle Ages with the Viscounts of [[Castellb\u00f3]] and his heirs, the Counts of [[Foix]].\n\n==List of Bishops of Urgell==\n===Bishops to 1695===\n{{column list|colwidth=20em|\n*Justo bef. 527 \u2013 aft. 546\n*Epigan c. 550\n*Marcel I c.570\n*Simplici 589\u2013599\n*Gabila c. 604\n*Renari c. 633\n*Meurell 653\u2013665\n*Leuderic I 665\u2013683\n*[[Jacint, Bishop of Urgell|Jacint]] ? 672\u2013680 ?\n*Leuberic 683\u2013693\n*Urbici 693\u2013704\n*Marcel II 704\u2013721\n*Just II 721\u2013733\n*[[Nambaudus|Anambad]] ? 733\u2013731\n*[[Leuderic II, Bishop of Urgell|Leuderic II]] 732\u2013754\n*Esteve 754\u2013765\n*[[Dotila d'Urgell|Dotilla]] 765\u2013783\n*[[Felix of Urgel|F\u00e9lix]] 783\u2013792\n*[[Radulf, Bishop of Urgell|Radulf]] 792\u2013798\n*F\u00e9lix (second time) 798\u2013799\n*[[Leidrat de Li\u00f3]] 799\u2013806\n*[[Posedoni, Bishop of Urgell|Posedoni]] I 806\u2013819\n*[[Sisebut, Bishop of Urgell|Sisebut I]] 819\u2013823\n*[[Posedoni II, Bishop of Urgell|Posedoni II]] 823\u2013833\n*Sisebut 833\u2013840\n*[[Florenci, Bishop of Urgell|Florenci]] 840\u2013850\n*[[Beat d'Urgell|Beat]] 850\u2013857\n*Guisad I 857\u2013872\n*[[Golderic, Bishop of Urgell|Golderic]] 872\u2013885\n*Esclua 885\u2013892 \n*[[Ingobert, Bishop of Urgell|Ingobert]] 893\u2013900\n*[[Nantigis, Bishop of Urgell|Nantigis]] 900\u2013914\n*[[Trigilbert, Bishop of Urgell|Trigilbert]] 914\n*Radulf 914\u2013940\n*[[Guisad I, Bishop of Urgell]] 940\u2013981\n*[[Sal.la]] 981\u20131010\n*[[Saint Ermengol|Ermengol]] 1010\u20131035\n*[[Eribau, Bishop of Urgell]] 1035\u20131040\n*[[Guillem Guifredo]] 1040\u20131075\n*[[Bernat Guillermo]] 1075\u20131092\n*[[Folc II of Cardona]] 1092\u20131095\n*[[Guillem Arnau]] 1092\u20131095\n*[[Ot of Urgell|Ot]] 1095\u20131122\n*[[Pere Berenguer]] 1122\u20131141\n*[[Bernat San\u00e7]] 1141\u20131162\n*[[Bernat Roger]] 1162\u20131166\n*[[Arnau de Preixens]] 1166\u20131195\n*[[Bernat de Castell\u00f3]] 1195\u20131198\n*[[Bernat de Vilamur]] 1198\u20131203\n*[[Pere de Puigvert]] 1203\u20131230\n*[[Pon\u00e7 de Vilamur]] 1230\u20131257\n*[[Abril P\u00e9rez Pel\u00e1ez]] 1257\u20131269\n*[[Pere d'Urtx]] 1269\u20131293\n*[[Guillem de Montcada]] 1295\u20131308\n*[[Ramon Trebaylla]] 1308\u20131326\n*[[Arnau de Llord\u00e0|Arnau de Llordat]] 1326\u20131341\n*[[Pere de Narbona]] 1341\u20131348\n*[[Nicola Capocci|Niccol\u00f3 Capocci]] 1348\u20131351\n*[[Hugo Desbach, Bishop of Urgell|Hug Desbac]] 1351\u20131361\n*[[Guillem Arnau i Palau]] 1361\u20131364\n*[[Pedro Mart\u00ednez Luna]] 1364\u20131370\n*[[Berenguer d'Erill i de Pallars]] 1370\u20131387\n*[[Galcer\u00e0 de Vilanova]] 1387\u20131415\n*[[Francesc de Tovia]] 1415\u20131436\n*[[Arnau Roger de Pallars]] 1436\u20131461\n*[[Jaume de Cardona i Gandia]] 1461\u20131466\n*[[Roderic de Borja i Escriv\u00e0]] 1467\u20131472\n*[[Pere Folc de Cardona]] 1472\u20131515\n*[[Joan d'Esp\u00e9s]] 1515\u20131530\n*''Vacant 1530\u20131532''\n*[[Pedro Jord\u00e1n de Urries]] 1532\u20131533\n*[[Francisco de Urr\u00edes]] 1533\u20131551\n*[[Joan Punyet]] 1551\u20131553\n*[[Miquel Despuig]] 1553\u20131556\n*[[Juan P\u00e9rez Garcia de Oliv\u00e1n]] 1556\u20131560\n*[[Pere de Castellet]] 1561\u20131571\n*[[Joan Dimes Lloris]] 1571\u20131576\n*''Vacant 1576\u20131578''\n*[[Miquel Jeroni Morell]] 1578\u20131579\n*[[Hug Ambr\u00f3s de Montcada]] 1579\u20131586\n*''Vacant 1586\u20131588''\n*Andreu Capella 1588\u20131609\n*Bernat de Salba i Salba 1609\u20131620\n*''Vacant 1620\u20131622''\n*[[Luis D\u00edez de Aux y Armend\u00e1riz]] 1622\u20131627\n*[[Antonio P\u00e9rez (archbishop)]] 1627\u20131632<ref name=CathHierAntPer>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bprza.html \"Archbishop Antonio P\u00e9rez, O.S.B.\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

At the age of sixteen, she has her [[menarche|first menstrual period]] in the showers at school, accidentally bursting a light bulb with her [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. After being humiliated in front of the entire school during the prom, in a cruel prank involving pig's blood, an enraged Carrie uses her powers to massacre her classmates and the entire town of Chamberlain, [[Maine]].\n\n==Novel==\n{{further|Carrie (novel)}}\nCarrie White is blonde-haired with brown eyes, full-figured, shy, lonely, and isolated. She is severely bullied at school. Her widowed mother, [[Margaret White (Stephen King)|Margaret White]], is a religious fanatic who beats her daughter and throws her into a \"prayer closet\" whenever she does something that her mother doesn't like, including experiencing her first menstrual period, which her mother insists is a punishment for some sort of sin.\n\n==Performers==\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] (1976; [[Carrie (1976 film)|theatrical film]])\n* [[Linzi Hateley]] (1988; [[Carrie (musical)|musical]])\n* [[Angela Bettis]] (2002; [[Carrie (2002 film)|television film]])\n* [[Jodelle Ferland]] (2002; television film {{small|(young Carrie in a flashback sequence)}})\n* Molly Ranson (2012; [[Carrie (musical)|musical]])\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] (2013; [[Carrie (2013 film)|theatrical film]])\n* Skyler Wexler (2013; theatrical film {{small|(young Carrie in a flashback sequence)}})\n* [[Madelaine Petsch]] (2018; ''[[Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember|Riverdale: A Night to Remember]]'' {{small|(as [[Cheryl Blossom]]<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/>)}})\n* [[Emilija Baranac]] (2018; ''Riverdale: A Night to Remember'' {{small|(as [[Midge Klump]]<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/>)}})\n\n==Musical==\n{{further|Carrie (musical)}}\n[[File:MWCTM.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Linzi Hateley as Carrie, with Betty Buckley as Margaret White]]\n\nIn 1988, ''Carrie'' was adapted into a musical co-produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. Carrie was portrayed by [[Linzi Hateley]] in both the London production and the Broadway transfer. Her songs include \"And Eve Was Weak,\" \"Evening Prayers\", and \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" (duets with [[Betty Buckley]], who also played teacher Miss Collins in the 1976 film, as her mother) and the solos \"I'm Not Alone\" and \"Carrie\".\n\nLinzi Hateley won a [[Theatre World Award]] for Best Newcomer for this, her first starring role.<ref>{{cite web| title = World Theatre Award Recipients, 1987-88\n| publisher = World Theatre Awards| url = http://www.theatreworldawards.org/award.html| accessdate = 2008-01-29}}</ref> She recorded the song \"Carrie\" for her album ''Sooner or Later''.<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley recordings| url = http://unofficiallinzihateley.homestead.com/recordings.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref>\n\nThe pig's blood scene and the ensuing massacre are depicted in the musical number \"The Destruction\". Carrie seals off the exits, kills everyone present (staged through pyrotechnics and lasers), and brings down the ceiling, burying the promgoers. Carrie sinks to the floor and begins to cry. Margaret arrives in an evening dress, and comforts her. She then stabs Carrie on the school stairs (a \"white-on-white staircase to heaven\") during the song \"Carrie (reprise)\" in a moment described by one scholar as \"the sort of moment [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] might have come up with had a lunatic asked him to stage a [[Grand Guignol]] version of his ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Skal| first = David J.|title = The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror| publisher = Penguin Books| year = 1993 |pages = 369\u201370| isbn = 978-0-14-024002-3}}</ref> Carrie uses her powers to stop Margaret's heart before dying herself, comforted by Sue.\n\n===2012 revival===\nThe 2012 revival of the show portrays a different version of events. The blood is dumped onto Carrie (portrayed by Molly Ranson) from above, as in the book. She slams the doors shut and turns off the lights, creating a blackout. The lights struggle back on in a strobe effect as Carrie forces everyone else to the ground. The students writhe in desperation as Carrie sets the gym on fire, and telekinetically forces Chris Hargensen to break her own neck. Several try to escape but are pinned to the walls. Carrie then leaves, blowing up the gym as she does so. Sue narrates how Carrie cuts a trail of destruction across town on her way home, as Sue herself follows her. At the White home, Carrie finds Margaret reciting prayers. She takes Carrie in her arms and sings softly to her before revealing the kitchen knife and stabbing her. Carrie uses her powers to force the knife out of Margaret's hands before stopping her heart. Sue enters, and cradles Carrie as she dies of her wounds.\n\n==Other media==\nThe television series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' featured an episode based on the musical, \"[[Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember]]\", with series stars [[Madelaine Petsch]] and [[Emilija Baranac]], who played the characters [[Cheryl Blossom]] and [[Midge Klump]] as different versions of Carrie, respectively.<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/> In this story, Cheryl is participate for the role of Carrie in the musical.

At the age of sixteen, she has her [[menarche|first menstrual period]] in the showers at school, accidentally bursting a light bulb with her [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. After being humiliated in front of the entire school during the prom, in a cruel prank involving pig's blood, an enraged Carrie uses her powers to massacre her classmates and the entire town of Chamberlain, [[Maine]].\n\n==Novel==\n{{further|Carrie (novel)}}\nCarrie White is blonde-haired with brown eyes, full-figured, shy, lonely, and isolated. She is severely bullied at school. Her widowed mother, [[Margaret White (Stephen King)|Margaret White]], is a religious fanatic who beats her daughter and throws her into a \"prayer closet\" whenever she does something that her mother doesn't like, including experiencing her first menstrual period, which her mother insists is a punishment for some sort of sin.\n\n==Performers==\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] (1976; [[Carrie (1976 film)|theatrical film]])\n* [[Linzi Hateley]] (1988; [[Carrie (musical)|musical]])\n* [[Angela Bettis]] (2002; [[Carrie (2002 film)|television film]])\n* [[Jodelle Ferland]] (2002; television film {{small|(young Carrie in a flashback sequence)}})\n* Molly Ranson (2012; [[Carrie (musical)|musical]])\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] (2013; [[Carrie (2013 film)|theatrical film]])\n* Skyler Wexler (2013; theatrical film {{small|(young Carrie in a flashback sequence)}})\n* [[Madelaine Petsch]] (2018; ''[[Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember|Riverdale: A Night to Remember]]'' {{small|(as [[Cheryl Blossom]]<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/>)}})\n* [[Emilija Baranac]] (2018; ''Riverdale: A Night to Remember'' {{small|(as [[Midge Klump]]<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/>)}})\n\n==Musical==\n{{further|Carrie (musical)}}\n[[File:MWCTM.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Linzi Hateley as Carrie, with Betty Buckley as Margaret White]]\n\nIn 1988, ''Carrie'' was adapted into a musical co-produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. Carrie was portrayed by [[Linzi Hateley]] in both the London production and the Broadway transfer. Her songs include \"And Eve Was Weak,\" \"Evening Prayers\", and \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" (duets with [[Betty Buckley]], who also played teacher Miss Collins in the 1976 film, as her mother) and the solos \"I'm Not Alone\" and \"Carrie\".\n\nLinzi Hateley won a [[Theatre World Award]] for Best Newcomer for this, her first starring role.<ref>{{cite web| title = World Theatre Award Recipients, 1987-88\n| publisher = World Theatre Awards| url = http://www.theatreworldawards.org/award.html| accessdate = 2008-01-29}}</ref> She recorded the song \"Carrie\" for her album ''Sooner or Later''.<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley recordings| url = http://unofficiallinzihateley.homestead.com/recordings.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref>\n\nThe pig's blood scene and the ensuing massacre are depicted in the musical number \"The Destruction\". Carrie seals off the exits, kills everyone present (staged through pyrotechnics and lasers), and brings down the ceiling, burying the promgoers. Carrie sinks to the floor and begins to cry. Margaret arrives in an evening dress, and comforts her. She then stabs Carrie on the school stairs (a \"white-on-white staircase to heaven\") during the song \"Carrie (reprise)\" in a moment described by one scholar as \"the sort of moment [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] might have come up with had a lunatic asked him to stage a [[Grand Guignol]] version of his ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Skal| first = David J.|title = The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror| publisher = Penguin Books| year = 1993 |pages = 369\u201370| isbn = 978-0-14-024002-3}}</ref> Carrie uses her powers to stop Margaret's heart before dying herself, comforted by Sue.\n\n===2012 revival===\nThe 2012 revival of the show portrays a different version of events. The blood is dumped onto Carrie (portrayed by Molly Ranson) from above, as in the book. She slams the doors shut and turns off the lights, creating a blackout. The lights struggle back on in a strobe effect as Carrie forces everyone else to the ground. The students writhe in desperation as Carrie sets the gym on fire, and telekinetically forces Chris Hargensen to break her own neck. Several try to escape but are pinned to the walls. Carrie then leaves, blowing up the gym as she does so. Sue narrates how Carrie cuts a trail of destruction across town on her way home, as Sue herself follows her. At the White home, Carrie finds Margaret reciting prayers. She takes Carrie in her arms and sings softly to her before revealing the kitchen knife and stabbing her. Carrie uses her powers to force the knife out of Margaret's hands before stopping her heart. Sue enters, and cradles Carrie as she dies of her wounds.\n\n==Other media==\nThe television series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' featured an episode based on the musical, \"[[Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember]]\", with series stars [[Madelaine Petsch]] and [[Emilija Baranac]], who played the characters [[Cheryl Blossom]] and [[Midge Klump]] as different versions of Carrie, respectively.<ref name=\"riverdalecarrie\"/> In this story, Cheryl is participate for the role of Carrie in the musical.

Ten miles south of the site of Springfield, the Lenape had built a substantial dwelling of houses that borrowed elements of Anglo colonial style from the mid-Atlantic, where their people had migrated from.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first European-American settlers to the area were John Polk Campbell and his brother, who moved to the area in 1829 from Tennessee. Campbell chose the area because of the presence of a natural well that flowed into a small stream. He staked his claim by carving his initials in a tree.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell was joined by settlers Thomas Finney, Samuel Weaver, and Joseph Miller. They proceeded to clear the land of trees to develop it for farms. A small general store was soon opened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1833, the southern part of the state was named Greene County after Revolutionary War hero [[Nathanael Greene|General Nathanael Greene]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gcmohs/2nd_level/brief_history.html|title=A brief history of Greene County, Missouri|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The legislature deeded 50 acres of land to John Campbell for the creation of a county seat in 1835.

In the late 1850s, telegraph lines, previously only to St. Louis, reached Springfield. News from point further west was brought to Springfield overland and then sent by telegraph to what was then called the New York Associated Press. At the start of the [[American Civil War]], Springfield was divided in its loyalty, as it had been settled by people from both the North and South, as well as by German immigrants in the mid-19th century who tended to support the Union.\n\nThe Union and Confederate armies both recognized the city's strategic importance and sought to control it. They fought the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] on August 10, 1861, a few miles southwest of town.<ref name=\":0\" /> The battle was a Confederate victory, and [[Nathaniel Lyon]] became the first Union General killed in Civil War. Union troops retreated to [[Lebanon, Missouri|Lebanon]] to regroup. When they returned, they found that most of the Confederate army had withdrawn.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn October 25, 1861, Union Major [[Charles Zagonyi]] led an attack against the remaining Confederates in the area, in a battle known as the [[Battle of Springfield I|First Battle of Springfield]], or Zagonyi's Charge. Zagonyi's men removed the Confederate flag from Springfield's public square and returned to camp. It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thelibrary.org/lochist/historicalsites/17.cfm|title=Zagonyi's Charge|website=thelibrary.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The increased military activity in the area set the stage for the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northern Arkansas in March 1862.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under General [[John S. Marmaduke]] advanced to take control of Springfield and an urban fight ensued. But that evening, the Confederates withdrew. This became known as the [[Battle of Springfield II|Second Battle of Springfield]]. Marmaduke sent a message to the Union forces asking that the Confederate casualties have a proper burial. The city remained under Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\":2\" /> The US army used Springfield as a supply base and central point of operation for military activities in the area.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===\"Wild\" Bill Hickok===\nPromptly after the Civil War ended on July 21, 1865 [[Wild Bill Hickok]] shot and killed [[Davis Tutt]] in a [[Wild Bill Hickok \u2013 Davis Tutt shootout|shootout]] over a disagreement about a debt Tutt claimed Hickok owed him. During a poker game at the former Lyon House Hotel, in response to the disagreement over the amount, Tutt had taken Hickok's watch, which Hickok demanded he return immediately. Hickok warned that Tutt had better not be seen wearing that watch, then spotted him wearing it in Park Central Square, prompting the gunfight.\n\nOn January 25, 1866, Hickok was still in Springfield when he witnessed a Springfield police officer, John Orr, shoot and kill James Coleman after Coleman interfered with the arrest of Coleman's friend Bingham, who was drunk and disorderly. Hickok provided testimony in the case. Orr was arrested, released on bail, and immediately fled the country. He was never brought to trial or heard from again.<ref>https://thelibrary.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch30pt1.html</ref>\n\n===Lynchings===\nThe period after [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and into the early 20th century continued to be socially volatile, with whites attacking blacks in the South. Some cities and counties in Missouri, particularly in former slaveholding areas, also had lynchings of [[freedmen]] and their descendants.\n\nOn April 14, 1906, a white mob broke into the Springfield county jail, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] two black men, Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail, where other African-American prisoners were being held, and pulled out Will Allen, who had been accused of murdering a white man. All three suspects were hanged from the Gottfried Tower, which held a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], and burned in the courthouse square by a mob of more than 2,000 whites. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury, but no one was prosecuted. The proceedings were covered by national newspapers, the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/>\n\nDuncan's and Coker's employer testified that they were at his business at the time of the crime against Edwards, and other evidence suggested that they and Allen were all innocent.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/><ref name=\"harper\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QRR-xMoF0BIC&dq=William+Allen,+Springfield,+April+15,+1906&source=gbs_navlinks_s  Kimberly Harper, ''White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909''], University of Arkansas Press, 2012, pp. 144-145</ref> These three are the only recorded lynchings in Greene County.<ref name=\"lynching\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/ ''Supplement: Lynchings by County, 3rd edition''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 7</ref> But the extrajudicial murders were part of a pattern of discrimination, repeated violence and intimidation of African Americans in this city and southwest Missouri from 1894 to 1909, in an attempt to expel them from the region.<ref name=\"harper1\"/> Whites in [[Lawrence County, Missouri|Lawrence County]] also lynched three African-American men in this period.<ref name=\"lynching\"/> After the mass lynching in Springfield, many African Americans left the area in a large exodus.<ref name=\"harper1\">Harper (2012), ''White Man's Heaven</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, the African American population has experienced steady [[minority group|minority]] growth in Springfield and throughout the Ozarks.

The average commuting time was 17.7 minutes from 2013 to 2017.<ref> https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/springfieldcitymissouri/IPE120218</ref>\n\nMajor streets include Glenstone Avenue, Sunshine Street ([[Missouri Route 413]]), National Avenue, Division Street, Campbell Avenue, Kansas Expressway, Battlefield Road, Republic Road, West Bypass, Chestnut Expressway and Kearney Street.\n[[File:US-65 at I-44.jpg|thumb|Highway 65 leading to I-44]]\nSpringfield is also the site of the first [[diverging diamond interchange]] within the United States, at the intersection of [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Missouri Route 13|MO-13 (Kansas Expressway)]] (at {{Coord|37.2503|-93.3107|name=Springfield, Missouri diverging diamond interchange|display=inline|scale:3000}}).\n\n[[U.S. Route 66 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 66]] and [[U.S. Route 166 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 166]] formerly passed through Springfield, and sections of historic US 66 can still be seen in the city. US 166's eastern terminus was once in the northeast section of the city, and US 60 (westbound) originally ended in downtown Springfield. US 60 now goes through town on [[James River Freeway]]. In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Schoolcraft Freeway (Highway 65) and James River Freeway (Highway 60) through the city to Interstate 44. The main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Springfield-Branson National Airport]] (SGF) serves the city with direct flights to 13 cities. It is the principal air gateway to the Springfield region. The [[Downtown Airport (Missouri)|Downtown Airport]] is also a public-use airport located near downtown. In May 2009, the Springfield-Branson airport opened a new passenger terminal. Financing included $97 million in revenue bonds issued by the airport and $20 million of discretionary federal aviation funds, with no city taxes used. The building includes {{convert|275000|sqft|m2}}, 10 gates (expandable to 60) and 1,826 parking spaces. Direct connections from Springfield are available to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Destin\u2013Fort Walton Beach Airport|Destin/Fort Walton Beach]], [[Punta Gorda Airport (Florida)|Punta Gorda/Fort Myers]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando]], [[Phoenix\u2013Mesa Gateway Airport|Phoenix]] and [[St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport|Tampa]]. No international flights have regular service into Springfield-Branson, but it does serve international charters.\n\n===Trains===\nPassenger trains have not served Springfield since 1967, but more than 65 freight trains travel to, from, and through the city each day. Springfield was once home to the headquarters and main shops of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway|(Frisco)]]. Into the 1960s, the Kansas City-Florida Special ran from Kansas City to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Sunnyland ran between Kansas City and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans]]. The railroad also operated two daily trains to [[St. Louis]] through Springfield: the [[Meteor (train)|Meteor]] and the Will Rogers''.'' Both continued southwest to Oklahoma City via Tulsa. The Meteor continued on to [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe Frisco was absorbed by the [[Burlington Northern]] (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis and Tulsa converge at the railroad's yard facility in northern Springfield. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily [[intermodal freight train]]s between the West Coast and the Southeast. The [[Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad]] also operates several miles of (former [[Missouri Pacific]]) industrial track in the city.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:USMCEntrancewayMissouri.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]]]]\nSpringfield is a regional medical hub with the healthcare field employing a large number of people in the city. Major care providers include [[CoxHealth]], [[Mercy (healthcare organization)|Mercy]], Ozarks Community Hospital and Jordan Valley Community Health Center, with Mercy being classified amongst the top 100 hospitals in the country.<ref name=\"news-leader.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/business/2015/03/28/mercy-hospital-named-top-hospitals-list/70582286/|title=Mercy Hospital named to top 100 hospitals list|website=Springfield News-Leader|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> The city's healthcare systems offer every specialty listed by the [[American Medical Association]].

It is a seven time top 100 hospital system operating six hospitals, over 80 clinics, health plans and other facilities and employing over 12,100 people in southwest Missouri and [[Northwest Arkansas]]. The largest of the network's hospitals, [[Cox South]], recently underwent a large expansion on its south tower. It is a level one trauma, stroke, and STEMI Center. Cox also runs a [[Children's Miracle Network Hospitals|Children's Miracle Network Hospital]] for specialized pediatric care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coxhealth.com/newsroom/2017-record-setting-year-childrens-miracle-network-hospitals-coxhealth/|title=2017 a record-setting year for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals at CoxHealth|website=www.coxhealth.com|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> Cox has the only hospital in southwest Missouri designate a Level 1 Stroke Center.<ref name=\"news-leader.com\"/>\n\nMercy Health System, based in [[St. Louis]], is a [[Level 1 Trauma Center]], and runs a pediatric cancer center.

Both Cox and Mercy maintain [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]] and houses for families of those who have children undergoing medical treatment.\n\nThe [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]], one of six federal institutions designed to handle federal inmates' medical concerns, is located at the corner of W. Sunshine Street and Kansas Expressway.<ref>\"[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/spg/index.jsp MCPF Springfield].\" [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. Retrieved on May 20, 2010.</ref> Several high-profile criminals, including several [[Mob Boss|mob bosses]] have been housed at the center. Among them, [[Joseph Bonanno]] of the [[Bonanno crime family]] and [[John Gotti]] of the [[Gambino crime family]], who died in the center. The center also housed mass murderer [[Jared Lee Loughner]], who perpetrated the [[2011 Tucson shooting]] injuring [[US Representative]] [[Gabby Giffords]].\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Print ===\nThe city's major daily newspaper is the ''[[Springfield News-Leader]],'' which circulates to more than 50,000 people on Sundays. Other newspapers for Springfield include ''Daily Events'', ''Springfield Business Journal,'' which is a weekly paper that provides comprehensive business news, and ''The Standard'' which is Missouri State University's in-school newspaper.,\n\nIn addition to newspapers, Springfield is the base of 417 Magazine, a local lifestyle and entertainment magazine showcasing restaurants, attractions and local businesses in the [[417 area code]]. The Magazine also maintains 417 Biz for business and networking information highlighting local businesspeople and entrepreneurs, as well as 417 Bride for wedding and bridal related content.\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Springfield media market ranks 72nd in the nation, amongst markets like [[Toledo, Ohio]] and [[Tucson, Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/tv/2018-19-dma-ranker.pdf|title=Media markets|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The area is composed of 31 counties in southwest Missouri and Arkansas.

Ten miles south of the site of Springfield, the Lenape had built a substantial dwelling of houses that borrowed elements of Anglo colonial style from the mid-Atlantic, where their people had migrated from.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first European-American settlers to the area were John Polk Campbell and his brother, who moved to the area in 1829 from Tennessee. Campbell chose the area because of the presence of a natural well that flowed into a small stream. He staked his claim by carving his initials in a tree.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell was joined by settlers Thomas Finney, Samuel Weaver, and Joseph Miller. They proceeded to clear the land of trees to develop it for farms. A small general store was soon opened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1833, the southern part of the state was named Greene County after Revolutionary War hero [[Nathanael Greene|General Nathanael Greene]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gcmohs/2nd_level/brief_history.html|title=A brief history of Greene County, Missouri|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The legislature deeded 50 acres of land to John Campbell for the creation of a county seat in 1835.

In the late 1850s, telegraph lines, previously only to St. Louis, reached Springfield. News from point further west was brought to Springfield overland and then sent by telegraph to what was then called the New York Associated Press. At the start of the [[American Civil War]], Springfield was divided in its loyalty, as it had been settled by people from both the North and South, as well as by German immigrants in the mid-19th century who tended to support the Union.\n\nThe Union and Confederate armies both recognized the city's strategic importance and sought to control it. They fought the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] on August 10, 1861, a few miles southwest of town.<ref name=\":0\" /> The battle was a Confederate victory, and [[Nathaniel Lyon]] became the first Union General killed in Civil War. Union troops retreated to [[Lebanon, Missouri|Lebanon]] to regroup. When they returned, they found that most of the Confederate army had withdrawn.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn October 25, 1861, Union Major [[Charles Zagonyi]] led an attack against the remaining Confederates in the area, in a battle known as the [[Battle of Springfield I|First Battle of Springfield]], or Zagonyi's Charge. Zagonyi's men removed the Confederate flag from Springfield's public square and returned to camp. It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thelibrary.org/lochist/historicalsites/17.cfm|title=Zagonyi's Charge|website=thelibrary.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref> The increased military activity in the area set the stage for the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northern Arkansas in March 1862.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under General [[John S. Marmaduke]] advanced to take control of Springfield and an urban fight ensued. But that evening, the Confederates withdrew. This became known as the [[Battle of Springfield II|Second Battle of Springfield]]. Marmaduke sent a message to the Union forces asking that the Confederate casualties have a proper burial. The city remained under Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\":2\" /> The US army used Springfield as a supply base and central point of operation for military activities in the area.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===\"Wild\" Bill Hickok===\nPromptly after the Civil War ended on July 21, 1865 [[Wild Bill Hickok]] shot and killed [[Davis Tutt]] in a [[Wild Bill Hickok \u2013 Davis Tutt shootout|shootout]] over a disagreement about a debt Tutt claimed Hickok owed him. During a poker game at the former Lyon House Hotel, in response to the disagreement over the amount, Tutt had taken Hickok's watch, which Hickok demanded he return immediately. Hickok warned that Tutt had better not be seen wearing that watch, then spotted him wearing it in Park Central Square, prompting the gunfight.\n\nOn January 25, 1866, Hickok was still in Springfield when he witnessed a Springfield police officer, John Orr, shoot and kill James Coleman after Coleman interfered with the arrest of Coleman's friend Bingham, who was drunk and disorderly. Hickok provided testimony in the case. Orr was arrested, released on bail, and immediately fled the country. He was never brought to trial or heard from again.<ref>https://thelibrary.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch30pt1.html</ref>\n\n===Lynchings===\nThe period after [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and into the early 20th century continued to be socially volatile, with whites attacking blacks in the South. Some cities and counties in Missouri, particularly in former slaveholding areas, also had lynchings of [[freedmen]] and their descendants.\n\nOn April 14, 1906, a white mob broke into the Springfield county jail, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] two black men, Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail, where other African-American prisoners were being held, and pulled out Will Allen, who had been accused of murdering a white man. All three suspects were hanged from the Gottfried Tower, which held a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], and burned in the courthouse square by a mob of more than 2,000 whites. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury, but no one was prosecuted. The proceedings were covered by national newspapers, the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/>\n\nDuncan's and Coker's employer testified that they were at his business at the time of the crime against Edwards, and other evidence suggested that they and Allen were all innocent.<ref name=\"aamuseum\"/><ref name=\"harper\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QRR-xMoF0BIC&dq=William+Allen,+Springfield,+April+15,+1906&source=gbs_navlinks_s  Kimberly Harper, ''White Man's Heaven: The Lynching and Expulsion of Blacks in the Southern Ozarks, 1894-1909''], University of Arkansas Press, 2012, pp. 144-145</ref> These three are the only recorded lynchings in Greene County.<ref name=\"lynching\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/ ''Supplement: Lynchings by County, 3rd edition''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 7</ref> But the extrajudicial murders were part of a pattern of discrimination, repeated violence and intimidation of African Americans in this city and southwest Missouri from 1894 to 1909, in an attempt to expel them from the region.<ref name=\"harper1\"/> Whites in [[Lawrence County, Missouri|Lawrence County]] also lynched three African-American men in this period.<ref name=\"lynching\"/> After the mass lynching in Springfield, many African Americans left the area in a large exodus.<ref name=\"harper1\">Harper (2012), ''White Man's Heaven</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, the African American population has experienced steady [[minority group|minority]] growth in Springfield and throughout the Ozarks.

The average commuting time was 17.7 minutes from 2013 to 2017.<ref> https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/springfieldcitymissouri/IPE120218</ref>\n\nMajor streets include Glenstone Avenue, Sunshine Street ([[Missouri Route 413]]), National Avenue, Division Street, Campbell Avenue, Kansas Expressway, Battlefield Road, Republic Road, West Bypass, Chestnut Expressway and Kearney Street.\n[[File:US-65 at I-44.jpg|thumb|Highway 65 leading to I-44]]\nSpringfield is also the site of the first [[diverging diamond interchange]] within the United States, at the intersection of [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Missouri Route 13|MO-13 (Kansas Expressway)]] (at {{Coord|37.2503|-93.3107|name=Springfield, Missouri diverging diamond interchange|display=inline|scale:3000}}).\n\n[[U.S. Route 66 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 66]] and [[U.S. Route 166 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 166]] formerly passed through Springfield, and sections of historic US 66 can still be seen in the city. US 166's eastern terminus was once in the northeast section of the city, and US 60 (westbound) originally ended in downtown Springfield. US 60 now goes through town on [[James River Freeway]]. In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Schoolcraft Freeway (Highway 65) and James River Freeway (Highway 60) through the city to Interstate 44. The main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Springfield-Branson National Airport]] (SGF) serves the city with direct flights to 13 cities. It is the principal air gateway to the Springfield region. The [[Downtown Airport (Missouri)|Downtown Airport]] is also a public-use airport located near downtown. In May 2009, the Springfield-Branson airport opened a new passenger terminal. Financing included $97 million in revenue bonds issued by the airport and $20 million of discretionary federal aviation funds, with no city taxes used. The building includes {{convert|275000|sqft|m2}}, 10 gates (expandable to 60) and 1,826 parking spaces. Direct connections from Springfield are available to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Destin\u2013Fort Walton Beach Airport|Destin/Fort Walton Beach]], [[Punta Gorda Airport (Florida)|Punta Gorda/Fort Myers]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando]], [[Phoenix\u2013Mesa Gateway Airport|Phoenix]] and [[St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport|Tampa]]. No international flights have regular service into Springfield-Branson, but it does serve international charters.\n\n===Trains===\nPassenger trains have not served Springfield since 1967, but more than 65 freight trains travel to, from, and through the city each day. Springfield was once home to the headquarters and main shops of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway|(Frisco)]]. Into the 1960s, the Kansas City-Florida Special ran from Kansas City to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Sunnyland ran between Kansas City and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans]]. The railroad also operated two daily trains to [[St. Louis]] through Springfield: the [[Meteor (train)|Meteor]] and the Will Rogers''.'' Both continued southwest to Oklahoma City via Tulsa. The Meteor continued on to [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe Frisco was absorbed by the [[Burlington Northern]] (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis and Tulsa converge at the railroad's yard facility in northern Springfield. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily [[intermodal freight train]]s between the West Coast and the Southeast. The [[Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad]] also operates several miles of (former [[Missouri Pacific]]) industrial track in the city.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:USMCEntrancewayMissouri.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]]]]\nSpringfield is a regional medical hub with the healthcare field employing a large number of people in the city. Major care providers include [[CoxHealth]], [[Mercy (healthcare organization)|Mercy]], Ozarks Community Hospital and Jordan Valley Community Health Center, with Mercy being classified amongst the top 100 hospitals in the country.<ref name=\"news-leader.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/business/2015/03/28/mercy-hospital-named-top-hospitals-list/70582286/|title=Mercy Hospital named to top 100 hospitals list|website=Springfield News-Leader|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> The city's healthcare systems offer every specialty listed by the [[American Medical Association]].

It is a seven time top 100 hospital system operating six hospitals, over 80 clinics, health plans and other facilities and employing over 12,100 people in southwest Missouri and [[Northwest Arkansas]]. The largest of the network's hospitals, [[Cox South]], recently underwent a large expansion on its south tower. It is a level one trauma, stroke, and STEMI Center. Cox also runs a [[Children's Miracle Network Hospitals|Children's Miracle Network Hospital]] for specialized pediatric care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coxhealth.com/newsroom/2017-record-setting-year-childrens-miracle-network-hospitals-coxhealth/|title=2017 a record-setting year for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals at CoxHealth|website=www.coxhealth.com|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> Cox has the only hospital in southwest Missouri designate a Level 1 Stroke Center.<ref name=\"news-leader.com\"/>\n\nMercy Health System, based in [[St. Louis]], is a [[Level 1 Trauma Center]], and runs a pediatric cancer center.

Both Cox and Mercy maintain [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]] and houses for families of those who have children undergoing medical treatment.\n\nThe [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]], one of six federal institutions designed to handle federal inmates' medical concerns, is located at the corner of W. Sunshine Street and Kansas Expressway.<ref>\"[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/spg/index.jsp MCPF Springfield].\" [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]].

Among them, [[Joseph Bonanno]] of the [[Bonanno crime family]] and [[John Gotti]] of the [[Gambino crime family]], who died in the center. The center also housed mass murderer [[Jared Lee Loughner]], who perpetrated the [[2011 Tucson shooting]] injuring [[US Representative]] [[Gabby Giffords]].\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Print ===\nThe city's major daily newspaper is the ''[[Springfield News-Leader]],'' which circulates to more than 50,000 people on Sundays. Other newspapers for Springfield include ''Daily Events'', ''Springfield Business Journal,'' which is a weekly paper that provides comprehensive business news, and ''The Standard'' which is Missouri State University's in-school newspaper.,\n\nIn addition to newspapers, Springfield is the base of 417 Magazine, a local lifestyle and entertainment magazine showcasing restaurants, attractions and local businesses in the [[417 area code]]. The Magazine also maintains 417 Biz for business and networking information highlighting local businesspeople and entrepreneurs, as well as 417 Bride for wedding and bridal related content.\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Springfield media market ranks 72nd in the nation, amongst markets like [[Toledo, Ohio]] and [[Tucson, Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/tv/2018-19-dma-ranker.pdf|title=Media markets|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The area is composed of 31 counties in southwest Missouri and Arkansas.

He studied music at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]] universities, and composition with [[Hans Werner Henze]] in London and [[Italy]].<ref>Biography on official website: http://www.peterfribbins.co.uk/about.html</ref>\n\nA number of his key works are literary-inspired, and much of his music is for [[string instrument|strings]], notable exceptions being the early [[wind quintet]] 'In Xanadu' from 1992 (after [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]), 'Porphyria's Lover' (1999) for [[flute]] and [[piano]] (after [[Robert Browning|Browning]]), and the [[clarinet]] and piano '...That Which Echoes in Eternity' (after lines from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] [[Divine Comedy]]). Of his two [[string quartet]]s, the first is subtitled 'I Have the Serpent Brought' after lines by [[John Donne]] from his poem 'Twicknam Garden', and the second (2006) commissioned by the [[Chilingirian Quartet]] ([[Levon Chilingirian]]), subtitled 'After Cromer' since much of the thematic material is derived from the English hymn of the same name. Other chamber works for strings include two [[piano trio]]s - the first, more substantial one premiered in [[Vienna]] in 2004, and the latter, an evocative single-movement piece (2007) entitled 'Softly, in the Dusk...' after the poem 'Piano' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] - a [[Cello]] Sonata commissioned by [[Raphael Wallfisch]] and John York (2005) and the Quintet for Clarinet and Strings (2002). Larger scale works include the Piano Concerto (2010), which is subtitled 'The Moving Finger Writes'; a quotation from FitzGerald's translation of [[The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]],<ref>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/246/246-h/246-h.htm</ref> and the Violin Concerto (2015) commissioned by the French violinist Philippe Graffin.<ref>http://carolinebairdartists.co.uk/html/graffin-biog.htm</ref> There are also songs and various smaller instrumental works.\n\nPeter Fribbins is also Director of Music at [[Middlesex University]],<ref>Profile Page on Middlesex University Website: http://www.mdx.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-directory/fribbins-peter</ref> London (since 2004) and Artistic Director of the long-established series of Sunday London Chamber Music Society Concerts,<ref>London chamber Music Society Website: http://www.londonchambermusic.org.uk/contact-location-information/</ref> formerly at [[Conway Hall]] and resident at [[Kings Place]] since 2008.\n\nHis concert work is often linked with a group of British composers called 'Music Haven', not a school as such, but a collection of composers (c.f. the French '[[Les Six]]' or the British '[[New Music Manchester|Manchester School]]', from the early and late twentieth-century respectively), mostly London-based and with broadly similar interests and aesthetic outlook, reflecting sympathies for British masters such as [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] and [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]] and the music of the [[First Viennese School]], especially [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], as well as the [[Scandinavia]]n influences of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen|Nielsen]]. The group includes [[James Francis Brown]], [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]]-born Alan Mills, [[Matthew Taylor (composer)|Matthew Taylor]], John Hawkins, Geoff Palmer, and more peripherally two older British composers, [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]] and by association, [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]] CBE. The set of piano pieces 'Seven Haydn Fantasies for John McCabe' - each composed by a different composer and published in 2009 on the occasion of the latter's 70th birthday - is in many ways typical of the group's work.\n\n==Recordings<ref>Dromey, Christopher. \"Prospects for Neomodernism in the Music of Matthew Taylor and Peter Fribbins\".

He studied music at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]] universities, and composition with [[Hans Werner Henze]] in London and [[Italy]].<ref>Biography on official website: http://www.peterfribbins.co.uk/about.html</ref>\n\nA number of his key works are literary-inspired, and much of his music is for [[string instrument|strings]], notable exceptions being the early [[wind quintet]] 'In Xanadu' from 1992 (after [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]), 'Porphyria's Lover' (1999) for [[flute]] and [[piano]] (after [[Robert Browning|Browning]]), and the [[clarinet]] and piano '...That Which Echoes in Eternity' (after lines from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] [[Divine Comedy]]). Of his two [[string quartet]]s, the first is subtitled 'I Have the Serpent Brought' after lines by [[John Donne]] from his poem 'Twicknam Garden', and the second (2006) commissioned by the [[Chilingirian Quartet]] ([[Levon Chilingirian]]), subtitled 'After Cromer' since much of the thematic material is derived from the English hymn of the same name. Other chamber works for strings include two [[piano trio]]s - the first, more substantial one premiered in [[Vienna]] in 2004, and the latter, an evocative single-movement piece (2007) entitled 'Softly, in the Dusk...' after the poem 'Piano' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] - a [[Cello]] Sonata commissioned by [[Raphael Wallfisch]] and John York (2005) and the Quintet for Clarinet and Strings (2002). Larger scale works include the Piano Concerto (2010), which is subtitled 'The Moving Finger Writes'; a quotation from FitzGerald's translation of [[The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]],<ref>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/246/246-h/246-h.htm</ref> and the Violin Concerto (2015) commissioned by the French violinist Philippe Graffin.<ref>http://carolinebairdartists.co.uk/html/graffin-biog.htm</ref> There are also songs and various smaller instrumental works.\n\nPeter Fribbins is also Director of Music at [[Middlesex University]],<ref>Profile Page on Middlesex University Website: http://www.mdx.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-directory/fribbins-peter</ref> London (since 2004) and Artistic Director of the long-established series of Sunday London Chamber Music Society Concerts,<ref>London chamber Music Society Website: http://www.londonchambermusic.org.uk/contact-location-information/</ref> formerly at [[Conway Hall]] and resident at [[Kings Place]] since 2008.\n\nHis concert work is often linked with a group of British composers called 'Music Haven', not a school as such, but a collection of composers (c.f. the French '[[Les Six]]' or the British '[[New Music Manchester|Manchester School]]', from the early and late twentieth-century respectively), mostly London-based and with broadly similar interests and aesthetic outlook, reflecting sympathies for British masters such as [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] and [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]] and the music of the [[First Viennese School]], especially [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], as well as the [[Scandinavia]]n influences of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen|Nielsen]]. The group includes [[James Francis Brown]], [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]]-born Alan Mills, [[Matthew Taylor (composer)|Matthew Taylor]], John Hawkins, Geoff Palmer, and more peripherally two older British composers, [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]] and by association, [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]] CBE. The set of piano pieces 'Seven Haydn Fantasies for John McCabe' - each composed by a different composer and published in 2009 on the occasion of the latter's 70th birthday - is in many ways typical of the group's work.\n\n==Recordings<ref>Dromey, Christopher. \"Prospects for Neomodernism in the Music of Matthew Taylor and Peter Fribbins\".
