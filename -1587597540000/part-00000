[[Don Reo]] created the series, which starred [[Mayim Bialik]] as Blossom Russo, a teenager living with her father and two elder brothers.<ref name=bernstein/><ref name=johnson>{{cite news|title='Blossom' Goes Off to College as Series Concludes Tonight|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 22, 1995|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-22/entertainment/ca-4746_1_floppy-hat|author=Johnson, Ted}}</ref><ref name=weinstein>{{cite news|title=Against All the Odds, 'Blossom' Is Blooming|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 15, 1993|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-02-15-ca-119-story.html|author=Weinstein, Steve}}</ref> It was produced by Reo's Impact Zone Productions and [[Witt/Thomas Productions]] in association with [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series focuses on the life of Blossom Russo ([[Mayim Bialik]]), an [[Italian-American]] teenager. It began with Blossom's mother having left the family to pursue her own life and career, and focused on the family's attempts to adjust. Blossom's father, Nick, an overprotective, somewhat conservative session musician who was frequently between gigs and tours,  was played by [[Ted Wass (actor)|Ted Wass]]. Her older brother Tony ([[Michael Stoyanov]]) was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who eventually became a paramedic. Joey ([[Joey Lawrence]]), the middle child (called Donnie in the pilot), was a stereotypical \"[[Jock (subculture)|dumb jock]]\", known for the drawn-out delivery of his catchphrase \"Whoa!\" Blossom frequently received advice in fantasy scenes, from celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[David Spade]], [[ALF (TV series)|ALF]], [[Will Smith]], and [[God]] (played by [[Don Novello]]). Blossom's mother, Maddy Russo, was played by [[Melissa Manchester]].\n\nBlossom's best friend Six Lemeure ([[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) also played a significant part in her life. Six, an especially fast talker, was best known for her tendency to ramble.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Blossom Ruby Russo''' (played by [[Mayim Bialik]]) \u2013 The youngest child and only daughter of Nick and Maddy Russo,<ref name=weinstein/> best friend of Six, and longtime on-again off-again girlfriend of Vinnie. Blossom learns many hard lessons from the lives of herself, her family and Six, including about abuse, alcohol, drugs, divorce, and many more. Blossom is especially close to her family (including maternal grandfather, Buzz) and develops a strong relationship with her father and two brothers (partially due to the abandonment of her mother). In later seasons, after Nick remarries, Blossom resents but eventually grows to respect her stepmother Carol and new step-sister, Kennedy. In one episode, Blossom learns from Nick that she was named after jazz singer [[Blossom Dearie]].\n*'''Joseph \"Joey\" Russo''' (played by [[Joey Lawrence]] as a teenager, [[Matthew Lawrence]] at age 11, [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] at age 2) \u2013 A not-so-smart baseball player, ladies' man and middle child. Joey once questions his paternity after believing that there was a mix up at the hospital at the time of his birth (with Blossom and Tony joking that he lacks the Russo \"nose\"). He can be sweet and smart when he can put in effort. Despite his dopiness, Joey gets accepted to [[Arizona State University]], but decides to play professional baseball after graduating from high school. His catch phrase is \"Whoa!\"  \n*'''Anthony \"Tony\" Russo''' (played by [[Michael Stoyanov]]) \u2013 A recovering drug addict and alcoholic, he has difficulty remembering four years of his life, but still remembers his addictions well enough to warn Joey and Blossom of what happened, marijuana and alcohol having been crutches for his pressures of school life and their parents' separation .<ref name=bernstein/> He worked at a doughnut shop for a while before becoming a [[paramedic]]. He is extremely close to Blossom, who often comes to him for advice. He has a long term relationship with a Playboy bunny, Rhonda, but later marries Shelly in [[Las Vegas]], after a night of debauchery. Despite the suddenness of their wedding, they decide to give the relationship a try and ultimately decide to stay together. Tony and Shelly welcome a son, Nash Metropolitan Russo, into the world in November 1994. In a crossover with ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', Hilary Banks went on a date with Tony after winning a charity auction. The character was named after the show's executive producer [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]].\n*'''Nicholas \"Nick\" Russo''' (played by [[Ted Wass (actor)|Ted Wass]]) \u2013 The father of Blossom, Joey and Tony. The main caregiver for his three children after his wife, Maddy, leaves the family. He works as a piano player, playing various gigs with a wide range of bands. He and Carol eventually get married, making him the stepfather to Carol's daughter, Kennedy, and he later becomes the grandfather to Tony's child. Nick also treats Blossom's friend, Six, as his own daughter. Because of Tony's alcoholism and drug addiction, he has become overprotective of Joey and Blossom, and has developed a somewhat conservative attitude to parenting. In the pilot, the father was named Terry Russo (played by [[Richard Masur]]), who worked as an [[accountant]].\n*'''Six Dorothy Lemeure''' (played by [[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) \u2013 Blossom's best friend who has a crush on Joey. Her parents are divorced. In the pilot, she alludes to the fact that she was named Six because of the number of beers her father drank in order to get her mother pregnant. A later explanation is that she was the sixth child in her family, although none of her siblings are ever seen. Six goes through many hard times including becoming an alcoholic, dating a married older man, and a pregnancy scare. She thinks of the Russo family as her own family and talks rapidly when she is happy, angry, or nervous. Producers originally offered the role to [[Melissa Joan Hart]], who declined and took the lead role on ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' instead.<ref name=gonzalez>{{cite journal| url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/07/12/melissa-joan-hart-explains-it-all/| title=Melissa Joan Hart 'Explains It All' to EW, including how 'Melissa & Joey' is racier than you think| work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]| last=Gonzalez| first=Sandra| date=July 12, 2011| accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref> Von O\u00ff is credited in the pilot's opening sequence, but for the first season was moved to the closing credits as a \"guest star\".

With the cancellation of ''Lenny'' by March 1991, von O\u00ff had reclaimed her originally intended status as a regular ''Blossom'' cast member and in season two moved back to the opening credits.\n*'''Vincent \"Vinnie\" Bonitardi''' (played by [[David Lascher]]) \u2013 Blossom's on-again, off-again boyfriend. Nick does not always like him, but their relationship improves over time. Vinnie gets along with Blossom's family for the most part and though he projects a tough-guy image, can be quite sweet at times.\n*'''Rhonda Jo Applegate''' (played by [[Portia Dawson]]) \u2013 Tony's former on-again, off-again girlfriend. Rhonda is a pin-up model on whom Joey also has a crush.\n*'''Buzz Richman''' (played by [[Barnard Hughes]]) \u2013 Father of Maddy and grandfather of Blossom, Joey, and Tony. Buzz is a war veteran and has been married multiple times, but Ruby was his first and Maddy's mother.

(In the pilot, the mother was named Barbara Russo, played by [[Barrie Youngfellow]], who had not left the family.)\n*'''Sharon Lemeure''' ([[Gail Edwards]]) \u2013 The mother of Six who is divorced and dated Nick at one time. Sharon tries to be a good mother, although Six gets in some trouble at times. She is almost identical to her daughter in several ways, including her habit of talking very fast when nervous, upset, or happy. She and her daughter have been known to mirror each other on several occasions.\n*'''Shelly Lewis Russo''' (Samaria Graham) \u2013 Wife of Tony and mother of Nash.<ref name=mendoza>{{cite news| title=Samaria Graham: Is she what 'Blossom' needs to stay fresh?| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-13/news/tv-33323_1_samaria-graham| first=N.F.| last=Mendoza| date=March 13, 1994| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]| accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref> She is an [[illustrator]] who planned to marry her boyfriend Roscoe in Las Vegas when she got drunk, married Tony, then fell in love.

The genesis of the project that eventually became ''Blossom'' occurred soon after Reo's association with Witt and Thomas began, and coincided with another series they were bringing to CBS in 1989, ''[[Heartland (1989 TV series)|Heartland]]''. The project that would be ''Blossom'' had two sources of inspiration. The creation process was born when Reo attended a family party thrown by his long-time friend [[Dion DiMucci]], the lead singer of [[Dion and the Belmonts]]. Reo regarded DiMucci as being a \"hip, with-it musician father\", giving calm, sage, non-judgmental advice to his children and loving them unconditionally. During the party, DiMucci demonstrated and reinforced the interaction with his children, and inspired Reo to him to his family dynamic for a pilot in which the \"cool\" father would be a highlight.\n\nHowever, just prior to attending the DiMucci party, Reo had toyed with the idea of writing a pilot that depicted a wise-beyond-his-years, introspective teenage boy, modeled closely after protagonist [[Holden Caulfield]] in [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.<ref name=hentges>{{cite web| title=Blossom: Seasons 1 & 2| url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/69362-blossom-seasons-1-2/| last=Hentges| first=Sarah| date=January 26, 2009| work=[[PopMatters]]| accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref> He decided to include both the hip father and Holden Caulfield-esque boy in the new pilot, with the boy eventually becoming the lead character. With Witt and Thomas' support of the storyline, Reo pitched the project to NBC in 1989 under the title ''Richie''. Reo had the utmost faith in NBC agreeing to the format as it was, and believed that the unique characters would transform family sitcoms if it became a series. NBC liked the screenplay, but ordered changes to the format. Network executives told Reo and Witt/Thomas that they wanted to see the lead character go from being the Holden Caulfield-like Richie to that of his older sister, Blossom, and that the girl should have Richie's character traits instead. At the same time, NBC felt that the combination of such an emotionally intuitive child and a super-chic father was too radical to put on the air, so they urged Reo and Witt/Thomas to give Blossom and her siblings nuclear, conservative parents.\n\nIn the ''Blossom'' series finale, the titular character records a new entry into her video diary, in which she discusses the changes happening in her life post-high school. As she also examines how much she has grown since her first video diary entry at the beginning of the series, Blossom describes herself as \"a teenage Holden Caulfield\". Reo wrote the finale with series producer Judith D. Allison, and thus decided to make an allusion to the inspiration of the lead character.\n\n===Pilot episode===\nAt the time Mayim Bialik signed on for the pilot, she had recently worked on another sitcom project for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], entitled ''[[Molloy (TV series)|Molloy]]''. Both NBC, which had bought the ''Blossom'' pilot, and Fox were planning to broadcast both Bialik projects in 1990, with either of the two set to continue as a regular series beyond its preview/tryout run, depending on which was more successful. The pilot episode of ''Blossom'' was taped in the spring of 1990, and was the first of the projects to air, with NBC broadcasting the pilot as a special on July 5, 1990. Four weeks later, Fox commenced a seven-episode tryout run for ''Molloy'', whose episodes had been produced in 1989, prior to Bialik signing on for the NBC pilot. ''Molloy'' faced low ratings, and Fox canceled the series after the seven-episode order completed. NBC executives, who had been pleased with the ratings of the Bialik pilot special, ordered ''Blossom'' as a midseason replacement for January 1991.\n\nIn the pilot, Blossom Russo lived with both her parents, in a more conservative, nuclear household. Her father was played by [[Richard Masur]], and was named Terry Russo; [[Barrie Youngfellow]] (fresh off ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'', another Witt/Thomas production) played Blossom's mother, named Barbara Russo. All other cast members were present in the pilot, all with their familiar character names, except for Joey Lawrence's character whose name was Donny Russo. Tony was going through his first drug/alcohol rehab period (in which Terry remarked that \"he had a serious problem--he missed all of 1989\"), and had his own separate scene with Blossom in the kitchen, late at night, as he gave her sage anecdotes about their lives. Neither of Blossom's parents had musical careers in the pilot, with Terry working as an accountant and Barbara working as a finance consultant. (Coincidentally, Youngfellow's ''It's a Living'' co-star [[Gail Edwards]] would later be a recurring guest star during the series' run, as Six's mother, Sharon LeMeure).\n\nThe original subject of divorce, was carried out differently after the pilot, involved Blossom suspecting that her parents were having marriage troubles.<ref name=paskin>{{cite web|title=Full Bloom|author=Paskin, Willa|date=July 28, 2014|url=https://slate.com/culture/2014/07/blossom-reruns-on-hub-mayim-bialiks-sitcom-was-wise-beyond-its-years.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]]}}</ref> Blossom confides in Six about the fights and discussions she overheard them having, which is followed by Terry and Barbara's announcement over dinner that they were going to meet with an attorney friend. Blossom's fears continue to grow until her parents reveal that they were only having their wills drawn up. Notable guest stars in the pilot included [[Debra Sandlund]] as Terry's secretary and [[Justin Whalin]] as William Zimmerman, a boy at school who wishes to go steady with Blossom.\n\nThe original theme music in the pilot was [[Bobby Brown]]'s 1988 hit single \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which was featured over the first season opening credits format of Blossom dancing in her bedroom, as she taped herself on home video. Between production of the pilot and regular series, the producers hired [[Dr. John]] (who had sung a cover of the standard \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive|Accentuate the Positive]]\" as the theme for Bialik's other series, ''Molloy'') to perform the replacement theme, \"My Opinionation\". The title sequence was re-shot so that Bialik's dancing was more in sync with \"My Opinionation\". In syndicated reruns of the ''Blossom'' pilot, \"My Opinionation\" is used for the opening sequence, with Bialik's dancing (originally to \"My Prerogative\") noticeably out-of-sync with the song.\n\nSoon after NBC picked up ''Blossom'' as a regular series, Reo successfully convinced programming chief [[Brandon Tartikoff]] and his executives to allow the lead character to have the chic, divorced musician father he had originally envisioned for the project. Masur and Youngfellow were dismissed and Witt and Thomas then convinced Ted Wass, who had previously starred on their 1970s sitcom ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', to portray Blossom's single dad Nick Russo, on Wass' condition that he could also direct numerous episodes. Mayim Bialik claimed to have had influence in Wass' casting, as she enjoyed auditioning with him the most out of other actors who were trying out when the role was being recast. Earlier, before the pilot was shot, Bialik had single-handedly been responsible for Michael Stoyanov joining the project, after she had seen him as a guest star on sister series ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]''. Not only did Bialik enjoy watching Stoyanov, but she also felt they shared a strong physical resemblance, and that they would be believable as brother and sister.\n\n==Production==\nFive seasons of ''Blossom'' were produced, with a total of 114 episodes.\n\n[[Bill Bixby]] became a frequent director on the series in its third season, a role he continued for several episodes into the fourth, despite his ongoing battle with [[prostate cancer]]. On November 15, 1993, shortly after learning that his illness was terminal, Bixby collapsed on the ''Blossom'' set and was hospitalized. He died six days later.<ref>{{cite news| title=Bill Bixby, Star of TV's 'Incredible Hulk,' Dies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-23-me-60008-story.html|author=Oliver, Myrna|date=November 23, 1993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|accessdate=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Opening sequences===\nThe theme song was \"My Opinionation\" by [[Mike Post]] and Steve Geyer and performed by recording artist Dr. John.<ref name=brooks/> The opening sequence featured Blossom filming herself in her bedroom on home video dancing, performing aerobics, making silly faces, pretending to talk on the phone, etc.\n\nSeason two switched exclusively to a sequence of dance moves by the title character, this time on film and in front of a pastel blue/pink background. Blossom's outfit changed in each dancing scene, and a variety of dance moves were performed, from [[belly dancing]] to [[voguing]]. The second season added Barnard Hughes to the show and opening credits, under the \"With\" heading, preceding Ted Wass.\n\nIn the third season, the dancing concept was expanded upon in the opening sequence. Core cast members Lawrence, Stoyanov, von O\u00ff and Wass joined Bialik as she danced. They each appeared one at a time as their credit was shown around Blossom's dancing. With Barnard Hughes relegated to recurring status on the show, his name no longer appeared in the opening credits, but Portia Dawson and David Lascher's names were added (despite their not being physically present in the sequence). This version of the intro lasted through the end of season four. Also beginning in season three, most segments of the show opened and closed with the first frame of a scene being frozen in a multi-colored watercolor effect. The watercolor stills lasted through the end of the series.\n\nThe fifth and final season dropped a full-fledged intro, instead displaying the ''Blossom'' logo over the watercolor effect that opened and closed segments, while a short piano remix of the first few notes of \"My Opinionation\" played to open the show. The opening credits ran over the prologue of the episode. During the 1994-95 season, NBC began running its credits in the squeeze-screen format.<ref name=johnson/>\n\n==Crossovers==\nBecause ''Blossom'' aired immediately after ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' on NBC for a period, NBC cross-promoted the shows on two occasions. [[Will Smith]] appeared in \"I'm With The Band\" as himself under his rap stage name, [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]], and later that season, [[Karyn Parsons]] made an appearance on the show in \"Wake Up Little Suzy\" as her ''Fresh Prince'' character, Hilary Banks.\n[[Estelle Getty]] appeared in one episode as [[Sophia Petrillo]], her character from ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest]]''.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Blossom episodes}}\n{{:List of Blossom episodes}}\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n{{Television season ratings\n| hide_18_49_rating = y\n| hide_18_49_rank   = y\n\n|link1            = List of Blossom episodes#Season 1 (1990\u201391)\n|timeslot1        = Monday 8:30 p.m.\n|timeslot_length1 = 5\n|episodes1        = 13\n|start1           = {{Start date|1991|1|03}}\n|end1             = {{End date|1991|4|29}}\n|season1          = 1990\u201391\n|rank1            = 44\n|viewers1         = 11.284\n<!-- | 18_49_rating1    = NUMBERS -->\n\n|link2     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 2 (1991\u201392)\n|episodes2 = 24\n|start2    = {{Start date|1991|9|16}}\n|end2      = {{End date|1992|5|04}}\n|season2   = 1991\u201392\n|rank2     = 34\n|viewers2  = 12.075\n\n|link3     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 3 (1992\u201393)\n|episodes3 = 26\n|start3    = {{Start date|1992|8|10}}\n|end3      = {{End date|1993|5|17}}\n|season3   = 1992\u201393\n|rank3     = 27\n|viewers3  = 12.569\n\n|link4     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 4 (1993\u201394)\n|episodes4 = 28\n|start4    = {{Start date|1993|9|19}}\n|end4      = {{End date|1994|5|23}} \n|season4   = 1993\u201394\n|rank4      = 32\n|viewers4   = 12.520\n\n|link5      = List of Blossom episodes#Season 5 (1994\u201395)\n|episodes5  = 22\n|start5     = {{Start date|1994|9|26}}\n|end5       = {{End date|1995|5|22}}\n|season5    = 1994\u201395\n|rank5      = 55\n|viewers5   = 9.922\n}}\n\n==Syndication==\n[[Rerun]]s of ''Blossom'' were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] in the 1995, including on [[WGN America|Superstation WGN]] and [[Discovery Family]].\n\n*Atlanta: WUPA 69\n*Austin: KNVA 54\n*Beaumont: KBTV 4\n*Birmingham: 6, WTTO 21, WGWW 40\n*Boston: WSBK 38\n*Bryan: KBTX 3\n*Chicago: WGN 9\n*Cincinnati: WSTR 64\n*Cleveland: WBNX 55\n*Dallas: KTVT 11\n*Dayton: WBDT 26\n*Denver: KWGN 2\n*Detroit: WKBD 50\n*Fresno: KMPH 26\n*Green bay: WIWB 14\n*Houston: KIAH 39\n*Kansas City, Missouri: KSMO 62\n*Los Angeles: KTLA 5\n*Miami: WBFS 33\n*Milwaukee: WVTV 18\n*New Orelans: WVUE 8\n*New York City: WPIX 11\n*Orlando: WOFL 35\n*Philadelphia: WPHL 17\n*Phoenix: KASW 61\n*Portsmouth: WGNT 27\n*Portland, Maine: WPXT 51\n*Portland, Oregon: KPDX 49\n*Richmond, Virginia: WVRN 63\n*Sacramento, California: KMAX 31\n*Seattle: KTZZ 22\n*St. Ant: KABB 29\n*St. Francisco: KOFY 20\n*St. Louis: KDNL 30\n*Tampa: WTMV 32\n*Washington, DC: WDCA 20, WFTY 50\n\n==Home media==\nOn January 27, 2009, [[Shout!

It began with Blossom's mother having left the family to pursue her own life and career, and focused on the family's attempts to adjust. Blossom's father, Nick, an overprotective, somewhat conservative session musician who was frequently between gigs and tours,  was played by [[Ted Wass (actor)|Ted Wass]]. Her older brother Tony ([[Michael Stoyanov]]) was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who eventually became a paramedic. Joey ([[Joey Lawrence]]), the middle child (called Donnie in the pilot), was a stereotypical \"[[Jock (subculture)|dumb jock]]\", known for the drawn-out delivery of his catchphrase \"Whoa!\" Blossom frequently received advice in fantasy scenes, from celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[David Spade]], [[ALF (TV series)|ALF]], [[Will Smith]], and [[God]] (played by [[Don Novello]]). Blossom's mother, Maddy Russo, was played by [[Melissa Manchester]].\n\nBlossom's best friend Six Lemeure ([[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) also played a significant part in her life. Six, an especially fast talker, was best known for her tendency to ramble.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Blossom Ruby Russo''' (played by [[Mayim Bialik]]) \u2013 The youngest child and only daughter of Nick and Maddy Russo,<ref name=weinstein/> best friend of Six, and longtime on-again off-again girlfriend of Vinnie. Blossom learns many hard lessons from the lives of herself, her family and Six, including about abuse, alcohol, drugs, divorce, and many more. Blossom is especially close to her family (including maternal grandfather, Buzz) and develops a strong relationship with her father and two brothers (partially due to the abandonment of her mother). In later seasons, after Nick remarries, Blossom resents but eventually grows to respect her stepmother Carol and new step-sister, Kennedy. In one episode, Blossom learns from Nick that she was named after jazz singer [[Blossom Dearie]].\n*'''Joseph \"Joey\" Russo''' (played by [[Joey Lawrence]] as a teenager, [[Matthew Lawrence]] at age 11, [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] at age 2) \u2013 A not-so-smart baseball player, ladies' man and middle child. Joey once questions his paternity after believing that there was a mix up at the hospital at the time of his birth (with Blossom and Tony joking that he lacks the Russo \"nose\"). He can be sweet and smart when he can put in effort. Despite his dopiness, Joey gets accepted to [[Arizona State University]], but decides to play professional baseball after graduating from high school. His catch phrase is \"Whoa!\"  \n*'''Anthony \"Tony\" Russo''' (played by [[Michael Stoyanov]]) \u2013 A recovering drug addict and alcoholic, he has difficulty remembering four years of his life, but still remembers his addictions well enough to warn Joey and Blossom of what happened, marijuana and alcohol having been crutches for his pressures of school life and their parents' separation .<ref name=bernstein/> He worked at a doughnut shop for a while before becoming a [[paramedic]]. He is extremely close to Blossom, who often comes to him for advice. He has a long term relationship with a Playboy bunny, Rhonda, but later marries Shelly in [[Las Vegas]], after a night of debauchery. Despite the suddenness of their wedding, they decide to give the relationship a try and ultimately decide to stay together. Tony and Shelly welcome a son, Nash Metropolitan Russo, into the world in November 1994. In a crossover with ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', Hilary Banks went on a date with Tony after winning a charity auction. The character was named after the show's executive producer [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]].\n*'''Nicholas \"Nick\" Russo''' (played by [[Ted Wass (actor)|Ted Wass]]) \u2013 The father of Blossom, Joey and Tony. The main caregiver for his three children after his wife, Maddy, leaves the family. He works as a piano player, playing various gigs with a wide range of bands. He and Carol eventually get married, making him the stepfather to Carol's daughter, Kennedy, and he later becomes the grandfather to Tony's child. Nick also treats Blossom's friend, Six, as his own daughter. Because of Tony's alcoholism and drug addiction, he has become overprotective of Joey and Blossom, and has developed a somewhat conservative attitude to parenting. In the pilot, the father was named Terry Russo (played by [[Richard Masur]]), who worked as an [[accountant]].\n*'''Six Dorothy Lemeure''' (played by [[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) \u2013 Blossom's best friend who has a crush on Joey. Her parents are divorced. In the pilot, she alludes to the fact that she was named Six because of the number of beers her father drank in order to get her mother pregnant. A later explanation is that she was the sixth child in her family, although none of her siblings are ever seen. Six goes through many hard times including becoming an alcoholic, dating a married older man, and a pregnancy scare. She thinks of the Russo family as her own family and talks rapidly when she is happy, angry, or nervous. Producers originally offered the role to [[Melissa Joan Hart]], who declined and took the lead role on ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' instead.<ref name=gonzalez>{{cite journal| url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/07/12/melissa-joan-hart-explains-it-all/| title=Melissa Joan Hart 'Explains It All' to EW, including how 'Melissa & Joey' is racier than you think| work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]| last=Gonzalez| first=Sandra| date=July 12, 2011| accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref> Von O\u00ff is credited in the pilot's opening sequence, but for the first season was moved to the closing credits as a \"guest star\". Between the shooting of the ''Blossom'' pilot and its pick-up as a regular series, von O\u00ff had earned a part on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Lenny (TV series)|Lenny]]'' (also from Witt/Thomas and Don Reo). With the cancellation of ''Lenny'' by March 1991, von O\u00ff had reclaimed her originally intended status as a regular ''Blossom'' cast member and in season two moved back to the opening credits.\n*'''Vincent \"Vinnie\" Bonitardi''' (played by [[David Lascher]]) \u2013 Blossom's on-again, off-again boyfriend. Nick does not always like him, but their relationship improves over time. Vinnie gets along with Blossom's family for the most part and though he projects a tough-guy image, can be quite sweet at times.\n*'''Rhonda Jo Applegate''' (played by [[Portia Dawson]]) \u2013 Tony's former on-again, off-again girlfriend. Rhonda is a pin-up model on whom Joey also has a crush.\n*'''Buzz Richman''' (played by [[Barnard Hughes]]) \u2013 Father of Maddy and grandfather of Blossom, Joey, and Tony. Buzz is a war veteran and has been married multiple times, but Ruby was his first and Maddy's mother.

The genesis of the project that eventually became ''Blossom'' occurred soon after Reo's association with Witt and Thomas began, and coincided with another series they were bringing to CBS in 1989, ''[[Heartland (1989 TV series)|Heartland]]''. The project that would be ''Blossom'' had two sources of inspiration. The creation process was born when Reo attended a family party thrown by his long-time friend [[Dion DiMucci]], the lead singer of [[Dion and the Belmonts]]. Reo regarded DiMucci as being a \"hip, with-it musician father\", giving calm, sage, non-judgmental advice to his children and loving them unconditionally. During the party, DiMucci demonstrated and reinforced the interaction with his children, and inspired Reo to him to his family dynamic for a pilot in which the \"cool\" father would be a highlight.\n\nHowever, just prior to attending the DiMucci party, Reo had toyed with the idea of writing a pilot that depicted a wise-beyond-his-years, introspective teenage boy, modeled closely after protagonist [[Holden Caulfield]] in [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.<ref name=hentges>{{cite web| title=Blossom: Seasons 1 & 2| url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/69362-blossom-seasons-1-2/| last=Hentges| first=Sarah| date=January 26, 2009| work=[[PopMatters]]| accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref> He decided to include both the hip father and Holden Caulfield-esque boy in the new pilot, with the boy eventually becoming the lead character. With Witt and Thomas' support of the storyline, Reo pitched the project to NBC in 1989 under the title ''Richie''. Reo had the utmost faith in NBC agreeing to the format as it was, and believed that the unique characters would transform family sitcoms if it became a series. NBC liked the screenplay, but ordered changes to the format. Network executives told Reo and Witt/Thomas that they wanted to see the lead character go from being the Holden Caulfield-like Richie to that of his older sister, Blossom, and that the girl should have Richie's character traits instead. At the same time, NBC felt that the combination of such an emotionally intuitive child and a super-chic father was too radical to put on the air, so they urged Reo and Witt/Thomas to give Blossom and her siblings nuclear, conservative parents.\n\nIn the ''Blossom'' series finale, the titular character records a new entry into her video diary, in which she discusses the changes happening in her life post-high school. As she also examines how much she has grown since her first video diary entry at the beginning of the series, Blossom describes herself as \"a teenage Holden Caulfield\". Reo wrote the finale with series producer Judith D. Allison, and thus decided to make an allusion to the inspiration of the lead character.\n\n===Pilot episode===\nAt the time Mayim Bialik signed on for the pilot, she had recently worked on another sitcom project for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], entitled ''[[Molloy (TV series)|Molloy]]''. Both NBC, which had bought the ''Blossom'' pilot, and Fox were planning to broadcast both Bialik projects in 1990, with either of the two set to continue as a regular series beyond its preview/tryout run, depending on which was more successful. The pilot episode of ''Blossom'' was taped in the spring of 1990, and was the first of the projects to air, with NBC broadcasting the pilot as a special on July 5, 1990. Four weeks later, Fox commenced a seven-episode tryout run for ''Molloy'', whose episodes had been produced in 1989, prior to Bialik signing on for the NBC pilot. ''Molloy'' faced low ratings, and Fox canceled the series after the seven-episode order completed. NBC executives, who had been pleased with the ratings of the Bialik pilot special, ordered ''Blossom'' as a midseason replacement for January 1991.\n\nIn the pilot, Blossom Russo lived with both her parents, in a more conservative, nuclear household. Her father was played by [[Richard Masur]], and was named Terry Russo; [[Barrie Youngfellow]] (fresh off ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'', another Witt/Thomas production) played Blossom's mother, named Barbara Russo. All other cast members were present in the pilot, all with their familiar character names, except for Joey Lawrence's character whose name was Donny Russo. Tony was going through his first drug/alcohol rehab period (in which Terry remarked that \"he had a serious problem--he missed all of 1989\"), and had his own separate scene with Blossom in the kitchen, late at night, as he gave her sage anecdotes about their lives. Neither of Blossom's parents had musical careers in the pilot, with Terry working as an accountant and Barbara working as a finance consultant. (Coincidentally, Youngfellow's ''It's a Living'' co-star [[Gail Edwards]] would later be a recurring guest star during the series' run, as Six's mother, Sharon LeMeure).\n\nThe original subject of divorce, was carried out differently after the pilot, involved Blossom suspecting that her parents were having marriage troubles.<ref name=paskin>{{cite web|title=Full Bloom|author=Paskin, Willa|date=July 28, 2014|url=https://slate.com/culture/2014/07/blossom-reruns-on-hub-mayim-bialiks-sitcom-was-wise-beyond-its-years.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]]}}</ref> Blossom confides in Six about the fights and discussions she overheard them having, which is followed by Terry and Barbara's announcement over dinner that they were going to meet with an attorney friend. Blossom's fears continue to grow until her parents reveal that they were only having their wills drawn up. Notable guest stars in the pilot included [[Debra Sandlund]] as Terry's secretary and [[Justin Whalin]] as William Zimmerman, a boy at school who wishes to go steady with Blossom.\n\nThe original theme music in the pilot was [[Bobby Brown]]'s 1988 hit single \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which was featured over the first season opening credits format of Blossom dancing in her bedroom, as she taped herself on home video. Between production of the pilot and regular series, the producers hired [[Dr. John]] (who had sung a cover of the standard \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive|Accentuate the Positive]]\" as the theme for Bialik's other series, ''Molloy'') to perform the replacement theme, \"My Opinionation\". The title sequence was re-shot so that Bialik's dancing was more in sync with \"My Opinionation\". In syndicated reruns of the ''Blossom'' pilot, \"My Opinionation\" is used for the opening sequence, with Bialik's dancing (originally to \"My Prerogative\") noticeably out-of-sync with the song.\n\nSoon after NBC picked up ''Blossom'' as a regular series, Reo successfully convinced programming chief [[Brandon Tartikoff]] and his executives to allow the lead character to have the chic, divorced musician father he had originally envisioned for the project. Masur and Youngfellow were dismissed and Witt and Thomas then convinced Ted Wass, who had previously starred on their 1970s sitcom ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', to portray Blossom's single dad Nick Russo, on Wass' condition that he could also direct numerous episodes. Mayim Bialik claimed to have had influence in Wass' casting, as she enjoyed auditioning with him the most out of other actors who were trying out when the role was being recast. Earlier, before the pilot was shot, Bialik had single-handedly been responsible for Michael Stoyanov joining the project, after she had seen him as a guest star on sister series ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]''. Not only did Bialik enjoy watching Stoyanov, but she also felt they shared a strong physical resemblance, and that they would be believable as brother and sister.\n\n==Production==\nFive seasons of ''Blossom'' were produced, with a total of 114 episodes.\n\n[[Bill Bixby]] became a frequent director on the series in its third season, a role he continued for several episodes into the fourth, despite his ongoing battle with [[prostate cancer]]. On November 15, 1993, shortly after learning that his illness was terminal, Bixby collapsed on the ''Blossom'' set and was hospitalized. He died six days later.<ref>{{cite news| title=Bill Bixby, Star of TV's 'Incredible Hulk,' Dies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-23-me-60008-story.html|author=Oliver, Myrna|date=November 23, 1993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|accessdate=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Opening sequences===\nThe theme song was \"My Opinionation\" by [[Mike Post]] and Steve Geyer and performed by recording artist Dr. John.<ref name=brooks/> The opening sequence featured Blossom filming herself in her bedroom on home video dancing, performing aerobics, making silly faces, pretending to talk on the phone, etc.\n\nSeason two switched exclusively to a sequence of dance moves by the title character, this time on film and in front of a pastel blue/pink background. Blossom's outfit changed in each dancing scene, and a variety of dance moves were performed, from [[belly dancing]] to [[voguing]]. The second season added Barnard Hughes to the show and opening credits, under the \"With\" heading, preceding Ted Wass.\n\nIn the third season, the dancing concept was expanded upon in the opening sequence. Core cast members Lawrence, Stoyanov, von O\u00ff and Wass joined Bialik as she danced. They each appeared one at a time as their credit was shown around Blossom's dancing. With Barnard Hughes relegated to recurring status on the show, his name no longer appeared in the opening credits, but Portia Dawson and David Lascher's names were added (despite their not being physically present in the sequence). This version of the intro lasted through the end of season four. Also beginning in season three, most segments of the show opened and closed with the first frame of a scene being frozen in a multi-colored watercolor effect. The watercolor stills lasted through the end of the series.\n\nThe fifth and final season dropped a full-fledged intro, instead displaying the ''Blossom'' logo over the watercolor effect that opened and closed segments, while a short piano remix of the first few notes of \"My Opinionation\" played to open the show. The opening credits ran over the prologue of the episode. During the 1994-95 season, NBC began running its credits in the squeeze-screen format.<ref name=johnson/>\n\n==Crossovers==\nBecause ''Blossom'' aired immediately after ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' on NBC for a period, NBC cross-promoted the shows on two occasions. [[Will Smith]] appeared in \"I'm With The Band\" as himself under his rap stage name, [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]], and later that season, [[Karyn Parsons]] made an appearance on the show in \"Wake Up Little Suzy\" as her ''Fresh Prince'' character, Hilary Banks.\n[[Estelle Getty]] appeared in one episode as [[Sophia Petrillo]], her character from ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest]]''.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Blossom episodes}}\n{{:List of Blossom episodes}}\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n{{Television season ratings\n| hide_18_49_rating     = y\n\n|link1            = List of Blossom episodes#Season 1 (1990\u201391)\n|timeslot1        = Monday 8:30 p.m.\n|timeslot_length1 = 5\n|episodes1        = 13\n|start1           = {{Start date|1991|1|03}}\n|end1             = {{End date|1991|4|29}}\n|season1          = 1990\u201391\n|rank1            = 44\n|viewers1         = 11.284\n<!-- | 18_49_rating1    = NUMBERS -->\n\n|link2     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 2 (1991\u201392)\n|episodes2 = 24\n|start2    = {{Start date|1991|9|16}}\n|end2      = {{End date|1992|5|04}}\n|season2   = 1991\u201392\n|rank2     = 34\n|viewers2  = 12.075\n\n|link3     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 3 (1992\u201393)\n|episodes3 = 26\n|start3    = {{Start date|1992|8|10}}\n|end3      = {{End date|1993|5|17}}\n|season3   = 1992\u201393\n|rank3     = 27\n|viewers3  = 12.569\n\n|link4     = List of Blossom episodes#Season 4 (1993\u201394)\n|episodes4 = 28\n|start4    = {{Start date|1993|9|19}}\n|end4      = {{End date|1994|5|23}} \n|season4   = 1993\u201394\n|rank4      = 32\n|viewers4   = 12.520\n\n|link5      = List of Blossom episodes#Season 5 (1994\u201395)\n|episodes5  = 22\n|start5     = {{Start date|1994|9|26}}\n|end5       = {{End date|1995|5|22}}\n|season5    = 1994\u201395\n|rank5      = 55\n|viewers5   = 9.922\n}}\n\n==Syndication==\n[[Rerun]]s of ''Blossom'' were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] in the 1995, including on [[WGN America|Superstation WGN]] and [[Discovery Family]].\n\n*Atlanta: WUPA 69\n*Austin: KNVA 54\n*Beaumont: KBTV 4\n*Birmingham: 6, WTTO 21, WGWW 40\n*Boston: WSBK 38\n*Bryan: KBTX 3\n*Chicago: WGN 9\n*Cincinnati: WSTR 64\n*Cleveland: WBNX 55\n*Dallas: KTVT 11\n*Dayton: WBDT 26\n*Denver: KWGN 2\n*Detroit: WKBD 50\n*Fresno: KMPH 26\n*Green bay: WIWB 14\n*Houston: KIAH 39\n*Kansas City, Missouri: KSMO 62\n*Los Angeles: KTLA 5\n*Miami: WBFS 33\n*Milwaukee: WVTV 18\n*New Orelans: WVUE 8\n*New York City: WPIX 11\n*Orlando: WOFL 35\n*Philadelphia: WPHL 17\n*Phoenix: KASW 61\n*Portsmouth: WGNT 27\n*Portland, Maine: WPXT 51\n*Portland, Oregon: KPDX 49\n*Richmond, Virginia: WVRN 63\n*Sacramento, California: KMAX 31\n*Seattle: KTZZ 22\n*St. Ant: KABB 29\n*St. Francisco: KOFY 20\n*St. Louis: KDNL 30\n*Tampa: WTMV 32\n*Washington, DC: WDCA 20, WFTY 50\n\n==Home media==\nOn January 27, 2009, [[Shout!
