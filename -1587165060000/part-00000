In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to [[California]] and [[Labrador]] and south to [[Chile]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In the 17th century, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] explorers conquered [[Siberia]] in search of sables, while the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] contributed greatly to the charting of [[Australia]]. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Oceania]] and the discovery of [[Alaska]], while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the [[polar region]]s and excursions into the heart of Africa. By the early 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.\n\nhihihihihiihihihiihihihihhihiihihihiihiihihi\n\n==16th century==\n[[File:Nau de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|alt=An old painting depicting a wooden sailing ship with sails full blown by the wind|Cabral's ship on the fleet that sighted the Brazilian mainland for the first time on 22 April 1500.

In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to [[California]] and [[Labrador]] and south to [[Chile]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In the 17th century, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] explorers conquered [[Siberia]] in search of sables, while the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] contributed greatly to the charting of [[Australia]]. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Oceania]] and the discovery of [[Alaska]], while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the [[polar region]]s and excursions into the heart of Africa. By the early 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.\n\n==15th century==\n[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|[[Vasco da Gama]] lands at [[Calicut]], illustration for Os Lus\u00edadas, 1880 by Ernesto Casanova]]\n*1418 \u2013 [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] and [[Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira]] discover [[Porto Santo Island]] in the [[Madeira Islands|Madeira archipelago]].<ref name=Diffie>{{cite book| last = Diffie| first = Bailey| title = Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415\u20131580| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| year = 1977| isbn = 0-8166-0782-6| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&lpg=1| pages = 465\u2013474}}</ref>\n*1419 \u2013 [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco|Gon\u00e7alves]] and Vaz discover the main island of [[Madeira Island|Madeira]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1431 \u2013 [[Diogo de Silves]] discovers the [[Azores]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1434 \u2013 [[Gil Eanes]] passes [[Cape Chaunar|Cabo de N\u00e3o]] and becomes the first to sail beyond [[Cape Bojador]] and return alive.<ref name=Morison1974>{{cite book| last = Morison| first = Samuel| title = The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492\u20131616| url = https://archive.org/details/europeandiscover00mori| url-access = registration| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1974| location = New York}}</ref>\n*1444 \u2013 [[Dinis Dias]] reaches the mouth of the [[Senegal River]].<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1446 \u2013 The Portuguese reach the mainland peninsula of [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] and the [[Gambia River]].<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1456 \u2013 [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] explore the [[Cape Verde Islands]], {{convert|560|km}} west of the Cape Verde peninsula.<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1460 \u2013 [[P\u00earo de Sintra]] reaches [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1470 \u2013 [[Cape Palmas]] is passed.<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1472 \u2013 [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]] discovers the island of [[Bioko]].<ref name=Ravenstein>{{cite book| last = Ravenstein| first = Ernest George| title = The voyages of Diogo C\u00e3o and Bartholomeu Dias, 1482\u201388| publisher = W.

Largely considered her come-back album, Carey's tenth studio effort ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005) revived faith in the singer's stock, with single \"[[We Belong Together]]\" becoming her strongest international showing in years, and topping the chart in the US for 14-weeks and breaking several radio airplay records.

Five F-1 engines were used in the [[S-IC]] first stage of each Saturn V, which served as the main launch vehicle of the [[Apollo program]]. The F-1 remains the most powerful single [[combustion chamber]] [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine ever developed.<ref>W.

The E-1, although successfully tested in static firing, was quickly seen as a technological dead-end, and was abandoned for the larger, more powerful F-1. The Air Force eventually halted development of the F-1 because of a lack of requirement for such a large engine. However, the recently created [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) appreciated the usefulness of an engine with so much power and contracted Rocketdyne to complete its development. Test firings of F-1 components had been performed as early as 1957. The first static firing of a full-stage developmental F-1 was performed in March 1959. The first F-1 was delivered to NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] in October 1963. In December 1964, the F-1 completed flight rating tests. Testing continued at least through 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Background_F-1_Rocket_Engine.pdf |title=NASA Rocketdyne document |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nEarly development tests revealed serious [[combustion instability]] problems which sometimes caused [[catastrophic failure]].<ref>{{Citation\n |first       = Renea\n |last        = Ellison\n |first2      = Marlow\n |last2       = Moser\n |title       = Combustion Instability Analysis and the Effects of Drop Size on Acoustic Driving Rocket Flow\n |place       = Huntsville, Alabama\n |publisher   = Propulsion Research Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville\n |url         = http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907050809/http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-07\n}}</ref> Initially, progress on this problem was slow, as it was intermittent and unpredictable. Oscillations of 4&nbsp;kHz with harmonics to 24&nbsp;kHz were observed. Eventually, engineers developed a diagnostic technique of detonating small explosive charges (which they called \"bombs\") outside the combustion chamber, through a tangential tube (RDX, C4 or black powder were used) while the engine was firing. This allowed them to determine exactly how the running chamber responded to variations in pressure, and to determine how to nullify these oscillations. The designers could then quickly experiment with different co-axial fuel-injector designs to obtain the one most resistant to instability. These problems were addressed from 1959 through 1961. Eventually, engine combustion was so stable, it would [[Damping ratio|self-damp]] artificially induced instability within one-tenth of a second.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SaturnF1EngineDiagram.png|thumb|right|F-1 rocket engine components]]\n\nThe F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle [[Liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engine]] ever flown. The [[M-1 (rocket engine)|M-1 rocket engine]] was designed to have more thrust, but it was only tested at the component level. Also, the [[RD-170]] produces more thrust, but has four nozzles. The F-1 burned [[RP-1]] (rocket grade [[kerosene]]) as the fuel and used [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as the oxidizer. A [[turbopump]] was used to inject fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber. \n\nOne notable challenge in the construction of the F-1 was [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] of the thrust chamber. Chemical engineer Dennis \u201cDan\u201d Brevik was faced with the task of ensuring the preliminary [[combustion chamber]] tube bundle and [[manifold]] design produced by Al Bokstellar would run cool. In essence, Brevik\u2019s job was to \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t melt.\u201d Through Brevik\u2019s calculations of the [[hydrodynamic]] and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] characteristics of the F-1, he and his team were able to fix an issue known as \u2018starvation\u2019. This is when an unbalance of static pressure leads to 'hot spots' in the manifolds. The material used for the F-1 thrust chamber tube bundle, reinforcing bands and manifold was [[Inconel|Inconel-X750]], a refractory nickel based alloy capable of withstanding high temperatures. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387096292|title=The Saturn V F-1 Engine: Powering Apollo into History|last=Young|first=Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Praxis|isbn=978-0-387-09629-2|series=Space Exploration|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe heart of the engine was the thrust chamber, which mixed and burned the fuel and oxidizer to produce thrust. A domed chamber at the top of the engine served as a [[Manifold (general engineering)|manifold]] supplying liquid oxygen to the [[Liquid-propellant rocket#Injectors|injectors]], and also served as a mount for the [[gimbal]] bearing which transmitted the thrust to the body of the rocket. Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the thrust chamber in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion.  Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the thrust chamber \u2014 which formed approximately the upper half of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|exhaust nozzle]] \u2014 and back in order to cool the nozzle.\n\nA [[gas-generator cycle|gas generator]] was used to drive a [[turbine]] which drove separate fuel and oxygen pumps, each feeding the thrust chamber assembly. The turbine was driven at 5,500 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], producing {{convert|55000|bhp|MW}}. The fuel pump delivered {{convert|15,471|gal|l|abbr=off}} of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered {{convert|24,811|gal|l|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen per minute. Environmentally, the turbopump was required to withstand temperatures ranging from input gas at {{convert|1500|F|-1}} to liquid oxygen at {{convert|\u2212300|F|0}}. Structurally, fuel was used to lubricate and cool the turbine [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].\n\n[[File:F-1 Engine Test Firing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Test firing of an F-1 engine at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]]]\nBelow the thrust chamber was the [[nozzle extension]], roughly half the length of the engine. This extension increased the [[Rocket engine#Propellant efficiency|expansion ratio]] of the engine from 10:1 to 16:1.  The exhaust from the turbopump was fed into the nozzle extension by a large, tapered manifold; this relatively cool gas formed a film which protected the nozzle extension from the hot ({{convert|5800|F|-1}}) exhaust gas.<ref name=SVPressKit>{{Citation\n |date= December 1968\n |title= Saturn V News Reference: F-1 Engine Fact Sheet\n |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n |url= http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/F-1_Engine.pdf\n |pages= 3\u20133, 3\u20134\n |accessdate= 2008-06-01\n}}</ref>\n\nEach second, a single F-1 burned {{convert|5683|lb}} of oxidizer and fuel: {{convert|3945|lb|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen and {{convert|1738|lb|abbr=on}} of RP-1, generating {{convert|1500000|lbf|MN tf|abbr=on}} of thrust.

These had to be removed from the engine to avoid problems during engine handling and future firing, and the solvent [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) was used to clean the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing.  The cleaning procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30\u201335 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits.  For some engines, the engine's gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=The Use of Trichloroethylene at NASA's SSFL Sites |accessdate=2013-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001621/http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"ntrs.nasa.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&Ntk=all&Ntx=mode%20matchall&Ntt=19750070175 |title=F-1 Rocket Engine Operating Instructions |publisher=Ntrs.nasa.gov |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>  The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.<ref name=\"ntrs.nasa.gov\"/>\n\n=== Specifications ===\n[[File:F-1 Engines Being Installed.jpg|right|thumb|Installation of F-1 engines to the Saturn V S-IC Stage.

There were small performance variations between engines on a given mission, and variations in average thrust between missions.

The E-1, although successfully tested in static firing, was quickly seen as a technological dead-end, and was abandoned for the larger, more powerful F-1. The Air Force eventually halted development of the F-1 because of a lack of requirement for such a large engine. However, the recently created [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) appreciated the usefulness of an engine with so much power and contracted Rocketdyne to complete its development. Test firings of F-1 components had been performed as early as 1957. The first static firing of a full-stage developmental F-1 was performed in March 1959. The first F-1 was delivered to NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] in October 1963. In December 1964, the F-1 completed flight rating tests. Testing continued at least through 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Background_F-1_Rocket_Engine.pdf |title=NASA Rocketdyne document |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nEarly development tests revealed serious [[combustion instability]] problems which sometimes caused [[catastrophic failure]].<ref>{{Citation\n |first       = Renea\n |last        = Ellison\n |first2      = Marlow\n |last2       = Moser\n |title       = Combustion Instability Analysis and the Effects of Drop Size on Acoustic Driving Rocket Flow\n |place       = Huntsville, Alabama\n |publisher   = Propulsion Research Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville\n |url         = http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907050809/http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-07\n}}</ref> Initially, progress on this problem was slow, as it was intermittent and unpredictable. Oscillations of 4&nbsp;kHz with harmonics to 24&nbsp;kHz were observed. Eventually, engineers developed a diagnostic technique of detonating small explosive charges (which they called \"bombs\") outside the combustion chamber, through a tangential tube (RDX, C4 or black powder were used) while the engine was firing. This allowed them to determine exactly how the running chamber responded to variations in pressure, and to determine how to nullify these oscillations. The designers could then quickly experiment with different co-axial fuel-injector designs to obtain the one most resistant to instability. These problems were addressed from 1959 through 1961. Eventually, engine combustion was so stable, it would [[Damping ratio|self-damp]] artificially induced instability within one-tenth of a second.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SaturnF1EngineDiagram.png|thumb|right|F-1 rocket engine components]]\n\nThe F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle [[Liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engine]] ever flown. The [[M-1 (rocket engine)|M-1 rocket engine]] was designed to have more thrust, but it was only tested at the component level. Also, the [[RD-170]] produces more thrust, but has four nozzles. The F-1 burned [[RP-1]] (rocket grade [[kerosene]]) as the fuel and used [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as the oxidizer. A [[turbopump]] was used to inject fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber. \n\nOne notable challenge in the construction of the F-1 was [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] of the thrust chamber. Chemical engineer Dennis \u201cDan\u201d Brevik was faced with the task of ensuring the preliminary [[combustion chamber]] tube bundle and [[manifold]] design produced by Al Bokstellar would run cool. In essence, Brevik\u2019s job was to \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t melt.\u201d Through Brevik\u2019s calculations of the [[hydrodynamic]] and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] characteristics of the F-1, he and his team were able to fix an issue known as \u2018starvation\u2019. This is when an unbalance of static pressure leads to 'hot spots' in the manifolds. The material used for the F-1 thrust chamber tube bundle, reinforcing bands and manifold was [[Inconel|Inconel-X750]], a refractory nickel based alloy capable of withstanding high temperatures. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387096292|title=The Saturn V F-1 Engine: Powering Apollo into History|last=Young|first=Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Praxis|isbn=978-0-387-09629-2|series=Space Exploration|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe heart of the engine was the thrust chamber, which mixed and burned the fuel and oxidizer to produce thrust. A domed chamber at the top of the engine served as a [[Manifold (general engineering)|manifold]] supplying liquid oxygen to the [[Liquid-propellant rocket#Injectors|injectors]], and also served as a mount for the [[gimbal]] bearing which transmitted the thrust to the body of the rocket. Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the thrust chamber in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion.  Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the thrust chamber \u2014 which formed approximately the upper half of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|exhaust nozzle]] \u2014 and back in order to cool the nozzle.\n\nA [[gas-generator cycle|gas generator]] was used to drive a [[turbine]] which drove separate fuel and oxygen pumps, each feeding the thrust chamber assembly. The turbine was driven at 5,500 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], producing {{convert|55000|bhp|MW}}. The fuel pump delivered {{convert|15,471|gal|l|abbr=off}} of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered {{convert|24,811|gal|l|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen per minute. Environmentally, the turbopump was required to withstand temperatures ranging from input gas at {{convert|1500|F|-1}} to liquid oxygen at {{convert|\u2212300|F|0}}. Structurally, fuel was used to lubricate and cool the turbine [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].\n\n[[File:F-1 Engine Test Firing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Test firing of an F-1 engine at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]]]\nBelow the thrust chamber was the [[nozzle extension]], roughly half the length of the engine. This extension increased the [[Rocket engine#Propellant efficiency|expansion ratio]] of the engine from 10:1 to 16:1.

There were small performance variations between engines on a given mission, and variations in average thrust between missions. For [[Apollo 15]], F-1 performance was:\n\n*Thrust (average, per engine, sea level liftoff): {{convert|1553200|lbf|MN|abbr=on}}\n*Burn time: 159 seconds\n*[[Specific impulse]]: {{convert|264.72|isp|abbr=on}}\n*Mixture ratio: 2.2674\n*[[S-IC]] total sea level liftoff thrust: {{convert|7766000|lbf|MN|abbr=on}}\n\nMeasuring and making comparisons of rocket engine thrust is more complicated than it may first appear.

While outwardly very similar to the F-1, the F-1A produced about 20% greater thrust, {{convert|8|MN|lbf|order=flip|abbr=on}} in tests, and would have been used on future Saturn V vehicles in the post-[[Project Apollo|Apollo]] era.

Sherman]] entered the state from Savannah.\n\nIn early 1865, Taliaferro's men came across an abandoned plantation in western Virginia while retreating from Antebellum, Maryland. The African workers had been shackled and abandoned. Taliaferro ordered his men to release the enslaved and escort them to the Ohio border.<sup>Needs citation</sup>\n\n==Postbellum career==\nAfter the war, Taliaferro lived in Gloucester County.

After the war, Taliaferro entered public life, serving as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and as a prominent backer of [[James Buchanan]]'s presidential campaign in 1856. He also continued his military service as commander of a division of the [[Virginia]] state militia; he commanded at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] following the raid of that town's arsenal by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].\n\n==Civil War==\nTaliaferro became commander of Virginia's state militia following Virginia's secession action on April 17, 1861; indeed, in what might be Virginia's 1st act of aggression of the war, on April 18, 1861, Virginia State Militia Major General Taliaferro was sent to take command at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Later he took command of the [[23rd Virginia Infantry]] as a colonel.

Taliaferro spent the next few months recuperating and resumed division command just before the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December, where he did not see any significant action.\n\nTaliaferro was a strict and aloof commander who alienated many of his troops. There is at least one known circumstance when one of his troops actually assaulted him, though Taliaferro was unscathed. Taliaferro chafed under the command of General Jackson, complaining to his political colleagues in Virginia about Jackson's tactics and treatment of the men. Jackson later protested Taliaferro's promotion to brigadier general, while Taliaferro was still under Jackson's command; however, Jackson respected Taliaferro's leadership and military ability and did not continue to stand in his way.

The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer. \n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].
