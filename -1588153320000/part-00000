It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked.  The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.  Players alternate turns calling \"shots\" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.\n\n''Battleship'' is known worldwide as a [[pencil and paper game]] which dates from [[World War I]]. It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic [[board game]] by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1967.  The game has spawned electronic versions, video games, smart device apps and a [[Battleship (film)|film]].\n\n==History==\nThe game of ''Battleship'' is thought to have its origins in the French game ''[[L'Attaque]]'' played during [[World War I]], although parallels have also been drawn to E. I.

Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's ''Combat: The Battleship Game'', [[Milton Bradley]]'s ''Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy'' and Maurice L. Freedman's ''Warfare Naval Combat''. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called ''Wings'' which pictured planes flying over the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]]. All of these early editions of the game consisted of pre-printed pads of paper.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\n[[File:Flickr - Official U.S. Navy Imagery - Sailors play \"Battleship\" aboard a carrier..jpg|thumb|Players in a ''Battleship'' tournament aboard a U.S. Navy vessel]]\n\nIn 1967 Milton Bradley introduced a version of the game that used plastic boards and pegs. Conceived by Ed Hutchins, play was on pegboards using miniature plastic ships. In 1977, Milton Bradley also released a computerized ''Electronic Battleship'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4122|title=Electronic Battleship|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref> followed in 1989 by ''Electronic Talking Battleship''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4781|title=Electronic Talking Battleship|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref> In 2008, an updated version of ''Battleship'' was released, using hexagonal tiles. In the updated version, each player's board contains several [[island]]s on which \"captured man\" figurines can be placed. Ships may be placed only around the islands, and only in the player's half of the board. When the movie ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' was released, the board game reverted to the original 1967 style. The 2008 updated version is still available as ''Battleship Islands''.\n\n''Battleship'' was one of the earliest games to be produced as a computer game, with a version being released for the [[Compucolor II|Z80 Compucolor]] in 1979.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/><ref>http://titan.apiit.edu.my/pagol/projectinfo.asp?txtID=TP010249{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many computer editions of the game have been produced since. In ''[[Clubhouse Games]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''Battleship'' is known as ''Grid Attack''. It is played on an 8\u00d78 grid, and includes slight variations, such as 4-player gameplay, and various ship sizes and shapes. Versions of ''Battleship'' appear as applications on numerous social networking services.\n\n''Battleship'' was also part of ''[[Hasbro Family Game Night]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Wii]], as well as the [[Xbox 360]] (Xbox Live Arcade). These alter the rules, including the size of the grid (8\u00d712 in the [[NES]] version, 8\u00d78 in the [[Game Boy]] version), size of ships (it is common to feature a submarine that takes up a single square) and special shot missiles for each ship. For example, in the NES version the cruiser has a five-shot missile which strikes five squares in an X pattern on the grid in one turn. Submarine-tracking sonar and aerial [[reconnaissance]] to spot ships are also features.\n\nA [[Family Game Night (TV series)#Battleship|minigame version of ''Battleship'']] was used in the third season of [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]]'s ''[[Family Game Night (TV series)|Family Game Night]]'', which uses a 5\u00d75 grid and the first team to sink three ships wins the game.\n\nIn 2012, the [[military science fiction]] action movie ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' was released, which was inspired by the board game. A version of ''Battleship'' based on the movie was released in which one side had alien ship playing pieces.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Battleships Paper Game.svg|thumb|upright|A typical pen-and-paper version of the game, showing the large \"primary\" grid and the smaller \"tracking\" grid]]\n\nThe game is played on four [[Grid (spatial index)|grids]], two for each player. The grids are typically square \u2013 usually 10\u00d710 \u2013 and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boardgames.about.com/od/salvo/a/rules.htm|title=Salvo - Complete Rules for Battleships Game|publisher=}}</ref> On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records their own shots.\n\nBefore play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. These may vary depending on the  rules.\n\nThe 1990 Milton Bradley version of the rules specify the following ships:<ref name=\"hasbro\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No.\n! Class of ship\n! Size\n|-\n|1\n|[[Aircraft carrier|Carrier]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n|2\n|[[Battleship]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4\n|-\n|3\n|[[Cruiser]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|4\n|[[Submarine]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|5\n|[[Destroyer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|}\n\nIn 2002, Hasbro renamed the Cruiser as ''Destroyer'', taking three squares, and substituted a new two-square ship called the ''Patrol Boat''.<ref>https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/BattleShip_(2002).PDF</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No.\n! Class of ship\n! Size\n|-\n|1\n|[[Aircraft carrier|Carrier]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n|2\n|[[Battleship]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4\n|-\n|3\n|[[Destroyer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|4\n|[[Submarine]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|5\n|[[Patrol boat|Patrol Boat]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|}\n\n\n\nAfter the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. If it is a \"hit\", the player who is hit marks this on their own or \"ocean\" grid (with a red peg in the pegboard version). The attacking player marks the hit or miss on their own \"tracking\" or \"target\" grid with a pencil marking in the paper version of the game, or the appropriate color peg in the pegboard version (red for \"hit\", white for \"miss\"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.\n\nWhen all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the Carrier, Submarine, Cruiser/Destroyer/Patrol Boat, or the titular Battleship. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins. If all ships of both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the 1931 ''Salvo'' edition of the game, players target a specified number of squares at one time, and all of the squares are attacked simultaneously. A player may initially target five (one for each battleship) squares per turn, and this is decreased as ships are lost.<ref name=\"milwaukee\"/> In other variants of this mechanic, the number of shots a player is allowed to fire each turn may either be fixed at five for the whole game, be equal to the number of unsunk ships belonging to the player, or be equal to the size of the player's largest undamaged ship.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> The receiving player may either call the result of each shot in turn, or simply announce, say, \"two hits and three misses\", leaving their opponent to work out the consequences of the salvo.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> In the modern Milton Bradley rules for ''Battleship'', ''Salvo'' is listed as a variation \"for more experienced players\", with the number of shots being equal to the number of ships that the firing player has remaining.<ref name=\"hasbro\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf | title=Battleship Rules | publisher=Hasbro | accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne variant of Battleship allows players to decline to announce that a ship has been sunk, requiring their opponent to take further shots in order to confirm that an area is clear.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> Another house rule allows a player to move one of their ships to a new, uncalled location every fourth or fifth move.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\nAnother variant allows multiple players and allow different shapes for the ships as long as each square of a ship touches at least one other square of that ship.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6U7XKG1Dps</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BattleFleet (game series)|''BattleFleet'' (game series)]]\n* [[Battleship (1993 video game)|''Battleship'' (1993 video game)]]\n* [[Battleship (2012 video game)|''Battleship'' (2012 video game)]]\n* [[Battleship (puzzle)]]\n* [[Battleships (video game)|''Battleships'' (video game)]]\n* ''[[Electronic Battleship: Advanced Mission]]''\n* ''[[Mugwump (game)|Mugwump]]'', a 1973 computer game\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Battleship (game)}}\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/BattleShip_(2002).PDF Battleship Official Hasbro Rules] \u2013 Rulebook insert for ''Battleship'' (2002 version)\n*{{bgg|2425|Battleship}}\n\n{{Hasbro}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battleship (Game)}}\n[[Category:Children's games]]\n[[Category:Paper-and-pencil games]]\n[[Category:Milton Bradley Company games]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in 1931]]\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Guessing games]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Battleship (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Battleship game board.svg|thumb|A map of one player's ships and the hits against them, from a game in progress.

The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. Cardiff Metropolitan University has a number of research and enterprise centres, including the [[Food Industry Centre]], the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research, and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Predecessor institutions===\nIn 1865 the [[Cardiff School of Art]] opened in the [[Old Library, Cardiff|Old Free Library Building]], [[St Mary Street/High Street|St Mary Street]]. The School of Art moved to the Technical Buildings in Dumfries Place in 1900, then The Friary in 1949, then to a new campus in Howard Gardens in 1965.\n\nIn 1940, Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce opened at Crwys Road. The Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce moved to a new Colchester Avenue Campus in 1966, home to management, business, leisure, hospitality, tourism and food students.\n\nIn 1950 Cardiff Training College opened at Heath Park. Llandaff Technical College opened in 1954 at Western Avenue, home to health sciences, design and engineering students. In 1962 the college moved to Cyncoed, now home to the Schools of Education and Sport.\n\n===Merging of the colleges===\nIn 1976, the four colleges merged to form '''South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education'''. The name changed to '''Cardiff Institute of Higher Education''' in 1990, in preparation for Incorporation. In 1992, the Institute joined the University of Wales as an autonomous body.The first Teaching Degree Awarding Powers (TDAPs) were granted by the Privy Council in 1993. The Institute was given the power to award its own degrees in August but placed the powers in abeyance, choosing instead to strengthen their links with the University of Wales. In 1996, it was granted University College status within the University of Wales and named the '''University of Wales Institute, Cardiff''' (UWIC).\n\nIn 2003, UWIC became a constituent institution of the University of Wales.and considered merging with the [[University of Glamorgan]]. 2004 saw the launch of the FE2HE-UWIC Consortium: an FE/HE partnership established with Barry, Bridgend, Coleg Glan Hafren and Ystrad Mynach FE colleges, with [[St David's Catholic College|St David's College]] joining in 2009. Tony Chapman becomes Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales\n\nIn 2005 the university enters into and then ends merger talks with the [[University of Wales, Newport]]. A vote of no confidence is passed by the staff in the Vice Chancellor Tony Chapman. [[London School of Commerce]] became an Associate College in 2006.\n\n[[File:Colchester Ave campus, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|The former Colchester Avenue campus in 2010]]\nIn October 2010, the new building for the Cardiff School of Management opened in Llandaff with the closure of the Colchester Avenue campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwic.ac.uk/csm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222608/http://www.uwic.ac.uk/csm/ |archivedate=14 July 2011  }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130509133819/http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/New-Management-School-officially-unveiled.aspx]</ref> In June 2011, the new Learning Centre on the Llandaff campus was officially opened. Merger talks with Swansea Metropolitan and Trinity St David universities were discussed.\n\n===Split from University of Wales===\nUWIC formally ended its association with the University of Wales, and was renamed Cardiff Metropolitan University in November 2011.<ref name=Namechange /> The university now awards all of its degrees in its own name. Despite this 'withdrawal' from the [[University of Wales]], the new Cardiff Metropolitan University retains close formal links with it.

The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. Cardiff Metropolitan University has a number of research and enterprise centres, including the [[Food Industry Centre]], the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research, and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Predecessor institutions===\nIn 1865 the [[Cardiff School of Art]] opened in the [[Old Library, Cardiff|Old Free Library Building]], [[St Mary Street/High Street|St Mary Street]]. The School of Art moved to the Technical Buildings in Dumfries Place in 1900, then The Friary in 1949, then to a new campus in Howard Gardens in 1965.\n\nIn 1940, Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce opened at Crwys Road. The Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce moved to a new Colchester Avenue Campus in 1966, home to management, business, leisure, hospitality, tourism and food students.\n\nIn 1950 Cardiff Training College opened at Heath Park. Llandaff Technical College opened in 1954 at Western Avenue, home to health sciences, design and engineering students. In 1962 the college moved to Cyncoed, now home to the Schools of Education and Sport.\n\n===Merging of the colleges===\nIn 1976, the four colleges merged to form '''South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education'''. The name changed to '''Cardiff Institute of Higher Education''' in 1990, in preparation for Incorporation. In 1992, the Institute joined the University of Wales as an autonomous body.The first Teaching Degree Awarding Powers (TDAPs) were granted by the Privy Council in 1993. The Institute was given the power to award its own degrees in August but placed the powers in abeyance, choosing instead to strengthen their links with the University of Wales. In 1996, it was granted University College status within the University of Wales and named the '''University of Wales Institute, Cardiff''' (UWIC).\n\nIn 2003, UWIC became a constituent institution of the University of Wales.and considered merging with the [[University of Glamorgan]]. 2004 saw the launch of the FE2HE-UWIC Consortium: an FE/HE partnership established with Barry, Bridgend, Coleg Glan Hafren and Ystrad Mynach FE colleges, with [[St David's Catholic College|St David's College]] joining in 2009. Tony Chapman becomes Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales\n\nIn 2005 the university enters into and then ends merger talks with the [[University of Wales, Newport]]. A vote of no confidence is passed by the staff in the Vice Chancellor Tony Chapman. [[London School of Commerce]] became an Associate College in 2006.\n\n[[File:Colchester Ave campus, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|The former Colchester Avenue campus in 2010]]\nIn October 2010, the new building for the Cardiff School of Management opened in Llandaff with the closure of the Colchester Avenue campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwic.ac.uk/csm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222608/http://www.uwic.ac.uk/csm/ |archivedate=14 July 2011  }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130509133819/http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/New-Management-School-officially-unveiled.aspx]</ref> In June 2011, the new Learning Centre on the Llandaff campus was officially opened.

The peak in the center is a local maximum.]]\n\nIn [[applied mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''local optimum''' of an [[optimization problem]] is a solution that is optimal (either [[maxima and minima|maximal or minimal]]) within a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighboring set]] of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a [[global optimum]], which is the optimal solution among [[solution space|all possible solutions]], not just those in a particular neighborhood of values. \n\n==Continuous domain==\n\nWhen the function to be optimized is [[Continuous function|continuous]], it may be possible to employ [[calculus]] to find local optima. If the [[First derivative test|first derivative]] exists everywhere, it can be equated to zero; if the function has an [[Bounded set|unbounded]] [[Domain of a function|domain]], for a point to be a local optimum it is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] that it satisfy this equation.

The [[Filtering problem (stochastic processes)|filtering problem]] consists of estimating the internal states in [[dynamical systems]] when partial observations are made, and random perturbations are present in the sensors as well as in the dynamical system.

However, these methods do not perform well when applied to very high-dimensional systems.\n\nParticle filters update their prediction in an approximate (statistical) manner. The samples from the distribution are represented by a set of particles; each particle has a likelihood weight assigned to it that represents the probability of that particle being sampled from the probability density function. Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven. Several adaptive resampling criteria can be used, including the variance of the weights and the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1 = Del Moral|first1 = Pierre|last2 = Doucet|first2 = Arnaud|last3 = Jasra|first3 = Ajay|title = On Adaptive Resampling Procedures for Sequential Monte Carlo Methods|journal = Bernoulli|date = 2012|volume = 18|issue = 1|pages = 252\u2013278|url = http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/33/25/83/PDF/RR-6700.pdf|doi = 10.3150/10-bej335}}</ref> In the resampling step, the particles with negligible weights are replaced by new particles in the proximity of the particles with higher weights.\n\nFrom the statistical and probabilistic point of view, particle filters can be interpreted as [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretations of [[Feynman\u2013Kac formula|Feynman-Kac]] probability measures.<ref name=\"dp042\">{{cite book|last = Del Moral|first = Pierre|title = Feynman-Kac formulae.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below). The absolutely continuous assumption on the Markov transitions of <math>X_k</math> are only used to derive in an informal (and rather abusive) way different formulae between posterior distributions using the Bayes' rule for conditional densities.\n\n=== [[Approximate Bayesian computation|Approximate Bayesian Computation models]] ===\nIn some problems, the conditional distribution of the observations given the random states of the signal may fail to have a density or may be impossible or too complex to compute.<ref name=\":PFOBC\"/> In this situation, we need to resort to an additional level of approximation. One strategy is to replace the signal <math>X_k</math> by the Markov chain <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> and to introduce a virtual observation of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal Y_k=Y_k+\\epsilon \\mathcal V_k\\quad\\mbox{for some parameter}\\quad\\epsilon\\in [0,1]</math>\n\nfor some sequence of independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s. The central idea is to observe that\n\n:<math>\\text{Law}\\left(X_k|\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k\\right)\\approx_{\\epsilon\\downarrow 0} \\text{Law}\\left(X_k|Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, Y_k=y_k\\right)</math>\n\nThe particle filter associated with the Markov process <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> given the partial observations <math>\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k,</math> is defined in terms of particles evolving in <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x+d_y}</math> with a likelihood function given with some obvious abusive notation by <math>p(\\mathcal Y_k|\\mathcal X_k)</math>. These probabilistic techniques are closely related to [[Approximate Bayesian Computation]] (ABC). In the context of particle filters, these ABC particle filtering techniques were introduced in 1998 by P. Del Moral, J. Jacod and P.

However, these methods do not perform well when applied to very high-dimensional systems.\n\nParticle filters update their prediction in an approximate (statistical) manner. The samples from the distribution are represented by a set of particles; each particle has a likelihood weight assigned to it that represents the probability of that particle being sampled from the probability density function. Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven.

In [[computational physics]] and [[molecular chemistry]] they are used to solve Feynman-Kac path integration problems, or they compute Boltzmann-Gibbs measures, top eigenvalues and ground states of [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger]] operators. In [[Biology]] and [[Genetics]] they also represent the evolution of a population of individuals or genes in some environment.\n\nThe origins of mean field type evolutionary computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the seminal work of [[Alan Turing]] on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Turing|first1 = Alan M.|title = Computing machinery and intelligence|journal = Mind|volume = LIX|issue = 238|pages = 433\u2013460|doi = 10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433 |date = October 1950}}</ref> and the articles by [[Nils Aall Barricelli]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Barricelli|first = Nils Aall|year = 1954|authorlink = Nils Aall Barricelli|title = Esempi numerici di processi di evoluzione|journal = Methodos|pages = 45\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Barricelli|first = Nils Aall|year = 1957|authorlink = Nils Aall Barricelli|title = Symbiogenetic evolution processes realized by artificial methods|journal = Methodos|pages = 143\u2013182}}</ref> The first trace of particle filters in [[Statistics|statistical methodology]] dates back to the mid-1950s; the 'Poor Man's Monte Carlo',<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Poor Man's Monte Carlo |journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below).

The ''[[stratified sampling]]'' proposed by Kitagawa (1993<ref name=\"Kitagawa1993\"/>) is optimal in terms of variance.\n\nA single step of sequential importance resampling is as follows:\n\n:1) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> draw samples from the ''proposal distribution''\n:: <math>x^{(i)}_k \\sim \\pi(x_k|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k})</math>\n\n:2) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> update the importance weights up to a normalizing constant:\n::<math>\\hat{w}^{(i)}_k = w^{(i)}_{k-1} \\frac{p(y_k|x^{(i)}_k) p(x^{(i)}_k|x^{(i)}_{k-1})} {\\pi(x_k^{(i)}|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k})}.</math>\n: Note that when we use the transition prior probability distribution as the importance function, \n::<math> \\pi(x_k^{(i)}|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k}) = p(x^{(i)}_k|x^{(i)}_{k-1}),</math>\n:this simplifies to the following :\n::<math> \\hat{w}^{(i)}_k = w^{(i)}_{k-1} p(y_k|x^{(i)}_k), </math>\n\n:3) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> compute the normalized importance weights:\n:: <math>w^{(i)}_k = \\frac{\\hat{w}^{(i)}_k}{\\sum_{j=1}^N \\hat{w}^{(j)}_k}</math>\n\n:4) Compute an estimate of the effective number of particles as\n:: <math>\\hat{N}_\\mathit{eff} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(w^{(i)}_k\\right)^2} </math>\n:This criterion reflects the variance of the weights, other criteria can be found in the article,<ref name=\":0\"/> including their rigorous analysis and central limit theorems.\n\n:5) If the effective number of particles is less than a given threshold <math>\\hat{N}_\\mathit{eff} < N_{thr}</math>, then perform resampling:\n::a) Draw ''N'' particles from the current particle set with probabilities proportional to their weights. Replace the current particle set with this new one.\n::b) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> set <math>w^{(i)}_k = 1/N.</math>\n\nThe term ''Sampling Importance Resampling'' is also sometimes used when referring to SIR filters.\n\n=== Sequential importance sampling (SIS) ===\n* Is the same as sequential importance resampling, but without the resampling stage.\n\n=== \"direct version\" algorithm ===\n{{confusing section|date=October 2011}}\nThe \"direct version\" algorithm {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is rather simple (compared to other particle filtering algorithms) and it uses composition and rejection. To generate a single sample ''x'' at ''k'' from <math>p_{x_k|y_{1:k}}(x|y_{1:k})</math>:\n\n:1) Set n=0 (This will count the number of particles generated so far)\n\n:2) [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|Uniformly]] choose an index i from the range <math>\\{1,..., N\\}</math>\n\n:3) Generate a test <math>\\hat{x}</math> from the distribution <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math> with <math> x_{k-1}=x_{k-1|k-1}^{(i)}</math>\n\n:4) Generate the probability of <math>\\hat{y}</math> using <math>\\hat{x}</math> from <math>p(y_k|x_k),~\\mbox{with}~x_k=\\hat{x}</math> where <math>y_k</math> is the measured value\n\n:5) Generate another [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] u from <math>[0, m_k]</math> where <math>m_k = \\sup_{x_k} p(y_k|x_k) </math>\n\n:6) Compare u and <math>p\\left(\\hat{y}\\right)</math>\n\n::6a) If u is larger then repeat from step 2\n\n::6b) If u is smaller then save <math>\\hat{x}</math> as <math>x_{k|k}^{(i)}</math> and increment n\n\n:7) If n == N then quit\n\nThe goal is to generate P \"particles\" at ''k'' using only the particles from <math>k-1</math>. This requires that a Markov equation can be written (and computed) to generate a <math>x_k</math> based only upon <math>x_{k-1}</math>. This algorithm uses composition of the P particles from <math>k-1</math> to generate a particle at ''k'' and repeats (steps 2\u20136) until P particles are generated at ''k''.\n\nThis can be more easily visualized if ''x'' is viewed as a two-dimensional array. One dimension is ''k'' and the other dimensions is the particle number. For example, <math>x(k,i)</math> would be the i<sup>th</sup> particle at <math>k</math> and can also be written <math>x_k^{(i)}</math> (as done above in the algorithm). Step 3 generates a ''potential'' <math>x_k</math> based on a randomly chosen particle (<math>x_{k-1}^{(i)}</math>) at time <math>k-1</math> and rejects or accepts it in step 6. In other words, the <math>x_k</math> values are generated using the previously generated <math>x_{k-1}</math>.\n\n==Other particle filters==\n* [[Exponential Natural Particle Filter]]<ref name=\"xnpf2015\">{{cite arXiv\n | author = Zand, G.\n | author2= Taherkhani, M. |author3=Safabakhsh, R. \n | year = 2015\n | title = Exponential Natural Particle Filter\n | eprint = 1511.06603\n| class= cs.LG }}</ref>\n* [[Auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"apf1999\">{{cite journal\n | author = Pitt, M.K.\n |author2=Shephard, N.\n | year = 1999\n | title = Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filters\n | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association\n | volume = 94\n | issue = 446\n | pages = 590\u2013591\n | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5002321997 \n | accessdate = 2008-05-06\n | doi = 10.2307/2670179\n | jstor = 2670179\n }}</ref>\n* [[Regularized auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"jliu2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Liu, J.\n |author2=Wang, W. |author3=Ma, F. \n | year = 2011\n | title = A Regularized Auxiliary Particle Filtering Approach for System State Estimation and Battery Life Prediction\n | journal = Smart Materials and Structures\n | volume = 20\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 1\u20139\n | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/20/7/075021\n| bibcode = 2011SMaS...20g5021L}}</ref>\n* Gaussian particle filter\n* Unscented particle filter\n* Gauss\u2013Hermite particle filter\n* Cost Reference particle filter\n* Hierarchical/Scalable particle filter<ref name=\"Canton2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Canton-Ferrer, C.\n |author2=Casas, J.R. |author3=Pard\u00e0s, M. \n | year = 2011\n | title = Human Motion Capture Using Scalable Body Models\n | journal = Computer Vision and Image Understanding\n | volume = 115\n | issue = 10\n | pages = 1363\u20131374\n | doi = 10.1016/j.cviu.2011.06.001\n |hdl=2117/13393 }}</ref>\n* Rao\u2013Blackwellized particle filter<ref name=\"rbpf1999\"/>\n* [[Rejection sampling|Rejection-sampling]] based optimal particle filter<ref name=\"optrj2008\">{{cite conference\n| citeseerx           = 10.1.1.190.7092\n| title         = An Optimal Filtering Algorithm for Non-Parametric Observation Models in Robot Localization\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2008\n| conference    = IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'08)\n| pages         = 461\u2013466\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"optrj2010\">{{cite journal\n| title         = Optimal Filtering for Non-Parametric Observation Models: Applications to Localization and SLAM\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2010\n| journal       = The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)\n| volume        = 29\n| number        = 14\n| pages         = 1726\u20131742\n| doi           = 10.1177/0278364910364165\n| citeseerx         = 10.1.1.1031.4931\n}}\n</ref>\n* Feynman-Kac and mean field particle methodologies<ref name=\"dm962\"/><ref name=\"dp13\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n* Particle Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, see e.g. [[Pseudo-Marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mean field particle methods]]\n* [[Genetic algorithm]]\n* [[Ensemble Kalman filter]]\n* [[Generalized filtering]]\n* [[Moving horizon estimation]]\n* [[Recursive Bayesian estimation]]\n* [[Monte Carlo localization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Del Moral | first1 = Pierre | year = 1996 | title = Non Linear Filtering: Interacting Particle Solution | url = http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~peterdel-moral/mprfs.pdf | journal = Markov Processes and Related Fields | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 555\u2013580 }}\n* Del Moral, Pierre (2004).
