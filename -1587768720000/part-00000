[[Public housing]] is priced much below the market rate, allowing people to live in more convenient locations rather than move away from the city in search of lower rents. In most federally-funded rental assistance programs, the tenants' monthly rent is set at 30% of their household income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/topics/rental_assistance/phprog|title=HUD.gov / U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)|website=www.hud.gov}}</ref> Now increasingly provided in a variety of settings and formats, originally public housing in the U.S. consisted primarily of one or more concentrated blocks of low-rise and/or high-rise apartment buildings. These complexes are operated by state and local housing authorities which are authorized and funded by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD). More than 1.2 million households currently live in public housing of some type.{{Vague|date=April 2015}} Subsidized apartment buildings, often referred to as '''housing projects''', have a complicated and often notorious history in the United States. While the first decades of projects were built with higher construction standards and a broader range of incomes and same applicants, over time, public housing increasingly became the housing of last resort in many cities. Several reasons have been cited for this negative trend including the failure of Congress to provide sufficient funding, a lowering of standards for occupancy, and mismanagement at the local level. Furthermore, housing projects have also been seen to greatly increase [[concentrated poverty]] in a community, leading to several negative [[Externality|externalities]]. Crime, drug usage, and educational under-performance are all widely associated with housing projects, particularly in urban areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/new-york-citys-public-housing-crisis/393644/|title=New York City's Public-Housing Crisis|first=Alana|last=Semuels|work=theatlantic.com|accessdate=16 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531234646/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/new-york-citys-public-housing-crisis/393644/|archivedate=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their various problems and diminished political support, many of the traditional low-income public housing properties constructed in the earlier years of the program have been demolished.  Beginning primarily in the 1970s the federal government turned to other approaches including the Project-Based [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] program, Section 8 certificates, and the Housing Choice Voucher Program. In the 1990s the federal government accelerated the transformation of traditional public housing through HUD's [[HOPE VI]] Program. Hope VI funds are used to tear down distressed public housing projects and replace them with mixed communities constructed in cooperation with private partners.<ref>{{cite news |author=Eckholm, Erik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/us/21housing.html |title=Washington's Grand Experiment to Rehouse the Poor |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 21, 2008 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210022615/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/us/21housing.html |archivedate=February 10, 2013 }}</ref> In 2012, Congress and HUD initiated a new program called the [[Rental Assistance Demonstration]] (RAD) program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/rad/|title=Rental Assistance Demonstration - HUD Exchange|website=www.hudexchange.info|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809032419/https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/rad/|archivedate=2016-08-09}}</ref> Under the demonstration program, eligible public housing properties are redeveloped in conjunction with private developers and investors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early efforts===\n[[File:Jacob Riis, Lodgers in a Crowded Bayard Street Tenement.jpg|thumb|250px|Photograph of New York City tenement lodgings by Jacob Riis for [[How the Other Half Lives]], first published in 1890.]]\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, government involvement in housing for the poor was chiefly in the area of building code enforcement, requiring new buildings to meet certain standards for decent [[livability]] (e.g. proper ventilation), and forcing landlords to make some modifications to existing building stock. Photojournalist Jacob Riis' ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' (1890) brought considerable attention the conditions of the slums in New York City, sparking new attention to housing conditions around the country.\n\nEarly tenement reform was primarily a philanthropic venture, with Model Tenements built as early as the 1870s which attempted to use new architectural and management models to address the physical and social problems of the slums.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\">{{cite book |editors=Bauman, John F. and Biles, Roger |title=From Tenements to the Taylor Homes: In Search of an Urban Housing Policy in Twentieth Century America |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-271-02012-1}}</ref> These attempts were limited by available resources, and early efforts were soon redirected towards building code reform. The New York Tenement Act of 1895 and Tenement Law of 1901 were early attempts to address building codes in New York City, which were then copied in Chicago, Philadelphia, and other American cities.\n\nIn 1910, the National Housing Association (NHA) was created to improve housing conditions in urban and suburban neighborhoods through the enactment of better regulation and increased awareness. The NHA was founded by [[Lawrence Veiller]], author of ''Model Tenement House Law'' (1910), and consisted of delegates from dozens of cities.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> Over time, the focus of the housing movement shifted from a focus on proper building typology to community development on a broader scale, and the NHA dissolved in 1936.\n\nThe [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|City of Milwaukee]], under socialist mayor [[Daniel Hoan]], implemented the country's first public housing project, known as [[Garden Homes Historic District (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Garden Homes]], in 1923. This experiment with a municipally-sponsored housing cooperative saw initial success, but was plagued by development and land acquisition problems, and the board overseeing the project dissolved the Gardens Home Corporation just two years after construction on the homes was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityHPC/DesignatedReports/vticnf/GardenHomesDistrict_HPCStudyRe.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201141102/http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityHPC/DesignatedReports/vticnf/GardenHomesDistrict_HPCStudyRe.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-01 }}</ref>\n\n===Public Works Administration (PWA) Housing Division===\n\nPermanent, federally funded housing came into being in the United States as a part of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Title II, Section 202 of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], passed June 16, 1933, directed the Public Works Administration (PWA) to develop a program for the \"construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair under public regulation or control of low-cost housing and [[slum clearance]] projects ...\". Led by the Housing Division of the PWA and headed by architect [[Robert D. Kohn|Robert Kohn]], the initial, Limited-Dividend Program aimed to provide low-interest loans to public or private groups to fund the construction of low-income housing.\n\nToo few qualified applicants stepped forward, and the Limited-Dividend Program funded only seven housing projects nationally. In the spring of 1934, PWA Administrator [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] directed the Housing Division to undertake the direct construction of public housing, a decisive step that would serve as a precedent for the [[Housing Act of 1937|1937 Wagner-Steagall Housing Act]], and the permanent public housing program in the United States. Kohn stepped down during the reorganization, and between 1934 and 1937 the Housing Division, now headed by Colonel Horatio B. Hackett, constructed fifty-two housing projects across the United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Atlanta's [[Techwood Homes]] opened on 1 September 1936 and was the first of the fifty-two opened.\n\n[[File:Techwood1.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Techwood Homes]] in [[Atlanta]], first U.S. public housing project opened in 1936.]]\nBased on the residential planning concepts of Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, these fifty-two projects are architecturally cohesive, with composed on one to four story row house and apartment buildings, arranged around open spaces, creating traffic-free play spaces that defined community lift. Many of these projects were built on slum land, but land acquisition proved difficult, so abandoned industrial sites and vacant land were also purchased. Lexington's two early projects were constructed on an abandoned horse racing track. At Ickes' direction, many of these projects were also segregated, designed and built for either whites or African-Americans. Race was largely determined by the neighborhood surrounding the site, as American residential patterns, in both the North and South, were highly segregated.\n\nComing out of the housing movement at the turn of the century, the 1930s also saw the creation of the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC), which refinanced loans in order to keep the housing market afloat. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA), which used only a small capital investment from the federal government to insure mortgages. Construction of public housing projects were therefore only one portion of the federal housing efforts during the Great Depression.<ref name=\"Keith\">{{cite book |author=Keith, Nathaniel S |title=Politics and the Housing Crisis since 1930 |publisher=Universe Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-87663-912-0}}</ref>\n\n===Housing Act of 1937===\n\nIn 1937, the [[Housing Act of 1937|Wagner-Steagall Housing Act]] replaced the temporary PWA Housing Division with a permanent, quasi-autonomous agency to administer housing. The new United States Housing Authority [[Housing Act of 1937]] would operate with a strong bent towards local efforts in locating and constructing housing and would place caps on how much could be spent per housing unit. The cap of $5,000 was a hotly contested feature of the bill as it would be a considerable reduction of the money spent on PWA housing and was far less than advocates of the bill had lobbied to get.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nConstruction of housing projects dramatically accelerated under the new structure. In 1939 alone, 50,000 housing units were constructed\u2014more than twice as many as were built during the entire tenure of the PWA Housing Division.<ref name=\"Keith\"/> Building on the Housing Division's organizational and architectural precedent, the USHA built housing in the build-up to World War II, supported war-production efforts and battled the housing shortage that occurred after the end of the war. In the 1960s, across the nation, housing authorities became key partners in urban renewal efforts, constructing new homes for those displaced by highway, hospital and other public efforts.\n\n===World War II Era===\n\nAs part of the war mobilization, entire communities sprang up around factories manufacturing military goods. In 1940, Congress therefore authorized the US Housing Authority to build twenty public housing developments around these private companies to sustain the war effort. There was considerable debate over whether these should be permanent dwellings, furthering reformer goals of establishing a broader public housing effort, or temporary dwellings in keeping with the timeliness of the need. The Defense Housing Division was founded in 1941 and would ultimately construct eight developments of temporary housing, though many ended up as long-term housing after the war.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nOne of the most unusual US public housing initiatives was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late [[New Deal]] (1940\u201342) under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]] under the direction of [[Colonel Lawrence Westbrook]]. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.\n\nDuring World War II, construction of homes dramatically decreased as all efforts were directed towards the War. When the veterans returned from overseas, they came ready to start a new life, often with families, and did so with the funding resources of the [[G.I. Bill]] to start a new mortgage. However, there was not enough housing stock to accommodate the demand.<ref name=\"Keith\"/> As a result, President Truman created the office of Housing Expediter by executive order on January 26, 1946, to be headed by Wilson Wyatt. Through this office, government intervened in the housing market largely through price controls and supply chain restrictions, despite political pressure from some factions to directly construct housing. Efforts moved to focus exclusively on veterans housing, specifically a materials subsidy for housing construction. However, in the wake of the 1946 elections, President Truman believed there was insufficient public support to continue such materials restrictions and subsidies. The [[Veterans' Emergency Housing Program]] ended on January 1947 by an executive order from President Truman.<ref name=\"Keith\"/>\n\n===Housing Act of 1949===\n\nWith the Office of Housing Expediter ended, housing efforts moved to look at new, comprehensive approaches to address housing issues. The result was the [[Housing Act of 1949]], which dramatically expanded the role of the federal government in both public and private housing. Part of Truman's [[Fair Deal]], the Act covered three primary areas: (1) It expanded the Federal Housing Administration and federal involvement in mortgage insurance, (2) under Title I, it provided authority and funds for slum clearance and [[urban renewal]], and (3) initiated construction of a significant public housing program. Title II of the legislation stated the goal of a \"decent home in a decent environment for every American,\" and the legislation authorized $13 billion mortgage guarantees, $1.5 billion for slum redevelopment, and set a construction goal of 810,000 units of public housing.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nUpon its passage, Truman told the press:\n<blockquote>\"[This legislation] opens up the prospect of decent homes in wholesome surroundings for low-income families now living in the squalor of the slums. It equips the Federal Government, for the first time, with effective means for aiding cities in the vital task of clearing slums and rebuilding blighted areas. This legislation permits us to take a long step toward increasing the well-being and happiness of millions of our fellow citizens. Let us not delay in fulfilling that high purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=13246 |title=157 - Statement by the President Upon Signing the Housing Act of 1949 |accessdate=2013-01-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225210/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=13246 |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Housing in the 1960s===\n\n====Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965====\n\nDiscontent with Urban Renewal came fairly swiftly on the heels of the passage of Title I and the Housing Act of 1949. Urban renewal had become, for many cities, a way to eliminate blight, but not a solid vehicle for constructing new housing. For example, in the ten years after the bill was passed, 425,000 units of housing were razed under its auspices, but only 125,000 units were constructed.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> Between Title I and the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]], entire communities in poorer, urban neighborhoods were demolished to make way for modern developments and transportation needs, often in the '[[towers in the park]]' style of [[Le Corbusier]]. [[Jane Jacobs]] would famously describe the new products as, \"Low-income projects that become worse centers of delinquency, vandalism, and general social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace. Middle-income housing projects which are truly marvels of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life. Luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity, or try to, with vapid vulgarity ... This is not the rebuilding of cities. This is the sacking of cities.\"<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite book |author=Jacobs, Jane |title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1961}}</ref>\n\nSeveral additional housing acts were passed after 1949, altering the program in small ways, such as shifting ratios for elderly housing, but no major legislation changed the mechanisms of public housing until the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965]]. This act created the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), a cabinet-level agency to lead with housing. This act also introduced rent subsidies for the first time, the beginning of a shift towards encouraging privately constructed low-income housing. With this legislation, the FHA would insure mortgages for non-profits which would then construct homes for low-income families. HUD could then provide subsidies to bridge the gap between the cost of these units and a set percentage of a household's income.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nThe 1961 Housing Act quietly introduced a program under Section 23 which allowed local housing authorities to house individuals on their waiting lists in privately leased units through the mechanism of a [[voucher]] which covered the gap between household ability to pay and the market rent. This mechanism was repeatedly expanded in later legislation.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\">{{cite book |author=Hays, R. Allen |title=The Federal Government and Urban Housing: Ideology and Change in Public Policy |url=https://archive.org/details/federalgovernmen00hays |url-access=registration |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-7914-2326-3}}</ref>\n\n==== [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] ====\n[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]], Pruitt and Igoe consisted of the thirty-three buildings pictured. Dramatic images of its demolition made newspapers across the country.]]\n\nIn response to many of the emerging concerns regarding new public housing developments, the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] attempt to shift the style of housing developments, looking to the Garden Cities model of [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The act prohibited the construction of high-rise developments for families with children. The role of high-rises had always been contentious, but with rising rates of vandalism and vacancy and considerable concerns about the concentration of poverty, some contended these developments were declared unsuitable for families.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> One of the most notorious of these developments was the [[Pruitt-Igoe]] development in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], constructed in 1955 and 1956. This development posted 2,870 units in thirty-three high rises buildings.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> By the late 1960s, vacancy rates reached as high as 65%, and the project was demolished between 1972 and 1975. More recent scholarship about the story of Pruitt-Igoe, which has often been used as a parable for the failures of large-scale public housing in the United States, has elucidated that the unraveling of the complex had more to do with structural racism, disinvestment in the urban core, white flight, and the diminishing post-industrial incomes of the buildings' residents than with high rise architecture or the nature of publicly-owned and -operated housing<ref>{{cite news |last1=S. |first1=J. |title=Why the Pruitt-Igoe housing project failed |url=https://www.economist.com/prospero/2011/10/15/why-the-pruitt-igoe-housing-project-failed |accessdate=15 July 2019 |publisher=The Economist |date=15 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bristol |first1=Katharine |title=The Pruitt-Igoe Myth |url=https://rasmusbroennum.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1991-bristol-pruitt-igoemyth.pdf |website=RASMUS BR\u00d8NNUM \u2013 en Arkitektur Blog |accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>. \n\nThe Act also impacted the home ownership market through the expansion of the FHA. [[Ginnie Mae]] was initially established to purchase risky public housing projects and resell them at market rates. In addition, [[Section 235]] originated mortgage subsidies by reducing the interest rate on mortgages for low-income families to a rate more comparable to that of the FHA mortgages. The program suffered from high foreclosure rates and administrative scandal, and was dramatically scaled down in 1974. The [[Section 236]] program subsidized the debt service on private developments which would then be offered at a reduced rates to households below a certain income ceiling.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\n===Housing in the 1970s===\n\n====Experimental Housing Allowance Program====\nThe Housing Act of 1970 established the [[Experimental Housing Allowance Program]] (EHAP), a lengthy investigation in the potential market effects of housing vouchers. Vouchers, initially introduced in 1965, were an attempt to subsidize the demand side of the housing market rather than the supply side by supplementing a household's rent allowance until they were able to afford market rates. EHAP was designed to test three aspects of the impact of vouchers:\n* Demand: Investigated user dynamics, including mobility, participation rates, rent rates, and housing standards.\n* Supply: Monitored the market response to the subsidy, namely whether it changed the construction or rent rates for the community, writ large.\n* Administration: Examined several different approaches to structuring and managing the programs.\n\nUltimately, new legislation on housing vouchers did not wait for the conclusion of the experiment. When the program concluded over a decade later, it was discovered that the program had minimal impact on surrounding rents, but did have the potential to tighten the market for low-income housing, and communities were in need of an infusion of additional units. Some therefore argued that public housing was the appropriate model for cost and supply-chain reasons, though vouchers did not appear to overly distort local housing markets.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\n====Housing moratorium====\nIn 1973, President [[Richard Nixon]] halted funding for numerous housing projects in the wake of concerns regarding the housing projects constructed in the prior two decades. HUD Secretary [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] declared that the moratorium would encompass all money for Urban Renewal and [[Model Cities]] programs, all subsidized housing, and Section 235 and 236 funding.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/> An intensive report was commissioned from the National Housing Policy Review to analyze and assess the federal government's role in housing. This report, entitled ''Housing in the Seventies'' was instrumental in crafting new housing legislation the following year. In keeping with Nixon's market-based approach, as demonstrated by EHAP, Nixon also lifted the moratorium on the Section 23 voucher program late in September, allowing for 200,000 new households to be funded. The full moratorium was lifted in the summer of 1974, as Nixon faced [[impeachment]] in the wake of [[Watergate]].\n\n====Housing and Community Development Act of 1974====\nThe [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]] created the [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Housing Program to encourage the private sector to construct affordable homes. This kind of housing assistance assists poor tenants by giving a monthly subsidy to their landlords. This assistance can be 'project based,' which applies to specific properties, or 'tenant based,' which provides tenants with a voucher they can use anywhere vouchers are accepted. Tenant based housing vouchers covered the gap between 25% of a household's income and established [[fair market rent]]. Virtually no new project based Section 8 housing has been produced since 1983, but tenant based vouchers are now the primary mechanism of assisted housing.\n\nThe other main feature of the Act was the creation of the [[Community Development Block Grant]] (CDBG). While not directly tied to public housing, CDBGs were lump sums of money, the amount of which was determined by a formula focusing on population, given to state and local governments for housing and community development work.<ref name=\"CBDG\">{{cite web |url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs |title=Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG |publisher=HUD |url-status=dead |accessdate=2013-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116000725/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fcomm_planning%2Fcommunitydevelopment%2Fprograms |archivedate=2013-01-16 }}</ref> The sum could be used as determined by the community, though the legislation also required the development of [[Housing Assistance Plan]]s (HAP) which required local communities to survey and catalog their available housing stock as well as determine the populations most in need of assistance. These were submitted as part of the CDBG application.\n\nAgain in response to the growing discontent with public housing, urban developers began looking for alternate forms of affordable, low-income housing. From this concern sprang the creation of [[scattered-site housing]] programs designed to place smaller-scale, better-integrated public housing units in diverse neighborhoods. Scattered-site housing programs became popularized in the late 1970s and 1980s. Since that time, cities across the country have implemented such programs with varying levels of success.\n\n===Housing in the 1980s-1990s===\n\nChanges to public housing programs were minor during the 1980s. Under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, household contribution towards Section 8 rents was increased to 30% of household income and fair market rents were lowered. Public assistance for housing efforts was reduced as part of a package of across the board cuts. Additionally, emergency shelters for the homeless were expanded, and home ownership by low-income families was promoted to a greater degree.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\nIn 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), which furthered the use of HOME funds for rental assistance. In his address upon its passage, Bush said, \"Although the Federal Government currently serves about 4.3 million low-income families, there are about 4 million additional families, most of them very low income, whose housing needs have not been met. We should not divert assistance from those who need it most.\"<ref name=\"NAHA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=19102 |title=Statement on Signing the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720123819/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=19102 |archivedate=2013-07-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe next new era in public housing began in 1992 with the launch of the [[HOPE VI]] program. HOPE VI funds were devoted to demolishing poor-quality public housing projects and replacing them with lower-density developments, often of mixed-income. Funds included construction and demolition costs, tenant relocation costs, and subsidies for newly constructed units.<ref name=\"Revolution\">{{Citation |last=Erickson |first=David J. |title=The Housing Policy Revolution: Networks and Neighbors |place=Washington, DC |publisher=Urban Institute Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-87766-760-5}}.</ref> HOPE VI has become the primary vehicle for the construction of new federally subsidized units, but it suffered considerable funding cuts in 2004 under President [[George W. Bush]].\n\nIn 1998, the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA) was passed and signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. Following the frame of [[welfare reform]], QHWRA developed new programs to transition families out of public housing, developed a home ownership model for Section 8, and expanded the HOPE VI program to replace traditional public housing units.\n\n==Social issues==\n\n===Concentrated poverty===\nAccording to HUD's Residential Characteristic Report, the average annual income in 2013 for a resident of a public housing unit is $13,730.<ref name=HUDRCR>HUD.

When their protests did not help, they left for the suburbs, also known as [[white flight]].]]\n\nSegregation in public housing has roots in the early developments and activities of the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA), created by the [[National Housing Act of 1934|Housing Act of 1934]].<ref name=Gotham>Gotham, Kevin Fox, \"Separate and Unequal: The Housing Act of 1968 and the Section 235 Program.\" Sociological Forum , Vol. 15, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 13-37</ref> The FHA institutionalized a practice by which it would seek to maintain racially homogenous neighborhoods through racially restrictive covenants - an explicitly discriminatory policy written into the deed of a house. This practice was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1948 in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.<ref name=Gotham /> However, according to Gotham (2000), Section 235 of the Housing Act of 1968 encouraged [[white flight]] from the inner city, selling suburban properties to whites and inner-city properties to blacks, creating neighborhoods that were racially isolated from others.<ref name=Gotham /> \n\nWhite flight - white people moving out of neighborhoods that have become more racially or ethnoculturally heterogeneous - is an example of how stigma and judgement around public housing and affordable housing resulted in a significant change in the racial demographics of urban housing. White flight is a sociological response to perceptions that racially diverse neighborhoods will decrease their home value and increase crime rates. \n\nMcNulty and Holloway (2000) studied the intersection of public housing geography, race, and crime in order to determine if racial differences existed in crime rates when controlled for the proximity of public housing units.<ref name=McNulty>McNulty, Thomas L., and Steven R.

The rebellion in Detroit in 1967 was a symptom of racial tension that was in part due to unfair housing policies. In July 1967, [[President Lyndon Johnson]] issued a commission, led by Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Otto Kerner]] to determine the causes of the riots. The [[Kerner Commission]] clearly articulated that housing inequality was solely determined by explicitly discriminatory policies. It stated that \"''White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epi.org/publication/the-supreme-courts-challenge-to-housing-segregation/|title=The Supreme Court's Challenge to Housing Segregation}}</ref> The [[Kerner Commission]] blatantly condemned white institutions for creating unequal housing opportunities, specifically highlighting restrictive covenants as a cause of the American apartheid residential pattern in the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/704134|title=Detroit Fifty Years After the Kerner Report: What Has Changed, What Has Not, and Why?|first=Reynolds|last=Farley|date=September 27, 2018|journal=RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences|volume=4|issue=6|pages=206\u2013241|doi=10.7758/rsf.2018.4.6.10|via=Project MUSE|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made housing integration a key part of his civil rights campaign and one month after the publication of the [[Kerner Commission]] was published, King was assassinated.

Web. 5 Nov. 2013.</ref> Tighe (2010) reviewed a breadth of literature on perceptions of public housing and found five major public concerns: a lack of maintenance, expectation of crime, disapproval of housing as a handout, reduction of property values, and physical unattractiveness.<ref name=Tighe /> While the reality of certain aspects may differ from the perceptions, such perceptions are strong enough to mount formidable opposition to public housing programs.<ref name=Tighe />\n\nIn a separate study, Freeman and Botein (2002) found four major areas of public concern related to public housing: reduction in property values, racial transition, concentrated poverty, and increased crime.<ref name=FreemanBotein /> The study concludes that such concerns are only warranted in certain circumstances, and in varying degrees. While negative consequences have potential to occur with the building of public housing, there is an almost equal chance of the public housing having the opposite effect of creating positive impacts within the neighborhood.<ref name=FreemanBotein />\n\n==Alternative models==\n\n===Scattered-site housing===\n\"Scattered-site\" or \"scatter site\" refers to a form of housing in which publicly funded, affordable, low-density units are scattered throughout diverse, middle-class neighborhoods. It can take the form of single units spread throughout the city or clusters of family units.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\">[http://evans.washington.edu/files/public-housing-job-search.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612192748/http://evans.washington.edu/files/public-housing-job-search.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nScattered-site housing can also be managed by private not-for-profit organizations using a permanent, supportive housing model, where specific barriers to the housing of the low-income individual or family are addressed in regular visits with a case manager. In New York City, The Scatter Site Apartment Program provides city contracts to not-for-profits from the HIV/AIDS Services Administration under the New York City Human Resources Administration. Also, Scattered Site is one of two models, the other being Congregate, which are utilized in the New York/New York housing agreements between New York City and New York State.\n\n====Background====\nScattered-site housing units were originally constructed as an alternative form of public housing designed to prevent the concentration of poverty associated with more traditional high-density units. The benchmark class-action case that led to the popularization of scattered-site models was Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority in 1969. Much of motivation for this trial and lawsuit stemmed from concerns about [[residential segregation]]. It was believed that the placement of public housing facilities in primarily black neighborhoods perpetuated [[residential segregation]]. The lawsuit was finally resolved with a verdict mandating that the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] redistribute public housing into non-black neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Oldweiler\">Oldweiler, Cory. \"Scattered-Site Era Coming to an End.\" ''[[The Chicago Reporter]]''. September 28, 2007.</ref> U.S. District Court Judge Richard B. Austin mandated that three public housing units be built in white areas (less than 30% black) for every one unit built in black areas (more than 30% black).\n\nThese percentages have decreased since then and a wide array of programs have developed across the United States. While some programs have seen great successes, others have had difficulties in acquiring the land needed for construction and in maintaining new units.<ref name=\"Bass\">Bass, Sharon L \"Public Housing Entering New Era.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 5, 1989</ref> Eligibility requirements, generally based on household income and size, are common in these programs. In Dakota County, Minnesota, for example, eligibility ranges from a maximum of $51,550 for two people to $85,050 for 8-10 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dakotacda.org/ssph_program.htm |title=Dakota County Community Development Agency - Scattered Site Public Housing Program |publisher=Dakotacda.org |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905164931/http://www.dakotacda.org/ssph_program.htm |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nEligibility requirements are designed to ensure that those most in need receive relief first and that concerns regarding [[housing discrimination]] do not extend into the public housing sector.\n\n====Public policy and implications====\nScattered-site housing programs are generally run by the city housing authorities or local governments. They are intended to increase the availability of affordable housing and improve the quality of low-income housing, while avoiding problems associated with concentrated subsidized housing. Many scattered-site units are built to be similar in appearance to other homes in the neighborhood to somewhat mask the financial stature of tenants and reduce the stigma associated with public housing. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAn issue of great concern with regards to the implementation of scattered-site programs is where to construct these housing units and how to gain the support of the community. Frequent concerns of community members include potential decreases in the retail price of their home, a decline in neighborhood safety due to elevated levels of crime.<ref name=\"Bass\"/> Thus, one of the major concerns with the relocation of scattered-site tenants into white, middle-class neighborhoods is that residents will move elsewhere \u2013 a phenomenon known as [[white flight]]. To counter this phenomenon, some programs place tenants in private apartments that do not appear outwardly different. Despite these efforts, many members of middle-class, predominantly white neighborhoods have fought hard to keep public housing out of their communities.<ref name=\"Oldweiler\"/>\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] has proposed that concentrating low-income housing in impoverished areas can limit tenants' access to social opportunity.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/> Thus, some scattered-site programs now relocate tenants in middle-class suburban neighborhoods, hoping that immersion within social networks of greater financial stability will increase their social opportunities.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/> However, this strategy has not necessarily proved effective, especially with regards to boosting employment. When placed in neighborhoods of similar economic means, studies indicate that low-income residents use neighbors as social resources less often when living scattered throughout a neighborhood than when living in small clusters within a neighborhood.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/>\n\nThere are also concerns associated with the financial burden that these programs have on the state. Scattered-site housing provides no better living conditions for its tenants than traditional concentrated housing if the units are not properly maintained. There are questions as to whether or not scattered-site public facilities are more expensive to manage because dispersal throughout the city makes maintenance more difficult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pubasst/scatter.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202222030/http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/pubasst/scatter.html|url-status=dead|title=Scattered-Site Housing: Characteristics and Consequences &#124; HUD USER|archivedate=February 2, 2010|website=www.huduser.gov}}</ref>\n\n=== Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program ===\n[[Inclusionary zoning]] ordinances require housing developers to reserve a percentage between 10-30% of housing units from new or rehabilitated projects to be rented or sold at a below market rate for low and moderate-income households.

While the first decades of projects were built with higher construction standards and a broader range of incomes and same applicants, over time, public housing increasingly became the housing of last resort in many cities. Several reasons have been cited for this negative trend including the failure of Congress to provide sufficient funding, a lowering of standards for occupancy, and mismanagement at the local level. Furthermore, housing projects have also been seen to greatly increase [[concentrated poverty]] in a community, leading to several negative [[Externality|externalities]]. Crime, drug usage, and educational under-performance are all widely associated with housing projects, particularly in urban areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/new-york-citys-public-housing-crisis/393644/|title=New York City's Public-Housing Crisis|first=Alana|last=Semuels|work=theatlantic.com|accessdate=16 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531234646/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/new-york-citys-public-housing-crisis/393644/|archivedate=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their various problems and diminished political support, many of the traditional low-income public housing properties constructed in the earlier years of the program have been demolished.

Photojournalist Jacob Riis' ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' (1890) brought considerable attention the conditions of the slums in New York City, sparking new attention to housing conditions around the country.\n\nEarly tenement reform was primarily a philanthropic venture, with Model Tenements built as early as the 1870s which attempted to use new architectural and management models to address the physical and social problems of the slums.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\">{{cite book |editors=Bauman, John F. and Biles, Roger |title=From Tenements to the Taylor Homes: In Search of an Urban Housing Policy in Twentieth Century America |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-271-02012-1}}</ref> These attempts were limited by available resources, and early efforts were soon redirected towards building code reform. The New York Tenement Act of 1895 and Tenement Law of 1901 were early attempts to address building codes in New York City, which were then copied in Chicago, Philadelphia, and other American cities.\n\nIn 1910, the National Housing Association (NHA) was created to improve housing conditions in urban and suburban neighborhoods through the enactment of better regulation and increased awareness.

Title II, Section 202 of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], passed June 16, 1933, directed the Public Works Administration (PWA) to develop a program for the \"construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair under public regulation or control of low-cost housing and [[slum clearance]] projects ...\". Led by the Housing Division of the PWA and headed by architect [[Robert D.

Ickes|Harold Ickes]] directed the Housing Division to undertake the direct construction of public housing, a decisive step that would serve as a precedent for the [[Housing Act of 1937|1937 Wagner-Steagall Housing Act]], and the permanent public housing program in the United States. Kohn stepped down during the reorganization, and between 1934 and 1937 the Housing Division, now headed by Colonel Horatio B. Hackett, constructed fifty-two housing projects across the United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Atlanta's [[Techwood Homes]] opened on 1 September 1936 and was the first of the fifty-two opened.\n\n[[File:Techwood1.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Techwood Homes]] in [[Atlanta]], first U.S. public housing project opened in 1936.]]\nBased on the residential planning concepts of Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, these fifty-two projects are architecturally cohesive, with composed on one to four story row house and apartment buildings, arranged around open spaces, creating traffic-free play spaces that defined community lift. Many of these projects were built on slum land, but land acquisition proved difficult, so abandoned industrial sites and vacant land were also purchased. Lexington's two early projects were constructed on an abandoned horse racing track. At Ickes' direction, many of these projects were also segregated, designed and built for either whites or African-Americans. Race was largely determined by the neighborhood surrounding the site, as American residential patterns, in both the North and South, were highly segregated.\n\nComing out of the housing movement at the turn of the century, the 1930s also saw the creation of the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC), which refinanced loans in order to keep the housing market afloat. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA), which used only a small capital investment from the federal government to insure mortgages. Construction of public housing projects were therefore only one portion of the federal housing efforts during the Great Depression.<ref name=\"Keith\">{{cite book |author=Keith, Nathaniel S |title=Politics and the Housing Crisis since 1930 |publisher=Universe Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-87663-912-0}}</ref>\n\n===Housing Act of 1937===\n\nIn 1937, the [[Housing Act of 1937|Wagner-Steagall Housing Act]] replaced the temporary PWA Housing Division with a permanent, quasi-autonomous agency to administer housing. The new United States Housing Authority [[Housing Act of 1937]] would operate with a strong bent towards local efforts in locating and constructing housing and would place caps on how much could be spent per housing unit. The cap of $5,000 was a hotly contested feature of the bill as it would be a considerable reduction of the money spent on PWA housing and was far less than advocates of the bill had lobbied to get.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nConstruction of housing projects dramatically accelerated under the new structure. In 1939 alone, 50,000 housing units were constructed\u2014more than twice as many as were built during the entire tenure of the PWA Housing Division.<ref name=\"Keith\"/> Building on the Housing Division's organizational and architectural precedent, the USHA built housing in the build-up to World War II, supported war-production efforts and battled the housing shortage that occurred after the end of the war. In the 1960s, across the nation, housing authorities became key partners in urban renewal efforts, constructing new homes for those displaced by highway, hospital and other public efforts.\n\n===World War II Era===\n\nAs part of the war mobilization, entire communities sprang up around factories manufacturing military goods. In 1940, Congress therefore authorized the US Housing Authority to build twenty public housing developments around these private companies to sustain the war effort. There was considerable debate over whether these should be permanent dwellings, furthering reformer goals of establishing a broader public housing effort, or temporary dwellings in keeping with the timeliness of the need. The Defense Housing Division was founded in 1941 and would ultimately construct eight developments of temporary housing, though many ended up as long-term housing after the war.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nOne of the most unusual US public housing initiatives was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late [[New Deal]] (1940\u201342) under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]] under the direction of [[Colonel Lawrence Westbrook]]. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.\n\nDuring World War II, construction of homes dramatically decreased as all efforts were directed towards the War. When the veterans returned from overseas, they came ready to start a new life, often with families, and did so with the funding resources of the [[G.I. Bill]] to start a new mortgage. However, there was not enough housing stock to accommodate the demand.<ref name=\"Keith\"/> As a result, President Truman created the office of Housing Expediter by executive order on January 26, 1946, to be headed by Wilson Wyatt. Through this office, government intervened in the housing market largely through price controls and supply chain restrictions, despite political pressure from some factions to directly construct housing. Efforts moved to focus exclusively on veterans housing, specifically a materials subsidy for housing construction. However, in the wake of the 1946 elections, President Truman believed there was insufficient public support to continue such materials restrictions and subsidies. The [[Veterans' Emergency Housing Program]] ended on January 1947 by an executive order from President Truman.<ref name=\"Keith\"/>\n\n===Housing Act of 1949===\n\nWith the Office of Housing Expediter ended, housing efforts moved to look at new, comprehensive approaches to address housing issues. The result was the [[Housing Act of 1949]], which dramatically expanded the role of the federal government in both public and private housing. Part of Truman's [[Fair Deal]], the Act covered three primary areas: (1) It expanded the Federal Housing Administration and federal involvement in mortgage insurance, (2) under Title I, it provided authority and funds for slum clearance and [[urban renewal]], and (3) initiated construction of a significant public housing program. Title II of the legislation stated the goal of a \"decent home in a decent environment for every American,\" and the legislation authorized $13 billion mortgage guarantees, $1.5 billion for slum redevelopment, and set a construction goal of 810,000 units of public housing.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nUpon its passage, Truman told the press:\n<blockquote>\"[This legislation] opens up the prospect of decent homes in wholesome surroundings for low-income families now living in the squalor of the slums. It equips the Federal Government, for the first time, with effective means for aiding cities in the vital task of clearing slums and rebuilding blighted areas. This legislation permits us to take a long step toward increasing the well-being and happiness of millions of our fellow citizens. Let us not delay in fulfilling that high purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=13246 |title=157 - Statement by the President Upon Signing the Housing Act of 1949 |accessdate=2013-01-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225210/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=13246 |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Housing in the 1960s===\n\n====Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965====\n\nDiscontent with Urban Renewal came fairly swiftly on the heels of the passage of Title I and the Housing Act of 1949. Urban renewal had become, for many cities, a way to eliminate blight, but not a solid vehicle for constructing new housing. For example, in the ten years after the bill was passed, 425,000 units of housing were razed under its auspices, but only 125,000 units were constructed.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> Between Title I and the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]], entire communities in poorer, urban neighborhoods were demolished to make way for modern developments and transportation needs, often in the '[[towers in the park]]' style of [[Le Corbusier]]. [[Jane Jacobs]] would famously describe the new products as, \"Low-income projects that become worse centers of delinquency, vandalism, and general social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace. Middle-income housing projects which are truly marvels of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life. Luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity, or try to, with vapid vulgarity ... This is not the rebuilding of cities. This is the sacking of cities.\"<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite book |author=Jacobs, Jane |title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1961}}</ref>\n\nSeveral additional housing acts were passed after 1949, altering the program in small ways, such as shifting ratios for elderly housing, but no major legislation changed the mechanisms of public housing until the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965]]. This act created the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), a cabinet-level agency to lead with housing. This act also introduced rent subsidies for the first time, the beginning of a shift towards encouraging privately constructed low-income housing. With this legislation, the FHA would insure mortgages for non-profits which would then construct homes for low-income families. HUD could then provide subsidies to bridge the gap between the cost of these units and a set percentage of a household's income.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/>\n\nThe 1961 Housing Act quietly introduced a program under Section 23 which allowed local housing authorities to house individuals on their waiting lists in privately leased units through the mechanism of a [[voucher]] which covered the gap between household ability to pay and the market rent. This mechanism was repeatedly expanded in later legislation.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\">{{cite book |author=Hays, R. Allen |title=The Federal Government and Urban Housing: Ideology and Change in Public Policy |url=https://archive.org/details/federalgovernmen00hays |url-access=registration |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-7914-2326-3}}</ref>\n\n==== [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] ====\n[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]], Pruitt and Igoe consisted of the thirty-three buildings pictured. Dramatic images of its demolition made newspapers across the country.]]\n\nIn response to many of the emerging concerns regarding new public housing developments, the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] attempt to shift the style of housing developments, looking to the Garden Cities model of [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The act prohibited the construction of high-rise developments for families with children. The role of high-rises had always been contentious, but with rising rates of vandalism and vacancy and considerable concerns about the concentration of poverty, some contended these developments were declared unsuitable for families.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> One of the most notorious of these developments was the [[Pruitt-Igoe]] development in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], constructed in 1955 and 1956. This development posted 2,870 units in thirty-three high rises buildings.<ref name=\"Tenements to Taylor Homes\"/> By the late 1960s, vacancy rates reached as high as 65%, and the project was demolished between 1972 and 1975. More recent scholarship about the story of Pruitt-Igoe, which has often been used as a parable for the failures of large-scale public housing in the United States, has elucidated that the unraveling of the complex had more to do with structural racism, disinvestment in the urban core, white flight, and the diminishing post-industrial incomes of the buildings' residents than with high rise architecture or the nature of publicly-owned and -operated housing<ref>{{cite news |last1=S. |first1=J. |title=Why the Pruitt-Igoe housing project failed |url=https://www.economist.com/prospero/2011/10/15/why-the-pruitt-igoe-housing-project-failed |accessdate=15 July 2019 |publisher=The Economist |date=15 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bristol |first1=Katharine |title=The Pruitt-Igoe Myth |url=https://rasmusbroennum.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1991-bristol-pruitt-igoemyth.pdf |website=RASMUS BR\u00d8NNUM \u2013 en Arkitektur Blog |accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>. \n\nThe Act also impacted the home ownership market through the expansion of the FHA. [[Ginnie Mae]] was initially established to purchase risky public housing projects and resell them at market rates. In addition, [[Section 235]] originated mortgage subsidies by reducing the interest rate on mortgages for low-income families to a rate more comparable to that of the FHA mortgages. The program suffered from high foreclosure rates and administrative scandal, and was dramatically scaled down in 1974. The [[Section 236]] program subsidized the debt service on private developments which would then be offered at a reduced rates to households below a certain income ceiling.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\n===Housing in the 1970s===\n\n====Experimental Housing Allowance Program====\nThe Housing Act of 1970 established the [[Experimental Housing Allowance Program]] (EHAP), a lengthy investigation in the potential market effects of housing vouchers. Vouchers, initially introduced in 1965, were an attempt to subsidize the demand side of the housing market rather than the supply side by supplementing a household's rent allowance until they were able to afford market rates. EHAP was designed to test three aspects of the impact of vouchers:\n* Demand: Investigated user dynamics, including mobility, participation rates, rent rates, and housing standards.\n* Supply: Monitored the market response to the subsidy, namely whether it changed the construction or rent rates for the community, writ large.\n* Administration: Examined several different approaches to structuring and managing the programs.\n\nUltimately, new legislation on housing vouchers did not wait for the conclusion of the experiment. When the program concluded over a decade later, it was discovered that the program had minimal impact on surrounding rents, but did have the potential to tighten the market for low-income housing, and communities were in need of an infusion of additional units. Some therefore argued that public housing was the appropriate model for cost and supply-chain reasons, though vouchers did not appear to overly distort local housing markets.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\n====Housing moratorium====\nIn 1973, President [[Richard Nixon]] halted funding for numerous housing projects in the wake of concerns regarding the housing projects constructed in the prior two decades. HUD Secretary [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] declared that the moratorium would encompass all money for Urban Renewal and [[Model Cities]] programs, all subsidized housing, and Section 235 and 236 funding.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/> An intensive report was commissioned from the National Housing Policy Review to analyze and assess the federal government's role in housing. This report, entitled ''Housing in the Seventies'' was instrumental in crafting new housing legislation the following year. In keeping with Nixon's market-based approach, as demonstrated by EHAP, Nixon also lifted the moratorium on the Section 23 voucher program late in September, allowing for 200,000 new households to be funded. The full moratorium was lifted in the summer of 1974, as Nixon faced [[impeachment]] in the wake of [[Watergate]].\n\n====Housing and Community Development Act of 1974====\nThe [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]] created the [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Housing Program to encourage the private sector to construct affordable homes. This kind of housing assistance assists poor tenants by giving a monthly subsidy to their landlords. This assistance can be 'project based,' which applies to specific properties, or 'tenant based,' which provides tenants with a voucher they can use anywhere vouchers are accepted. Tenant based housing vouchers covered the gap between 25% of a household's income and established [[fair market rent]]. Virtually no new project based Section 8 housing has been produced since 1983, but tenant based vouchers are now the primary mechanism of assisted housing.\n\nThe other main feature of the Act was the creation of the [[Community Development Block Grant]] (CDBG). While not directly tied to public housing, CDBGs were lump sums of money, the amount of which was determined by a formula focusing on population, given to state and local governments for housing and community development work.<ref name=\"CBDG\">{{cite web |url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs |title=Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG |publisher=HUD |url-status=dead |accessdate=2013-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116000725/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fcomm_planning%2Fcommunitydevelopment%2Fprograms |archivedate=2013-01-16 }}</ref> The sum could be used as determined by the community, though the legislation also required the development of [[Housing Assistance Plan]]s (HAP) which required local communities to survey and catalog their available housing stock as well as determine the populations most in need of assistance. These were submitted as part of the CDBG application.\n\nAgain in response to the growing discontent with public housing, urban developers began looking for alternate forms of affordable, low-income housing. From this concern sprang the creation of [[scattered-site housing]] programs designed to place smaller-scale, better-integrated public housing units in diverse neighborhoods. Scattered-site housing programs became popularized in the late 1970s and 1980s. Since that time, cities across the country have implemented such programs with varying levels of success.\n\n===Housing in the 1980s-1990s===\n\nChanges to public housing programs were minor during the 1980s. Under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, household contribution towards Section 8 rents was increased to 30% of household income and fair market rents were lowered. Public assistance for housing efforts was reduced as part of a package of across the board cuts. Additionally, emergency shelters for the homeless were expanded, and home ownership by low-income families was promoted to a greater degree.<ref name=\"Urban Housing\"/>\n\nIn 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), which furthered the use of HOME funds for rental assistance. In his address upon its passage, Bush said, \"Although the Federal Government currently serves about 4.3 million low-income families, there are about 4 million additional families, most of them very low income, whose housing needs have not been met. We should not divert assistance from those who need it most.\"<ref name=\"NAHA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=19102 |title=Statement on Signing the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720123819/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=19102 |archivedate=2013-07-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe next new era in public housing began in 1992 with the launch of the [[HOPE VI]] program. HOPE VI funds were devoted to demolishing poor-quality public housing projects and replacing them with lower-density developments, often of mixed-income. Funds included construction and demolition costs, tenant relocation costs, and subsidies for newly constructed units.<ref name=\"Revolution\">{{Citation |last=Erickson |first=David J. |title=The Housing Policy Revolution: Networks and Neighbors |place=Washington, DC |publisher=Urban Institute Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-87766-760-5}}.</ref> HOPE VI has become the primary vehicle for the construction of new federally subsidized units, but it suffered considerable funding cuts in 2004 under President [[George W. Bush]].\n\nIn 1998, the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA) was passed and signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. Following the frame of [[welfare reform]], QHWRA developed new programs to transition families out of public housing, developed a home ownership model for Section 8, and expanded the HOPE VI program to replace traditional public housing units.\n\n==Social issues==\n\n===Concentrated poverty===\nAccording to HUD's Residential Characteristic Report, the average annual income in 2013 for a resident of a public housing unit is $13,730.<ref name=HUDRCR>HUD.

When their protests did not help, they left for the suburbs, also known as [[white flight]].]]\n\nSegregation in public housing has roots in the early developments and activities of the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA), created by the [[National Housing Act of 1934|Housing Act of 1934]].<ref name=Gotham>Gotham, Kevin Fox, \"Separate and Unequal: The Housing Act of 1968 and the Section 235 Program.\" Sociological Forum , Vol. 15, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 13-37</ref> The FHA institutionalized a practice by which it would seek to maintain racially homogenous neighborhoods through racially restrictive covenants - an explicitly discriminatory policy written into the deed of a house. This practice was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1948 in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.<ref name=Gotham /> However, according to Gotham (2000), Section 235 of the Housing Act of 1968 encouraged [[white flight]] from the inner city, selling suburban properties to whites and inner-city properties to blacks, creating neighborhoods that were racially isolated from others.<ref name=Gotham /> \n\nWhite flight - white people moving out of neighborhoods that have become more racially or ethnoculturally heterogeneous - is an example of how stigma and judgement around public housing and affordable housing resulted in a significant change in the racial demographics of urban housing. White flight is a sociological response to perceptions that racially diverse neighborhoods will decrease their home value and increase crime rates. \n\nMcNulty and Holloway (2000) studied the intersection of public housing geography, race, and crime in order to determine if racial differences existed in crime rates when controlled for the proximity of public housing units.<ref name=McNulty>McNulty, Thomas L., and Steven R.

The rebellion in Detroit in 1967 was a symptom of racial tension that was in part due to unfair housing policies. In July 1967, [[President Lyndon Johnson]] issued a commission, led by Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Otto Kerner]] to determine the causes of the riots. The [[Kerner Commission]] clearly articulated that housing inequality was solely determined by explicitly discriminatory policies. It stated that \"''White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epi.org/publication/the-supreme-courts-challenge-to-housing-segregation/|title=The Supreme Court's Challenge to Housing Segregation}}</ref> The [[Kerner Commission]] blatantly condemned white institutions for creating unequal housing opportunities, specifically highlighting restrictive covenants as a cause of the American apartheid residential pattern in the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/704134|title=Detroit Fifty Years After the Kerner Report: What Has Changed, What Has Not, and Why?|first=Reynolds|last=Farley|date=September 27, 2018|journal=RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences|volume=4|issue=6|pages=206\u2013241|doi=10.7758/rsf.2018.4.6.10|via=Project MUSE|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made housing integration a key part of his civil rights campaign and one month after the publication of the [[Kerner Commission]] was published, King was assassinated. His murder instigated another wave of riots and in response, and no later than a week after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], Congress passed the [[Fair Housing Act]] which prohibited discrimination in housing. \n\nHowever, since the [[Fair Housing Act]] was passed, housing policies restricting minority housing to segregated neighborhoods are still heavily debated because of the vague language used in the [[Fair Housing Act]]. In the 2015 Supreme Court case ''[[Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project]]'',  Justice Kennedy clarified that the [[Fair Housing Act]] was intended to promote equity, not just eliminate explicit acts of discrimination. Changes in both public policy and social narrative are equally necessary for establishing equitable housing opportunities for all Americans.\n\n===Health and safety===\nPublic housing units themselves offer very few amenities to occupants, providing the minimum necessary accommodations for living.<ref name=Schill>Schill, Michael H. \"Distressed Public Housing: Where Do We Go from Here?\" The University of Chicago Law Review 60.2 (1993): 497-554.

These [[homicide]]s tend to be localized within the public housing unit rather than around it.<ref>Griffiths, Elizabeth and Tita, George, \"Homicide In and Around Public Housing: Is Public Housing a Hotbed, a Magnet, or a Generator of Violence for the Surrounding Community?\" Elizabeth Griffiths, George Tita Social Problems , Vol. 56, No. 3 (August 2009), pp. 474-493</ref>\n\nSatisfaction with one's living environment is another variable affected by public housing.<ref name=Ross>Ross, Lauren M., Anne B.

A study by Currie and Yelowitz (1999) found that families living in public housing were less likely to experience overcrowding in their units.<ref name=CurrieYelowitz>Janet Currie, Aaron Yelowitz \"Are public housing projects good for kids?\" Journal of Public Economics, Volume 75, Issue 1, January 2000, Pages 99\u2013124</ref> Children living in public housing were 11% less likely to be held back a grade, suggesting that public housing may help low-income students.<ref name=CurrieYelowitz /> A 2011 report from the Center for Housing Policy argued for the benefits of stable and affordable housing in regard to education.<ref name=Brennan>Brennan, Maya.

Rosie. \"Public Opinion and Affordable Housing: A Review of the Literature.\" Journal of Planning Literature 25.1 (2010): 3-17. Web. 5 Nov. 2013.</ref> Tighe (2010) reviewed a breadth of literature on perceptions of public housing and found five major public concerns: a lack of maintenance, expectation of crime, disapproval of housing as a handout, reduction of property values, and physical unattractiveness.<ref name=Tighe /> While the reality of certain aspects may differ from the perceptions, such perceptions are strong enough to mount formidable opposition to public housing programs.<ref name=Tighe />\n\nIn a separate study, Freeman and Botein (2002) found four major areas of public concern related to public housing: reduction in property values, racial transition, concentrated poverty, and increased crime.<ref name=FreemanBotein /> The study concludes that such concerns are only warranted in certain circumstances, and in varying degrees. While negative consequences have potential to occur with the building of public housing, there is an almost equal chance of the public housing having the opposite effect of creating positive impacts within the neighborhood.<ref name=FreemanBotein />\n\n==Alternative models==\n\n===Scattered-site housing===\n\"Scattered-site\" or \"scatter site\" refers to a form of housing in which publicly funded, affordable, low-density units are scattered throughout diverse, middle-class neighborhoods. It can take the form of single units spread throughout the city or clusters of family units.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\">[http://evans.washington.edu/files/public-housing-job-search.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612192748/http://evans.washington.edu/files/public-housing-job-search.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nScattered-site housing can also be managed by private not-for-profit organizations using a permanent, supportive housing model, where specific barriers to the housing of the low-income individual or family are addressed in regular visits with a case manager. In New York City, The Scatter Site Apartment Program provides city contracts to not-for-profits from the HIV/AIDS Services Administration under the New York City Human Resources Administration. Also, Scattered Site is one of two models, the other being Congregate, which are utilized in the New York/New York housing agreements between New York City and New York State.\n\n====Background====\nScattered-site housing units were originally constructed as an alternative form of public housing designed to prevent the concentration of poverty associated with more traditional high-density units. The benchmark class-action case that led to the popularization of scattered-site models was Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority in 1969. Much of motivation for this trial and lawsuit stemmed from concerns about [[residential segregation]]. It was believed that the placement of public housing facilities in primarily black neighborhoods perpetuated [[residential segregation]]. The lawsuit was finally resolved with a verdict mandating that the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] redistribute public housing into non-black neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Oldweiler\">Oldweiler, Cory. \"Scattered-Site Era Coming to an End.\" ''[[The Chicago Reporter]]''. September 28, 2007.</ref> U.S. District Court Judge Richard B. Austin mandated that three public housing units be built in white areas (less than 30% black) for every one unit built in black areas (more than 30% black).\n\nThese percentages have decreased since then and a wide array of programs have developed across the United States. While some programs have seen great successes, others have had difficulties in acquiring the land needed for construction and in maintaining new units.<ref name=\"Bass\">Bass, Sharon L \"Public Housing Entering New Era.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 5, 1989</ref> Eligibility requirements, generally based on household income and size, are common in these programs. In Dakota County, Minnesota, for example, eligibility ranges from a maximum of $51,550 for two people to $85,050 for 8-10 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dakotacda.org/ssph_program.htm |title=Dakota County Community Development Agency - Scattered Site Public Housing Program |publisher=Dakotacda.org |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905164931/http://www.dakotacda.org/ssph_program.htm |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nEligibility requirements are designed to ensure that those most in need receive relief first and that concerns regarding [[housing discrimination]] do not extend into the public housing sector.\n\n====Public policy and implications====\nScattered-site housing programs are generally run by the city housing authorities or local governments. They are intended to increase the availability of affordable housing and improve the quality of low-income housing, while avoiding problems associated with concentrated subsidized housing. Many scattered-site units are built to be similar in appearance to other homes in the neighborhood to somewhat mask the financial stature of tenants and reduce the stigma associated with public housing. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAn issue of great concern with regards to the implementation of scattered-site programs is where to construct these housing units and how to gain the support of the community. Frequent concerns of community members include potential decreases in the retail price of their home, a decline in neighborhood safety due to elevated levels of crime.<ref name=\"Bass\"/> Thus, one of the major concerns with the relocation of scattered-site tenants into white, middle-class neighborhoods is that residents will move elsewhere \u2013 a phenomenon known as [[white flight]]. To counter this phenomenon, some programs place tenants in private apartments that do not appear outwardly different. Despite these efforts, many members of middle-class, predominantly white neighborhoods have fought hard to keep public housing out of their communities.<ref name=\"Oldweiler\"/>\n\nAmerican sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] has proposed that concentrating low-income housing in impoverished areas can limit tenants' access to social opportunity.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/> Thus, some scattered-site programs now relocate tenants in middle-class suburban neighborhoods, hoping that immersion within social networks of greater financial stability will increase their social opportunities.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/> However, this strategy has not necessarily proved effective, especially with regards to boosting employment. When placed in neighborhoods of similar economic means, studies indicate that low-income residents use neighbors as social resources less often when living scattered throughout a neighborhood than when living in small clusters within a neighborhood.<ref name=\"evans.washington.edu\"/>\n\nThere are also concerns associated with the financial burden that these programs have on the state. Scattered-site housing provides no better living conditions for its tenants than traditional concentrated housing if the units are not properly maintained. There are questions as to whether or not scattered-site public facilities are more expensive to manage because dispersal throughout the city makes maintenance more difficult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pubasst/scatter.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202222030/http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/pubasst/scatter.html|url-status=dead|title=Scattered-Site Housing: Characteristics and Consequences &#124; HUD USER|archivedate=February 2, 2010|website=www.huduser.gov}}</ref>\n\n=== Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program ===\n[[Inclusionary zoning]] ordinances require housing developers to reserve a percentage between 10-30% of housing units from new or rehabilitated projects to be rented or sold at a below market rate for low and moderate-income households.

Gautreaux]] and the 1976 verdict mandated scattered-site housing for residents currently living in public housing in impoverished neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Oldweiler\"/>\n\nSince that time, scattered-site housing has become a major part of public housing in Chicago. In 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority created the Plan for Transformation designed to not only improve the structural aspects of public housing but to also \"build and strengthen communities by integrating public housing and its leaseholders into the larger social, economic, and physical fabric of Chicago\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecha.org/pages/scattered_site_properties/28.php |title=Scattered Site Properties &#124; Chicago Housing Authority |publisher=Thecha.org |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028024459/http://www.thecha.org/pages/scattered_site_properties/28.php |archivedate=2012-10-28 }}</ref> The goal is to have 25,000 new or remodeled units, and to have these units indistinguishable from surrounding housing.

She promised to do as he requested, but no sooner was her husband dead than she remarried and had her new husband made king instead of her son.  The [[Stepfamily#In fiction|stepfather]] was a wicked man and treated his stepson very cruelly.\n\nBy the castle, there was a brook that was of milk rather than water, which had plenty for everyone, but the new king forbade anyone to take the milk.  The guards noticed a gold-bearded man taking buckets of milk in the morning and then strangely vanishing.  The king came to see.  He wondered if he could ever capture such a man, and many attempts failed.  One day, an old soldier told him to leave bread, bacon, and drugged wine for the man; he would eat, drink, and fall asleep.  Then they could catch him.  The plan succeeded, and the king put the man in a cage.  After a month had passed, the king had to go to war.  He told his stepson to feed the man but not free him, or his fate would be terrible.\n\nThe prince accidentally shot an arrow into the cage, and the gold-bearded man refused to give it back unless he freed him.  After much pleading, the prince was convinced.  The gold-bearded man promised to repay him a thousand-fold and vanished.  The prince decided that running away could not be more dangerous than staying and left.  As he went along, he met a wood dove.  He was on the verge of shooting it when it implored him not to because its two children would starve.  He spared it, and the dove said that because of his act of mercy it would find a way to repay him.  The prince continued on, eventually meeting with a duck and then later a stork. Both times the same thing happened as had with the wood dove.\n\nHe met with two soldiers, and they traveled together in search of work.  A king hired the soldiers as coachmen and the prince as his companion.  The jealous soldiers told him the prince had claimed that if he were made the king's steward, he could ensure that no grain was lost from the king's store; if he set the prince to separate wheat and barley, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king had two enormous sacks mixed and ordered the prince to separate them.  The wood dove, who was the king of the wood doves, had his fellow doves sort them.  The king appointed him steward.\n\nThis made the soldiers more jealous.  They then told the king that the prince had claimed that were he in charge of the royal treasures, he would ensure that none were lost; if the king had a ring from the princess's finger thrown in the stream, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king did so, and the duck, who was the king of the ducks, had his ducks find it.  The king appointed him in charge of his treasures.\n\nThe soldiers now claimed that the prince had said he knew of a child who could speak every language and play every musical instrument.

The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. \n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, d\u00e9tail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&pg=PA7&dq=Realism+painting&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Realism%20painting&f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6\u20139, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0|978-3-8228-2942-4}}</ref><ref>Finocchio, Ross. \"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\".

It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\n[[File:Eyckbaptism.png|thumb|''Bas-de-page'' of the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', \"Hand G\" ([[Jan van Eyck]]?), [[Turin-Milan Hours]]. An advanced illusionistic work for c. 1425, with the dove of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the sky.]]\n\nThe art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].\n\n{{anchor|Naturalism}}\n\n===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===\n[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\n[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]\n\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Vel\u00e1zquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\n[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:El almuerzo, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg| [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'', c. 1620\nFile:Brouwer, Adriaen - Interior of a Tavern - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Interior of a Tavern'', c. 1630\nFile:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Interior of a Tailor's Shop - WGA03175.jpg|[[Quiringh van Brekelenkam]], ''Interior of a Tailor's Shop'', 1653\nFile:Giacomo Ceruti - Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School) - WGA4672.jpg|[[Giacomo Ceruti]], ''Women Working on Pillow Lace'', 1720s\nFile:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 017.jpg|[[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], ''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', c. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].<ref>Chardin served as a forerunner to the Realist movement in French painting. \"Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity\".

Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\n\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889]]\nA recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.<ref>Blunt, 30\u201332, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo</ref> [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,<ref>Blunt, 14\u201320</ref> with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful \u2013 he refused to make portraits for that reason.<ref>Blunt, 59\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905\u201306, ''[[Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve|Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of [[the Carracci]] and the \"naturalist\" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (''naturalisti'').<ref>\"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti\", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"'''Naturalist school'''\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\".<ref name=\"Needham\">Needham</ref> [[\u00c9mile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as \"Naturalist\", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Pieta z Lubiaza.jpg|Late Gothic ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' from [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] in [[Lower Silesia]], [[Poland]], now in National Museum in [[Warsaw]]\nFile:Raffaelli Pariser Vorstadt.JPG|[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], ''Outskirts of Paris'', 1880s\nFile:Fallen Monarchs 1886 by William Bliss Baker.jpg|[[William Bliss Baker]], American Naturalist painter, ''Fallen Monarchs'', 1886\nFile:Pekka Halonen - Tienraivaajia Karjalassa.jpg|[[Pekka Halonen]], [[Finland|Finnish]] Naturalist, ''Pioneers in [[Karelia]]'', 1900\n</gallery>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Literary realism}}\nBroadly defined as \"the faithful representation of reality\",<ref>{{cite web|author=Donna M.

A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]\n\n'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].\n\nIn the visual arts, [[illusionism (art)|illusionistic]] realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \"realist\" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. \n\n==Visual arts==\n[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, d\u00e9tail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&pg=PA7&dq=Realism+painting&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Realism%20painting&f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6\u20139, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0|978-3-8228-2942-4}}</ref><ref>Finocchio, Ross. \"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\".

It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\n[[File:Eyckbaptism.png|thumb|''Bas-de-page'' of the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', \"Hand G\" ([[Jan van Eyck]]?), [[Turin-Milan Hours]]. An advanced illusionistic work for c. 1425, with the dove of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the sky.]]\n\nThe art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].\n\n{{anchor|Naturalism}}\n\n===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===\n[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\n[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]\n\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Vel\u00e1zquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\n[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:El almuerzo, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg| [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'', c. 1620\nFile:Brouwer, Adriaen - Interior of a Tavern - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Interior of a Tavern'', c. 1630\nFile:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Interior of a Tailor's Shop - WGA03175.jpg|[[Quiringh van Brekelenkam]], ''Interior of a Tailor's Shop'', 1653\nFile:Giacomo Ceruti - Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School) - WGA4672.jpg|[[Giacomo Ceruti]], ''Women Working on Pillow Lace'', 1720s\nFile:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 017.jpg|[[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], ''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', c. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].<ref>Chardin served as a forerunner to the Realist movement in French painting. \"Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity\".

In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art.

Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\n\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889]]\nA recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.<ref>Blunt, 30\u201332, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo</ref> [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,<ref>Blunt, 14\u201320</ref> with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful \u2013 he refused to make portraits for that reason.<ref>Blunt, 59\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905\u201306, ''[[Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve|Matin \u00e0 Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of [[the Carracci]] and the \"naturalist\" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (''naturalisti'').<ref>\"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti\", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"'''Naturalist school'''\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\".<ref name=\"Needham\">Needham</ref> [[\u00c9mile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].

Castle Hill was the beloved home of [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Dr. Thomas Walker]] (1715\u20131794) and his wife, Mildred Thornton Meriwether (widow of Nicholas Meriwether III). Walker was a close friend and the physician of [[Peter Jefferson]], and later the guardian of young [[Thomas Jefferson]] after his father's death.\n\n== History ==\nThrough his marriage to Mildred Meriwether in 1741, Thomas Walker acquired the land comprising approximately {{convert|15000|acre}} which would become the site for Castle Hill. In its square hall, the youthful, music-loving Jefferson once played the violin, while the still younger Madison danced.  Here in 1781, Walker's wife delayed the British Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] to give the patriot [[Jack Jouett]] time to warn Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia legislators of Tarleton's plan to capture them.<ref>Richard Dillon, ''Meriwether Lewis: A Biography'' (Great West Books, Lafayette, CA, 2003), p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn addition to frequent visits by Thomas Jefferson, Castle Hill has entertained other U. S. Presidents and historic figures including [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[James Buchanan]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]].\n\nThe Walkers' youngest son, [[Francis Walker (Virginia)|Francis Walker]] (1764\u20131806), married Jane Byrd Nelson, the daughter of [[Thomas Nelson, Jr.|Governor Thomas Nelson]] of Yorktown, and inherited Castle Hill.  The estate was next inherited by Thomas & Mildred Walker's granddaughter, Judith Page Walker (1802\u20131882), who married U. S. Senator [[William Cabell Rives]] (1793\u20131868).  William Cabell Rives studied law under Thomas Jefferson at [[Monticello]], and was a friend of James Madison.  At Castle Hill, Rives wrote a three-volume biography on Madison, entitled ''The Life and Times of James Madison'' (Little Brown & Co., Boston, 1859, 1866, 1868).  A close friend of [[Dolley Madison]], Judith Rives authored the novel ''Home and the World'' (D. Appleton and Company, New York, 1857), in which she wrote of life at Castle Hill as the fictitious \u201cAvonmore.\u201d \n[[File:Castle Hill Albemarle County Virginia by Frances Benjamin Johnston.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of ''Castle Hill'' by the American photographer [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]].]]\n[[File:Entrance to Castle Hill.jpg|left|thumb|Entrance to Castle Hill]]\nColonel Alfred Landon Rives (1830\u20131903), son of William and Judith Rives, and chief of engineers to General Robert E. Lee during the [[American Civil War]], inherited Castle Hill.  After Rives died in 1903, and his widow, Sarah Catherine MacMurdo Rives, died in 1909, their daughter, [[Am\u00e9lie Rives Troubetzkoy|Am\u00e9lie Louise Rives Troubetzkoy]] (1863\u20131945), prominent romantic novelist, early feminist, and wife of artist, [[Pierre Troubetzkoy|Russian Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy]] (1864\u20131936), inherited the property.  At least three of Am\u00e9lie's novels, ''Virginia of Virginia'' (Harper & Brothers, New York, 1888), ''The Quick or the Dead?'' (J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1888), and ''Barbara Dering'' (J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893), are drawn from life at Castle Hill.  Am\u00e9lie and Castle Hill were both featured in a New York Times article published on April 15, 1906.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Am\u00e9lie's sister, Mrs. Gertrude Rives Potts, who managed the estate after their father's death, was recognized as the first woman [[Master of Foxhounds]].  While at Castle Hill, Gertrude imported and trained a pack of English Foxhounds, bred and schooled her own horses, organized a hunting staff, and enlisted the consent of neighboring landowners to form a suitable country for the \u201cCastle Hill Hounds.\u201d Castle Hill later became part of the Keswick Hunt Club district.\n\n== Architecture ==\n [[File:Castle Hill (1824 Rives Addition).jpg|left|thumb|Castle Hill (1824 Rives Addition)]] The original clapboard, colonial residence was built by Walker in 1764, with a front porch facing west and six dormer windows. William and Judith Rives added the brick, federal style addition to the home in 1824, which was built by Captain John Perry, one of Thomas Jefferson's master brickmasons.  In 1844 the home's columned conservatories were added to each end of Perry's addition by another Jefferson brickmason, William B. Phillips.\n\n== Gardens ==\n[[File:Castle Hill Formal Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|Castle Hill's Formal Gardens]]\n[[File:The Gardens at Castle Hill.JPG|right|thumb|The Gardens at Castle Hill]]\nCastle Hill's formal gardens were featured in an article written by Gertrude Potts published in the ''Historic Gardens of Virginia'' (The James River Garden Club, Richmond, 1923).  The great box-hedges which stand at the top of the gardens are considered to be some of the tallest and most impressive boxwood in Virginia.  The current expanded, multi-terraced and symmetrical formal gardens were designed in 1997 by [[Landscape architect]] Rachel M.

Castle Hill was the beloved home of [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Dr. Thomas Walker]] (1715\u20131794) and his wife, Mildred Thornton Meriwether (widow of Nicholas Meriwether III). Walker was a close friend and the physician of [[Peter Jefferson]], and later the guardian of young [[Thomas Jefferson]] after his father's death.\n\n== History ==\nThrough his marriage to Mildred Meriwether in 1741, Thomas Walker acquired the land comprising approximately {{convert|15000|acre}} which would become the site for Castle Hill. In its square hall, the youthful, music-loving Jefferson once played the violin, while the still younger Madison danced.  Here in 1781, Walker's wife delayed the British Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] to give the patriot [[Jack Jouett]] time to warn Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia legislators of Tarleton's plan to capture them.<ref>Richard Dillon, ''Meriwether Lewis: A Biography'' (Great West Books, Lafayette, CA, 2003), p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn addition to frequent visits by Thomas Jefferson, Castle Hill has entertained other U. S. Presidents and historic figures including [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[James Buchanan]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]].\n\nThe Walkers' youngest son, [[Francis Walker (Virginia)|Francis Walker]] (1764\u20131806), married Jane Byrd Nelson, the daughter of [[Thomas Nelson, Jr.|Governor Thomas Nelson]] of Yorktown, and inherited Castle Hill.  The estate was next inherited by Thomas & Mildred Walker's granddaughter, Judith Page Walker (1802\u20131882), who married U. S. Senator [[William Cabell Rives]] (1793\u20131868).  William Cabell Rives studied law under Thomas Jefferson at [[Monticello]], and was a friend of James Madison.  At Castle Hill, Rives wrote a three-volume biography on Madison, entitled ''The Life and Times of James Madison'' (Little Brown & Co., Boston, 1859, 1866, 1868).  A close friend of [[Dolley Madison]], Judith Rives authored the novel ''Home and the World'' (D. Appleton and Company, New York, 1857), in which she wrote of life at Castle Hill as the fictitious \u201cAvonmore.\u201d \n[[File:Castle Hill Albemarle County Virginia by Frances Benjamin Johnston.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of ''Castle Hill'' by the American photographer [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]].]]\n[[File:Entrance to Castle Hill.jpg|left|thumb|Entrance to Castle Hill]]\nColonel Alfred Landon Rives (1830\u20131903), son of William and Judith Rives, and chief of engineers to General Robert E. Lee during the [[American Civil War]], inherited Castle Hill.  After Rives died in 1903, and his widow, Sarah Catherine MacMurdo Rives, died in 1909, their daughter, [[Am\u00e9lie Rives Troubetzkoy|Am\u00e9lie Louise Rives Troubetzkoy]] (1863\u20131945), prominent romantic novelist, early feminist, and wife of artist, [[Pierre Troubetzkoy|Russian Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy]] (1864\u20131936), inherited the property.  At least three of Am\u00e9lie's novels, ''Virginia of Virginia'' (Harper & Brothers, New York, 1888), ''The Quick or the Dead?'' (J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1888), and ''Barbara Dering'' (J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893), are drawn from life at Castle Hill.  Am\u00e9lie and Castle Hill were both featured in a New York Times article published on April 15, 1906.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Am\u00e9lie's sister, Mrs. Gertrude Rives Potts, who managed the estate after their father's death, was recognized as the first woman [[Master of Foxhounds]].  While at Castle Hill, Gertrude imported and trained a pack of English Foxhounds, bred and schooled her own horses, organized a hunting staff, and enlisted the consent of neighboring landowners to form a suitable country for the \u201cCastle Hill Hounds.\u201d Castle Hill later became part of the Keswick Hunt Club district.\n\n== Architecture ==\n [[File:Castle Hill (1824 Rives Addition).jpg|left|thumb|Castle Hill (1824 Rives Addition)]] The original clapboard, colonial residence was built by Walker in 1764, with a front porch facing west and six dormer windows. William and Judith Rives added the brick, federal style addition to the home in 1824, which was built by Captain John Perry, one of Thomas Jefferson's master brickmasons.  In 1844 the home's columned conservatories were added to each end of Perry's addition by another Jefferson brickmason, William B. Phillips.\n\n== Gardens ==\n[[File:Castle Hill Formal Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|Castle Hill's Formal Gardens]]\n[[File:The Gardens at Castle Hill.JPG|right|thumb|The Gardens at Castle Hill]]\nCastle Hill's formal gardens were featured in an article written by Gertrude Potts published in the ''Historic Gardens of Virginia'' (The James River Garden Club, Richmond, 1923).  The great box-hedges which stand at the top of the gardens are considered to be some of the tallest and most impressive boxwood in Virginia.  The current expanded, multi-terraced and symmetrical formal gardens were designed in 1997 by [[Landscape architect]] Rachel M. Lily.\n\n==Today==\nCurrently, Castle Hill is being used to host seasonal retreats with some of today's most renowned authors. Upcoming retreats welcome notable members such as John Grisham, Sissy Spacek, Jan Karon, and Hugh Wilson.<ref name=\"Castle Hill Readers and Writers Retreats\">{{cite web|title=Castle Hill Readers and Writers Retreats|url=http://castlehillretreats.com/}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Thomas Walker (Explorer)]]\n*[[William Cabell Rives]]\n*[[Am\u00e9lie Rives Troubetzkoy]]\n*[[Julia Magruder]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* K.
