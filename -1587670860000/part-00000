Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nLaunched six months before the Golf, in order to resolve any teething troubles before production of the high volume hatchback started,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk/index.php?p=1_5_Scirocco-Timeline |title=Scirocco Timeline |publisher=Sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> the Scirocco went on sale in Europe in 1974 and in North America in 1975. Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. Many European owners of Scirocco with smaller engines often replaced the rectangle headlamps with four round headlights as to eliminate the differentiation between smaller and less powerful engines and larger and more powerful ones.  However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January\u2013February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.\n[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]\n\nHalfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. \n\nEleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN.

In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models.

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years.

Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. \n\nEleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = B\u00f6hler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vern\u00fcnftig.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Mk3|13}}Third generation (2008\u20132017)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = VW Scirocco III 2.0 TSI DSG Collectors Edition 54 von 100 Oryxwei\u00df.JPG\n| production = 2008\u20132017\n| assembly = Portugal: [[Palmela]] ([[AutoEuropa]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 platform]]\n| engine = 1.4 L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|petrol]])<br />2.0 L I4 (petrol)<br />2.0 L I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]])<br />7-speed automatic (DSG)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2578|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4256|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1404|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|2862|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}-{{convert|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]]<br />[[Volkswagen Eos]]<br />[[SEAT Le\u00f3n]] Mk2\n| predecessor = [[Volkswagen Corrado]]\n| designer = [[Walter de Silva]]<br />Marc Lichte\n}}\n\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco 2008 67 (8451971989).jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre-facelift Scirocco (Europe)]]\nVolkswagen officially announced in June 2006 production of a new Scirocco model at the [[AutoEuropa]] assembly plant in [[Palmela]], Portugal.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{\ncite news\n|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/Unternehmen/Industrie/pshb/fn/relhbi/sfn/buildhbi/cn/GoArt!200012,200038,1095675/SH/0/depot/0/neuer-vw-scirocco-kommt-aus-portugal.html\n|publisher=Handelsblatt\n|title=Neuer VW Scirocco kommt aus Portugal\n|trans-title=New VW Scirocco to come from Portugal\n|date=June 20, 2006\n|language=german\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n{{anchor|Iroc}}\n\nThe new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]].

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

Route&nbsp;15 consists of four distinct sections: the [[Merritt Parkway]], the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], the [[Berlin Turnpike]], and part of the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]]. The unified designation was applied to these separate highways in 1948 to provide a continuous through route from New York to Massachusetts.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Merritt Parkway===\n\n[[File:Entering the Merritt Parkway in Greenwich.jpg|thumb|left|Signage at the state line in Greenwich]]\nRoute 15 begins at the [[New York (state)|New York]] border, where the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] continues southwest towards [[New York, New York|New York City]], at the [[New York State Route 120A]] interchange in the village of [[Rye Brook, New York|Rye Brook]], in the town of [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]]. The highway comes into the state of Connecticut, continuing as the [[Merritt Parkway]], a four lane limited-access parkway with low bridges, sharp curves, and a tree-filled median, that passes through the affluent urbanized areas of southern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on this section of Route 15. The parkway heads into the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], where it passes a service plaza in both directions, curves north-northwest, before heading north-northeast and meeting interchanges at Round Hill Road providing access to Downtown Greenwich and at Lake Avenue. From there, Route 15 turns northeast, and reverse turns through its interchange with North Street, which provides another outlet into Downtown Greenwich. Past this interchange, the parkway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], where it crosses over the [[Mianus River]] within the [[Mianus River State Park]], before reaching an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 104|Route 104]] in the residential areas of [[North Stamford]], providing access to [[Downtown Stamford]] and the [[University of Connecticut]] Stamford Campus.

Afterwards, Route 15 passes under the New Canaan Branch and curves around to meet an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 124|Route 124]] before reaching the New Canaan Service Plaza. After crossing the Fivemile River, the parkway enters the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and immediately comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 123|Route 123]], which provides access to the [[Norwalk Community College]]. Just past its crossing of the [[Silvermine River]], Route 15 meets the [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) freeway at an incomplete interchange before it crosses over the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line just south of the [[Merritt 7 station]], and the [[Norwalk River]] and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Main Avenue which provides the missing movements between the parkway and US 7. From there, Route 15 continues northeast through residential areas in the neighborhood of [[Cranbury (Norwalk)|Cranbury]] before it leaves Norwalk, after crossing over [[Connecticut Route 53|Route 53]] without an interchange.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CT15sRoad-Exit44-CT58 (39144462790).jpg|thumb|right|Merritt Parkway in Fairfield]]\nThe parkway enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], where it crosses over the [[Saugatuck River]], and comes to right-in/right-out interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]], just east of the town line. Route 15 turns to the northeast again, upon reaching its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 57|Route 57]], that has a park and ride lot serving the town of Westport in its northwest corner. Immediately after this interchange, the parkway crosses over [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]] with no access and enters its longest stretch without exits, where it passes more wooded residential areas and comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], where it meets its next interchange, five and a half miles later, at [[Connecticut Route 58|Route 58]], which also has a park and ride lot, located in its southeastern corner. Route 58 provides access to both [[Fairfield Center]] and the campus of [[Fairfield University]]. Route 15 crosses the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]], passes service plazas in both directions, and then meets [[Connecticut Route 59|Route 59]] at a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Route 59 provides access to the headquarters of [[General Electric]]. The parkway turns east-northeast and enters the town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] at its interchange with Park Avenue, which provides access to the campus of [[Sacred Heart University]] just to the southwest of the road, as well as the campus of the [[University of Bridgeport]] in the adjacent city of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Route 15 then reaches a single-point urban interchange with [[Connecticut Route 111|Route 111]], adjacent to the [[Westfield Trumbull]] shopping mall, in its southwestern corner. The parkway meets the [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] freeway at an incomplete turbine interchange, which provides access to the [[Beardsley Zoo]] in Bridgeport, and the route crosses the [[Pequonnock River]] within the interchange. Past Route 25, Route 15 reaches a southbound exit and northbound entrance for [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] and then a full interchange for [[Connecticut Route 108|Route 108]], in tandem with stack interchange with the [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] freeway.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nRoute 15 comes into the town of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] through more wooded suburban areas, and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]] at the northeastern edge of town. Past this interchange, the parkway runs due east to cross the [[Igor Sikorsky Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] where it leaves both Stratford and Fairfield County. Route 15 enters both [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] and [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], coming to a modified trumpet interchange with the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]] which provides access to both the [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] freeway and [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], north of Downtown Milford. At this point, the Merritt Parkway ends and Route 15 turns northeast again through the wooded residential areas of southwestern New Haven County.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Wilbur Cross Parkway===\n\nThe next component of Route 15, the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], begins at the Milford Parkway junction. The Wilbur Cross Parkway follows the same general configuration and landscape as the Merritt Parkway, continues with the Merritt Parkway's exit numbers, and excludes commerical vehicles from its use, too. A few miles after the Milford Parkway, the parkway comes into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it passes a bi-directional service plaza, and meets [[Connecticut Route 121|Route 121]] at a pair of right-in/right-out ramps, which provides access to the Orange campus of the [[University of New Haven]]. Now running north-northeast, Route 15 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] which provides access eastbound to the [[Yale Bowl]], in the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. The parkway crosses the Wepawaug River, where it turns northeast and enters the town of [[Woodbridge, Connecticut|Woodbridge]], passing under [[Connecticut Route 114|Route 114]] without access. Route 15 agains crosses a boundary and comes into New Haven, where it meets an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 69|Route 69]]/[[Connecticut Route 63|Route 63]] that provides access to the campus of [[Southern Connecticut State University]], in the neighborhood of [[Amity (New Haven)|Amity]], crossing the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] within the interchange.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CrossParkwayExit59NB.jpg|thumb|left|Wilbur Cross Parkway approaching Heroes Tunnel]]\nFrom here, the parkway briefly crosses back through the southeastern corner of Woodbridge, before coming back into New Haven, and entering [[Heroes Tunnel]] which passes under [[West Rock Ridge]]. Immediately after exiting the tunnel, Route 15 comes into the town of [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], where it heads into a mix of residential and commercial areas around its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], that also provides access to the [[Paier College of Art]]. The parkway then enters the town of [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]], where it crosses the [[Mill River (Connecticut)|Mill River]] and passes under the [[Connecticut Route 40|Route 40]] freeway as the only freeway crosspath in the state without an interchange, over [[East Rock]]. A short distance later, the parkway meets an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 22|Route 22]] and continues northeast to the last pair of service plazas on the route. Past the plazas, Route 15 turns north-northeast along the western edge of the [[Quinnipiac River State Park]], where the route enters the town of [[Wallingford, Connecticut|Wallingford]]. In Wallingford, the parkway has exits to Quinnipiac Street providing access to Gaylord Specialty Healthcare and the [[Wallingford station (Connecticut)|Wallingford station]] on [[Amtrak]] and [[ConnDOT]]'s [[Hartford Line]], as well as [[Connecticut Route 150|Route 150]] that provides access to the Masonicare Health Center. Route 15 crosses the [[Quinnipiac River]] and turns northeast, where it comes to an interchange for [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]], where it also crosses the Hartford Line.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nRoute 15 continues northeast into the city of [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and passes entrances to the ConnDOT maintenance facilities. The parkway continues a short distance before reaching an interchange complex on the east side of town. First, Route 15 crosses over the [[Interstate 91|I-91]] freeway, where it turns north to reach a southbound exit and northbound entrance, before meeting East Main Street, which provides access to the [[Wesleyan University]] campus, where the Interstate Highway begins to run inside the median. The parkway widens to six lanes through here, then reaches the next exits for northbound I-91 with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrance to and from the westbound direction of the [[Interstate 691|I-691]] freeway, where there is also access from westbound I-691 to the northbound Wilbur Cross Parkway. Past I-691, Route 15 narrows back to four lanes, and turns north-northwest before heading north-northeast again, where the Wilbur Cross Parkway ends and northbound US 5 merges with northbound Route 15 to head toward the suburban areas of [[Greater Hartford]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Berlin Turnpike===\n[[File:Berlin Turnpike.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin Turnpike]]\nRoute 15 continues onto a four-lane divided surface highway concurrent with US 5, known as the [[Berlin Turnpike]], running between Silver Lake to the west and [[Lamentation Mountain]] to the east. Here it passes along a commercial strip, before passing areas of residence. The highway enters the city of [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]] and [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], and briefly forms the western edge of [[Lamentation Mountain State Park]], before heading back into commercial areas. An old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike, splits to the west, while US 5/Route 15 reverse curve to their interchange with the [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] freeway and [[Connecticut Route 372|Route 372]] in which all access besides the ramps from US 5/Route 15 to southbound Route 9 and from Southbound Route 9 to US 5/Route 15 is made via Route 372. North of Route 9, the old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike rejoins the new road briefly, before splitting again, this time to the east. The highway crosses the [[Mattabesset River]] before intersecting the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 160|Route 160]]. US 5/Route 15 passes rows of shopping centers, as it comes into the town of [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], insecting the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 173|Route 173]], which heads north towards the town of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. The highway continues to its junction with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 176|Route 176]], which heads north towards the center of Newington. A park and ride lot is located in the northeastern corner of this intersection, with Griswoldville Avenue. From here, US 5/Route 15 passes the ConnDOT headquarters on the east, prior to reaching the intersections with [[Connecticut Route 287|Route 287]]. The highway leaves Newington at its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 175|Route 175]], which heads west towards the center of town and east towards the town of [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nAfter the Route 175 interchange, US 5/Route 15 enters Wethersfield and passes more commercial areas before reaching the partial interchange with [[Connecticut Route 314|Route 314]]. The Berlin Turnpike splits and continues north-northeast along Route 314, narrowing to a two-lane undivided road, until it reaches the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] city line, continuing into that city as Maple Avenue. US 5/Route 15 exits onto a four-lane freeway that heads northeast towards I-91 as a limited-access outlet into Hartford.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Wilbur Cross Highway===\n\nPast Route 314, US 5/Route 15 continue onto the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]], a four-lane freeway with a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle. The highway passes through wooded urbanized areas, to the southeast of the Connecticut Department of Labor headquarters, before it comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 99|Route 99]], in which the overpass that carries the two routes over that route and the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]]'s [[Connecticut Valley Railroad]] line is called the [[Clinton \"Jiggs\" Hughes Memorial Bridge]]. Next, US 5/Route 15 comes into Hartford, turns north-northeast at an interchange with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], where there are ramps from northbound and southbound US 5/Route 15 to southbound I-91, and from northbound I-91 to northbound I-91 to southbound US 5/Route 15. The next interchange at Brainard Road/Airport Road with access to [[Hartford-Brainard Airport]], has no southbound exit. The highway continues through industrial areas and comes exits from the southbound Wilbur Cross Highway to Southbound I-91, as well as an exit from the northbound Wilbur Cross Highway and northbound I-91 that also provides access to westbound [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania-Massachusetts)|I-84]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CT15sRoad-Exit90-US5n-Exit86-Int91-ButtonCopy (32247253503).jpg|thumb|left|Route&nbsp;15 southbound in Hartford]]\nFrom here, US 5/Route 15 cross over the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Charter Oak Bridge]], where the routes enter the town of [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]]. On the other side of the bridge, there is an interchange serving [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]], where northbound US 5 splits and exits Route 15 onto Main Street, which runs north through the center of East Hartford. Route 15 reverse curves to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Silver Lane, before the highway reaches its northern terminus and merges onto eastbound I-84 and [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]]. A dedicated connection also exists between Route 15 and I-84/US 6's high-occupany vehicle lanes. The Wilbur Cross Highway continues northeast along I-84 towards [[Interstate 90]]/[[Massachusetts Turnpike]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"google\" /><ref name=ctlog>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf |title=Connecticut State Highway Log (2006) |access-date=May 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927215816/http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=restrictions>Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles: [http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=810&q=310268&dmvNavDLTEST=|27862  Registering a Pick-up Truck with Passenger Plates]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Route&nbsp;15 designation was created as part of the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]] and originally ran from [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] through [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] and [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line in [[Union, Connecticut|Union]].<ref name=\"1932renum\" /> The original route used the pre-expressway alignment of modern [[Route 17 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;17]] to [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]], Main Street to East Hartford center, [[U.S. Route 5 (Connecticut)|U.S.&nbsp;Route 5]] to the junction with [[Route 30 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;30]], then modern Route&nbsp;30 to [[Stafford, Connecticut|Stafford]], then modern [[Route 190 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;190]] to Union, and modern [[Route 171 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;171]] to the Massachusetts state line.<ref name=kurumi>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct15.html kurumi.com - Route 15]</ref>\n\nIn 1943, a newly constructed two-lane highway (now the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]]) between [[Tolland, Connecticut|Tolland]] and Union was opened to traffic. Route&nbsp;15 was relocated on this new highway and the former Route&nbsp;15 between [[Route 74 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;74]] and [[Route 190 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;190]] (then part of [[Route 20 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;20]]) was redesignated as Route&nbsp;30. By 1948, the rest of the old two-lane Wilbur Cross Highway to East Hartford had also opened, connecting to the [[Charter Oak Bridge]] and the [[Hartford Bypass]]. In 1948, the State Highway Department decided to relocate Route&nbsp;15 to a series of roadways, namely the [[Merritt Parkway]], [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], [[Berlin Turnpike]], Hartford Bypass, Charter Oak Bridge, and the new Wilbur Cross Highway, creating a modern, high-speed throughway from the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line to the Massachusetts state line. The Route&nbsp;15 designation was applied to the previously unnumbered parkways from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], then overlaid with U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;5 through East Hartford, then designated on the southern half of the Wilbur Cross Highway to Tolland, connecting with the portion previously designated as Route&nbsp;15 five years before. The former Route&nbsp;15 between South Windsor and Tolland was reassigned as an extension of Route&nbsp;30, and the former Route&nbsp;15 between New Haven and Glastonbury became redesignated as Route&nbsp;17.<ref name=kurumi/><ref name=larned/>\n\nIn 1948, a portion of the Wilbur Cross Parkway between [[Route 34 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;34]] and Whitney Avenue had still been under construction. Route&nbsp;15 was temporarily routed along Route&nbsp;34, Sherman Avenue (former Routes 5 and 10), Henry Street/Munson Street/Hillside Place/Edwards Street (former Route&nbsp;5), and Whitney Avenue (former Route&nbsp;10A). By 1949, the Wilbur Cross Parkway was completed and the temporary Route&nbsp;15 designation was removed from the surface streets. Further improvements in the Wilbur Cross Highway took place over the next several years and the road became a four-lane divided highway by 1954. In 1968, most of the Wilbur Cross Highway was designated as [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-86]] and further upgrades to the road were implemented. Route&nbsp;15 and I-86 overlapped from the current 15/84 junction in East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line. In 1984, the overlap was removed, truncating Route&nbsp;15 to its current northern end, while at the same time I-86 was redesignated as I-84.<ref name=larned>Larry Larned, \"Route 15: The Road to Hartford\", (Arcadia Publishing, 2002)</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=routelog>{{cite web |url=https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DOT/documents/dpolicy/traflog/TrafficLog12pdf.pdf |title=2012 Traffic Volumes, State Maintained Highway Network |author=State of Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=25\n|location=Greenwich\n|lspan=5\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|Parkway|Hutchinson River|dir1=south|to2=to|location1=[[New York City]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]; exit numbers continue south along Hutchinson Parkway\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=27\n|mile=0.05\n|road={{Jct|state=NY|NY|120A|dir1=north|name1=King Street|location1=[[Armonk, NY]]}}\n|notes=Access to NY 120A south via Hutchinson Parkway exit 30S\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=28\n|mile=3.39\n|road=Round Hill Road\n|notes=To Greenwich Business District\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=29\n|mile=4.16\n|road=Lake Avenue\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=31\n|mile=5.71\n|road=North Street\n|notes=To Greenwich Business District\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=3\n|exit=33\n|mile=8.89\n|road=Den Road\n|notes=[[Right-in/right-out]] interchange\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=34\n|mile=9.22\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|104|name1=Long Ridge Road}}\n|notes=To Downtown Stamford and [[University of Connecticut]] Stamford Campus\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=35\n|mile=10.40\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|137|name1=High Ridge Road}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=New Canaan\n|lspan=2\n|exit=36\n|mile=13.15\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|106|name1=Old Stamford Road}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=37\n|mile=13.89\n|mile2=14.10\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|124|city1=New Canaan|city2=Darien}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Norwalk\n|lspan=3\n|exit=38\n|mile=16.01\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|123|name1=New Canaan Avenue}}\n|notes=To [[Norwalk Community College]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=39\n|mile=16.87\n|mile2=17.31\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|7|city1=Norwalk|city2=Danbury}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance; signed as exits 39A (south) and 39B (north); redesign in proposal stage<ref name=7-15Norwalk>{{cite news|title=Route 7/15 Norwalk Project|url=http://7-15norwalk.com/|accessdate=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328030115/http://7-15norwalk.com/|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=40\n|mile=17.53\n|mile2=17.63\n|road={{jct|state=CT|road|Main Avenue|US|7|to2=yes|city1=Norwalk|city2=Danbury}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 40A (south) and 40B (north); no northbound signage for US 7\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Westport\n|lspan=2\n|exit=41\n|mile=20.73\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|33|city1=Westport|city2=Wilton}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=42\n|mile=21.59\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|57|city1=Westport|city2=Weston}}\n}} \n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Fairfield\n|lspan=2\n|exit=44\n|mile=26.95\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|58|city1=Fairfield|city2=Redding}}\n|notes=To Fairfield Business District and [[Fairfield University]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=46\n|mile=28.58\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|59|city1=Fairfield|city2=Easton}}\n|notes=To [[General Electric]] Headquarters\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Trumbull\n|lspan=7\n|exit=47\n|mile=29.31\n|road=Park Avenue \n|notes=To [[University of Bridgeport]] and [[Sacred Heart University]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=48\n|mile=30.37\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|111|name1=Main Street|location1=[[Long Hill, Trumbull, Connecticut|Long Hill]]|city2=Monroe}}\n|notes=[[Single-point urban interchange]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=49S\n|mile=31.64\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=CT|CT|25|dir1=south|CT|8|dir2=south|to2=yes|city1=Bridgeport}}\n|notes=No southbound exit; exit 7A on (Route 25) northbound\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=32.69\n|exit=49N\n|road={{jct|state=CT|CT|25|dir1=north|city1=Danbury}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 49 southbound; exit 8A and B on (Route 25) southbound\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=50\n|mile=32.99\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|127|city1=Trumbull}}\n|notes=Southbound exit and northbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=51\n|mile=33.51\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|108|name1=Nichols Avenue}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=52\n|mile=33.77\n|mile2=34.57\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|8|CT|108|city1=Bridgeport|city2=Waterbury|to2=yes}}\n|notes=No northbound exit to Route 8 southbound; signed as exit 9 northbound and 10 southbound on Route 8\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stratford\n|exit=53\n|mile=36.54\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|110|city1=Stratford|city2=Shelton}}\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|river=[[Housatonic River]]\n|mile=37.53\n|bridge=[[Igor I.

Route&nbsp;15 consists of four distinct sections: the [[Merritt Parkway]], the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], the [[Berlin Turnpike]], and part of the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]]. The unified designation was applied to these separate highways in 1948 to provide a continuous through route from New York to Massachusetts.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Merritt Parkway===\n\n[[File:Entering the Merritt Parkway in Greenwich.jpg|thumb|left|Signage at the state line in Greenwich]]\nRoute 15 begins at the [[New York (state)|New York]] border, where the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] continues southwest towards [[New York, New York|New York City]], at the [[New York State Route 120A]] interchange in the village of [[Rye Brook, New York|Rye Brook]], in the town of [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]]. The highway comes into the state of Connecticut, continuing as the [[Merritt Parkway]], a four lane limited-access parkway with low bridges, sharp curves, and a tree-filled median, that passes through the affluent urbanized areas of southern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on this section of Route 15. The parkway heads into the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], where it passes a service plaza in both directions, curves north-northwest, before heading north-northeast and meeting interchanges at Round Hill Road providing access to Downtown Greenwich and at Lake Avenue. From there, Route 15 turns northeast, and reverse turns through its interchange with North Street, which provides another outlet into Downtown Greenwich. Past this interchange, the parkway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], where it crosses over the [[Mianus River]] within the [[Mianus River State Park]], before reaching an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 104|Route 104]] in the residential areas of [[North Stamford]], providing access to [[Downtown Stamford]] and the [[University of Connecticut]] Stamford Campus. Route 15 continues to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 137|Route 137]] before the route leaves Stamford.<ref name=\"google\">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/41.0365193,-73.675626/41.7651509,-72.6268662/@41.3729007,-74.0035743,299773m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-72.7333157!2d41.6412733!3s0x89e7b369fe6d8a6d:0x90877653b0f75b5!1m0!3e0|title=overview of Connecticut Route 15|access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe parkway comes into the town of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], where it crosses the [[Noroton River]] within its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]], adjacent to the [[Talmadge Hill station]] on the [[New Canaan Branch]] of the [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]], located to the southeast of the interchange. Afterwards, Route 15 passes under the New Canaan Branch and curves around to meet an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 124|Route 124]] before reaching the New Canaan Service Plaza. After crossing the Fivemile River, the parkway enters the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and immediately comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 123|Route 123]], which provides access to the [[Norwalk Community College]]. Just past its crossing of the [[Silvermine River]], Route 15 meets the [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) freeway at an incomplete interchange before it crosses over the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line just south of the [[Merritt 7 station]], and the [[Norwalk River]] and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Main Avenue which provides the missing movements between the parkway and US 7. From there, Route 15 continues northeast through residential areas in the neighborhood of [[Cranbury (Norwalk)|Cranbury]] before it leaves Norwalk, after crossing over [[Connecticut Route 53|Route 53]] without an interchange.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CT15sRoad-Exit44-CT58 (39144462790).jpg|thumb|right|Merritt Parkway in Fairfield]]\nThe parkway enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], where it crosses over the [[Saugatuck River]], and comes to right-in/right-out interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]], just east of the town line. Route 15 turns to the northeast again, upon reaching its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 57|Route 57]], that has a park and ride lot serving the town of Westport in its northwest corner. Immediately after this interchange, the parkway crosses over [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]] with no access and enters its longest stretch without exits, where it passes more wooded residential areas and comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], where it meets its next interchange, five and a half miles later, at [[Connecticut Route 58|Route 58]], which also has a park and ride lot, located in its southeastern corner. Route 58 provides access to both [[Fairfield Center]] and the campus of [[Fairfield University]]. Route 15 crosses the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]], passes service plazas in both directions, and then meets [[Connecticut Route 59|Route 59]] at a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Route 59 provides access to the headquarters of [[General Electric]]. The parkway turns east-northeast and enters the town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] at its interchange with Park Avenue, which provides access to the campus of [[Sacred Heart University]] just to the southwest of the road, as well as the campus of the [[University of Bridgeport]] in the adjacent city of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Route 15 then reaches a single-point urban interchange with [[Connecticut Route 111|Route 111]], adjacent to the [[Westfield Trumbull]] shopping mall, in its southwestern corner. The parkway meets the [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] freeway at an incomplete turbine interchange, which provides access to the [[Beardsley Zoo]] in Bridgeport, and the route crosses the [[Pequonnock River]] within the interchange. Past Route 25, Route 15 reaches a southbound exit and northbound entrance for [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] and then a full interchange for [[Connecticut Route 108|Route 108]], in tandem with stack interchange with the [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] freeway.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nRoute 15 comes into the town of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] through more wooded suburban areas, and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]] at the northeastern edge of town. Past this interchange, the parkway runs due east to cross the [[Igor Sikorsky Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] where it leaves both Stratford and Fairfield County. Route 15 enters both [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] and [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], coming to a modified trumpet interchange with the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]] which provides access to both the [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] freeway and [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], north of Downtown Milford. At this point, the Merritt Parkway ends and Route 15 turns northeast again through the wooded residential areas of southwestern New Haven County.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Wilbur Cross Parkway===\n\nThe next component of Route 15, the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], begins at the Milford Parkway junction. The Wilbur Cross Parkway follows the same general configuration and landscape as the Merritt Parkway, continues with the Merritt Parkway's exit numbers, and excludes commerical vehicles from its use, too. A few miles after the Milford Parkway, the parkway comes into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it passes a bi-directional service plaza, and meets [[Connecticut Route 121|Route 121]] at a pair of right-in/right-out ramps, which provides access to the Orange campus of the [[University of New Haven]]. Now running north-northeast, Route 15 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] which provides access eastbound to the [[Yale Bowl]], in the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. The parkway crosses the Wepawaug River, where it turns northeast and enters the town of [[Woodbridge, Connecticut|Woodbridge]], passing under [[Connecticut Route 114|Route 114]] without access. Route 15 agains crosses a boundary and comes into New Haven, where it meets an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 69|Route 69]]/[[Connecticut Route 63|Route 63]] that provides access to the campus of [[Southern Connecticut State University]], in the neighborhood of [[Amity (New Haven)|Amity]], crossing the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] within the interchange.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CrossParkwayExit59NB.jpg|thumb|left|Wilbur Cross Parkway approaching Heroes Tunnel]]\nFrom here, the parkway briefly crosses back through the southeastern corner of Woodbridge, before coming back into New Haven, and entering [[Heroes Tunnel]] which passes under [[West Rock Ridge]]. Immediately after exiting the tunnel, Route 15 comes into the town of [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], where it heads into a mix of residential and commercial areas around its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], that also provides access to the [[Paier College of Art]]. The parkway then enters the town of [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]], where it crosses the [[Mill River (Connecticut)|Mill River]] and passes under the [[Connecticut Route 40|Route 40]] freeway as the only freeway crosspath in the state without an interchange, over [[East Rock]]. A short distance later, the parkway meets an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 22|Route 22]] and continues northeast to the last pair of service plazas on the route. Past the plazas, Route 15 turns north-northeast along the western edge of the [[Quinnipiac River State Park]], where the route enters the town of [[Wallingford, Connecticut|Wallingford]]. In Wallingford, the parkway has exits to Quinnipiac Street providing access to Gaylord Specialty Healthcare and the [[Wallingford station (Connecticut)|Wallingford station]] on [[Amtrak]] and [[ConnDOT]]'s [[Hartford Line]], as well as [[Connecticut Route 150|Route 150]] that provides access to the Masonicare Health Center. Route 15 crosses the [[Quinnipiac River]] and turns northeast, where it comes to an interchange for [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]], where it also crosses the Hartford Line.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nRoute 15 continues northeast into the city of [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and passes entrances to the ConnDOT maintenance facilities. The parkway continues a short distance before reaching an interchange complex on the east side of town. First, Route 15 crosses over the [[Interstate 91|I-91]] freeway, where it turns north to reach a southbound exit and northbound entrance, before meeting East Main Street, which provides access to the [[Wesleyan University]] campus, where the Interstate Highway begins to run inside the median. The parkway widens to six lanes through here, then reaches the next exits for northbound I-91 with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrance to and from the westbound direction of the [[Interstate 691|I-691]] freeway, where there is also access from westbound I-691 to the northbound Wilbur Cross Parkway. Past I-691, Route 15 narrows back to four lanes, and turns north-northwest before heading north-northeast again, where the Wilbur Cross Parkway ends and northbound US 5 merges with northbound Route 15 to head toward the suburban areas of [[Greater Hartford]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Berlin Turnpike===\n[[File:Berlin Turnpike.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin Turnpike]]\nRoute 15 continues onto a four-lane divided surface highway concurrent with US 5, known as the [[Berlin Turnpike]], running between Silver Lake to the west and [[Lamentation Mountain]] to the east. Here it passes along a commercial strip, before passing areas of residence. The highway enters the city of [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]] and [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], and briefly forms the western edge of [[Lamentation Mountain State Park]], before heading back into commercial areas. An old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike, splits to the west, while US 5/Route 15 reverse curve to their interchange with the [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] freeway and [[Connecticut Route 372|Route 372]] in which all access besides the ramps from US 5/Route 15 to southbound Route 9 and from Southbound Route 9 to US 5/Route 15 is made via Route 372. North of Route 9, the old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike rejoins the new road briefly, before splitting again, this time to the east. The highway crosses the [[Mattabesset River]] before intersecting the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 160|Route 160]]. US 5/Route 15 passes rows of shopping centers, as it comes into the town of [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], insecting the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 173|Route 173]], which heads north towards the town of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. The highway continues to its junction with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 176|Route 176]], which heads north towards the center of Newington. A park and ride lot is located in the northeastern corner of this intersection, with Griswoldville Avenue. From here, US 5/Route 15 passes the ConnDOT headquarters on the east, prior to reaching the intersections with [[Connecticut Route 287|Route 287]]. The highway leaves Newington at its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 175|Route 175]], which heads west towards the center of town and east towards the town of [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\nAfter the Route 175 interchange, US 5/Route 15 enters Wethersfield and passes more commercial areas before reaching the partial interchange with [[Connecticut Route 314|Route 314]]. The Berlin Turnpike splits and continues north-northeast along Route 314, narrowing to a two-lane undivided road, until it reaches the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] city line, continuing into that city as Maple Avenue. US 5/Route 15 exits onto a four-lane freeway that heads northeast towards I-91 as a limited-access outlet into Hartford.<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n===Wilbur Cross Highway===\n\nPast Route 314, US 5/Route 15 continue onto the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]], a four-lane freeway with a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle. The highway passes through wooded urbanized areas, to the southeast of the Connecticut Department of Labor headquarters, before it comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 99|Route 99]], in which the overpass that carries the two routes over that route and the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]]'s [[Connecticut Valley Railroad]] line is called the [[Clinton \"Jiggs\" Hughes Memorial Bridge]]. Next, US 5/Route 15 comes into Hartford, turns north-northeast at an interchange with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], where there are ramps from northbound and southbound US 5/Route 15 to southbound I-91, and from northbound I-91 to northbound I-91 to southbound US 5/Route 15. The next interchange at Brainard Road/Airport Road with access to [[Hartford-Brainard Airport]], has no southbound exit. The highway continues through industrial areas and comes exits from the southbound Wilbur Cross Highway to Southbound I-91, as well as an exit from the northbound Wilbur Cross Highway and northbound I-91 that also provides access to westbound [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania-Massachusetts)|I-84]].<ref name=\"google\" /> \n\n[[File:CT15sRoad-Exit90-US5n-Exit86-Int91-ButtonCopy (32247253503).jpg|thumb|left|Route&nbsp;15 southbound in Hartford]]\nFrom here, US 5/Route 15 cross over the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Charter Oak Bridge]], where the routes enter the town of [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]]. On the other side of the bridge, there is an interchange serving [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]], where northbound US 5 splits and exits Route 15 onto Main Street, which runs north through the center of East Hartford. Route 15 reverse curves to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Silver Lane, before the highway reaches its northern terminus and merges onto eastbound I-84 and [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]]. A dedicated connection also exists between Route 15 and I-84/US 6's high-occupany vehicle lanes. The Wilbur Cross Highway continues northeast along I-84 towards [[Interstate 90]]/[[Massachusetts Turnpike]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"google\" /><ref name=ctlog>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf |title=Connecticut State Highway Log (2006) |access-date=May 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927215816/http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=restrictions>Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles: [http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=810&q=310268&dmvNavDLTEST=|27862  Registering a Pick-up Truck with Passenger Plates]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Route&nbsp;15 designation was created as part of the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]] and originally ran from [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] through [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] and [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line in [[Union, Connecticut|Union]].<ref name=\"1932renum\" /> The original route used the pre-expressway alignment of modern [[Route 17 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;17]] to [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]], Main Street to East Hartford center, [[U.S. Route 5 (Connecticut)|U.S.&nbsp;Route 5]] to the junction with [[Route 30 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;30]], then modern Route&nbsp;30 to [[Stafford, Connecticut|Stafford]], then modern [[Route 190 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;190]] to Union, and modern [[Route 171 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;171]] to the Massachusetts state line.<ref name=kurumi>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct15.html kurumi.com - Route 15]</ref>\n\nIn 1943, a newly constructed two-lane highway (now the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]]) between [[Tolland, Connecticut|Tolland]] and Union was opened to traffic. Route&nbsp;15 was relocated on this new highway and the former Route&nbsp;15 between [[Route 74 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;74]] and [[Route 190 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;190]] (then part of [[Route 20 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;20]]) was redesignated as Route&nbsp;30. By 1948, the rest of the old two-lane Wilbur Cross Highway to East Hartford had also opened, connecting to the [[Charter Oak Bridge]] and the [[Hartford Bypass]]. In 1948, the State Highway Department decided to relocate Route&nbsp;15 to a series of roadways, namely the [[Merritt Parkway]], [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], [[Berlin Turnpike]], Hartford Bypass, Charter Oak Bridge, and the new Wilbur Cross Highway, creating a modern, high-speed throughway from the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line to the Massachusetts state line. The Route&nbsp;15 designation was applied to the previously unnumbered parkways from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], then overlaid with U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;5 through East Hartford, then designated on the southern half of the Wilbur Cross Highway to Tolland, connecting with the portion previously designated as Route&nbsp;15 five years before. The former Route&nbsp;15 between South Windsor and Tolland was reassigned as an extension of Route&nbsp;30, and the former Route&nbsp;15 between New Haven and Glastonbury became redesignated as Route&nbsp;17.<ref name=kurumi/><ref name=larned/>\n\nIn 1948, a portion of the Wilbur Cross Parkway between [[Route 34 (Connecticut)|Route&nbsp;34]] and Whitney Avenue had still been under construction. Route&nbsp;15 was temporarily routed along Route&nbsp;34, Sherman Avenue (former Routes 5 and 10), Henry Street/Munson Street/Hillside Place/Edwards Street (former Route&nbsp;5), and Whitney Avenue (former Route&nbsp;10A). By 1949, the Wilbur Cross Parkway was completed and the temporary Route&nbsp;15 designation was removed from the surface streets. Further improvements in the Wilbur Cross Highway took place over the next several years and the road became a four-lane divided highway by 1954. In 1968, most of the Wilbur Cross Highway was designated as [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-86]] and further upgrades to the road were implemented. Route&nbsp;15 and I-86 overlapped from the current 15/84 junction in East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line. In 1984, the overlap was removed, truncating Route&nbsp;15 to its current northern end, while at the same time I-86 was redesignated as I-84.<ref name=larned>Larry Larned, \"Route 15: The Road to Hartford\", (Arcadia Publishing, 2002)</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=routelog>{{cite web |url=https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DOT/documents/dpolicy/traflog/TrafficLog12pdf.pdf |title=2012 Traffic Volumes, State Maintained Highway Network |author=State of Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref>}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=25\n|location=Greenwich\n|lspan=5\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|Parkway|Hutchinson River|dir1=south|to2=to|location1=[[New York City]]}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]; exit numbers continue south along Hutchinson Parkway\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=27\n|mile=0.05\n|road={{Jct|state=NY|NY|120A|dir1=north|name1=King Street|location1=[[Armonk, NY]]}}\n|notes=Access to NY 120A south via Hutchinson Parkway exit 30S\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=28\n|mile=3.39\n|road=Round Hill Road\n|notes=To Greenwich Business District\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=29\n|mile=4.16\n|road=Lake Avenue\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=31\n|mile=5.71\n|road=North Street\n|notes=To Greenwich Business District\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=3\n|exit=33\n|mile=8.89\n|road=Den Road\n|notes=[[Right-in/right-out]] interchange\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=34\n|mile=9.22\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|104|name1=Long Ridge Road}}\n|notes=To Downtown Stamford and [[University of Connecticut]] Stamford Campus\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=35\n|mile=10.40\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|137|name1=High Ridge Road}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=New Canaan\n|lspan=2\n|exit=36\n|mile=13.15\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|106|name1=Old Stamford Road}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=37\n|mile=13.89\n|mile2=14.10\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|124|city1=New Canaan|city2=Darien}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Norwalk\n|lspan=3\n|exit=38\n|mile=16.01\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|123|name1=New Canaan Avenue}}\n|notes=To [[Norwalk Community College]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=39\n|mile=16.87\n|mile2=17.31\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|7|city1=Norwalk|city2=Danbury}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance; signed as exits 39A (south) and 39B (north); redesign in proposal stage<ref name=7-15Norwalk>{{cite news|title=Route 7/15 Norwalk Project|url=http://7-15norwalk.com/|accessdate=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328030115/http://7-15norwalk.com/|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=40\n|mile=17.53\n|mile2=17.63\n|road={{jct|state=CT|road|Main Avenue|US|7|to2=yes|city1=Norwalk|city2=Danbury}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 40A (south) and 40B (north); no northbound signage for US 7\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Westport\n|lspan=2\n|exit=41\n|mile=20.73\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|33|city1=Westport|city2=Wilton}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=42\n|mile=21.59\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|57|city1=Westport|city2=Weston}}\n}} \n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Fairfield\n|lspan=2\n|exit=44\n|mile=26.95\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|58|city1=Fairfield|city2=Redding}}\n|notes=To Fairfield Business District and [[Fairfield University]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=46\n|mile=28.58\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|59|city1=Fairfield|city2=Easton}}\n|notes=To [[General Electric]] Headquarters\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Trumbull\n|lspan=7\n|exit=47\n|mile=29.31\n|road=Park Avenue \n|notes=To [[University of Bridgeport]] and [[Sacred Heart University]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=48\n|mile=30.37\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|111|name1=Main Street|location1=[[Long Hill, Trumbull, Connecticut|Long Hill]]|city2=Monroe}}\n|notes=[[Single-point urban interchange]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=49S\n|mile=31.64\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=CT|CT|25|dir1=south|CT|8|dir2=south|to2=yes|city1=Bridgeport}}\n|notes=No southbound exit; exit 7A on (Route 25) northbound\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=32.69\n|exit=49N\n|road={{jct|state=CT|CT|25|dir1=north|city1=Danbury}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 49 southbound; exit 8A and B on (Route 25) southbound\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=50\n|mile=32.99\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|127|city1=Trumbull}}\n|notes=Southbound exit and northbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=51\n|mile=33.51\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|108|name1=Nichols Avenue|city1=Trumbull|city2=Stratford}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|exit=52\n|mile=33.77\n|mile2=34.57\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|8|CT|108|city1=Bridgeport|city2=Waterbury|to2=yes}}\n|notes=No northbound exit to Route 8 southbound; signed as exit 9 northbound and 10 southbound on Route 8\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stratford\n|exit=53\n|mile=36.54\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|110|city1=Stratford|city2=Shelton}}\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|river=[[Housatonic River]]\n|mile=37.53\n|bridge=[[Igor I.
