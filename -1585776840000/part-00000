Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].\n\n[[File:MET DT5084.jpg|thumb|left|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38344 Mandala of Chandra, God of the Moon], Nepal (Kathmandu Valley) via The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nA common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]].

Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]\n\n'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.\n\nThe major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\nEach divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.\n[[File:Medicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|thumb|upright|left| Painted [[Bhutan]]ese [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[mandala]] with [[Perfection of Wisdom|the goddess Prajnaparamita]] in center, 19th century, [[Rubin Museum of Art]].]]\nBhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.\n\nThe arts and crafts of [[Bhutan]] that represents the exclusive \u201cspirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\u2019 is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the \u201cthirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan\u201d; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the \u2018[[Folk Heritage Museum]]\u2019 in Thimphu. There is also a \u2018Voluntary Artists Studio\u2019 in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu.

The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.\n\nBy the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences \u2013 pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures \u2013 and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000149285|title=Rehabilitation and preservation of Cambodian performing arts|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourismcambodia.com/culture/art-and-culture.htm|title=Khmer Art and Culture - Khmer Culture {{!}} Tourism Cambodia|website=www.tourismcambodia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Fronton Cambodge Mus\u00e9e Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]\n\nThe gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the \u201cdeva-raja\u201d required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign's divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself \u2013 if, it's true, in idealized form \u2013 immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phungtian|first=Charuwan|date=|title=Thai - Cambodian Culture Relationship through Arts|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/thai_cambodian_art.pdf|journal=Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=Magadh University}}</ref>\n\nThe sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power.

Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.[[File:\u6e05 \u6c6a\u606d \u6479\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b\u8096\u50cf \u8ef8-Copy of a Portrait of Zhao Mengfu MET DP216665.jpg|thumb|Copy of a portrait of [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|253x253px]]\n\nIn the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (\u8a5e) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].\n\n=== Chinese painting and calligraphy art ===\n'''Chinese painting'''\n\nGongbi and Xieyi are two painting styles in Chinese painting. \n\nGongbi means \"meticulous\", the rich colours and details in the picture are its main features, its content mainly depicts portraits or narratives.

It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.\n\nThe visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], \"Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.\"\n\nInsight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.\n\nSpecific periods: \t\n\n*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] \u2013 present)\n \t\n*Islamic ascendancy (712\u20131757 [[Common Era|CE]])\n\n*The colonial period (1757\u20131947)\n\n*Modern and Postmodern art in India \n\n*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)\n\n==Indonesian art==\n{{Main article|Indonesian art}}\n{{See|Indonesian culture|List of Indonesian painters}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Prins Panji in een hof met drie vrouwen.

[[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities.

Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.\n\n===Balinese art===\n{{Main article|Balinese art}}\n[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]\n'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Eiseman\n| first=Fred and Margaret\n| title=Woodcarving of Bali\n| publisher=Periplus\n| year=1988\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| date=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings.

The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.\n\n==Japanese art==\n{{Main article|Japanese art|Japanese painting|Ukiyo-e|Japanese sculpture|Ryukyuan lacquerware|Japanese calligraphy|Nihonga|List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)}}\n[[File:Birds and flowers of the four seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=3|left|Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground.]]\n\n'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.\n\nThe art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''\n[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]\n{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|\u7d75\u753b|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.\n\nThe origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[J\u014dmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&nbsp;BC \u2013 300&nbsp;AD) ''[[d\u014dtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300\u2013700&nbsp;AD).\n\nAncient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal\u2014especially [[bronze]]\u2014and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture \u2013 except for miniaturized works \u2013 had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.\n\n''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning \"floating world\", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term \"Sorrowful World\" (\u6182\u304d\u4e16), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.\n\n==Korean art==\n[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (\uae08\uac15\uc804\ub3c4, \u91d1\u525b\u5168\u5716), Korea, c.1734]]\n\n{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}\n'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.\n\nWhile there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.\n\nThe study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]\u2019s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea's own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''\n\nGenerally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.\n\nThroughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.\n\nThis distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].\n\n'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japan's annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated \"While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this.\"  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}</ref> \n\n'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Laotian art==\n{{Main article|Lao art}}\n[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]\n[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]\n'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].\n\nLao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].\n\nMany beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.\n\n==Nepalese art==\n{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}\nThe ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n==Thai art==\n{{Main article|Thai art}}\n[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]\n'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.\n\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.\n\nThe Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the \"walking Buddha\" pose.\n\nSukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[P\u0101li|Pali]] texts:\n*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; \n*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;\n*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];\n*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;\n*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;\n*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;\n*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;\n*[[human head|head]] like an egg;\n*Hair like scorpion stingers;\n*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;\n*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;\n*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;\n*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;\n*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.\n\nSukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.\n\n==Tibetan art==\n[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]\n{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}\n\n'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].\n\nAs [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.\n\nTibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]\nA visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.\n\nHistorians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.<ref name=McKay>McKay, Alex.

The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.\n\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802\u20131945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam.

However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\n==Filipino art==\n{{see also|Culture of Philippines|Art of the Philippines}}\n\n[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[Jos\u00e9 Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.\n[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]\nKutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process.

''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques\u2014sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art. \n\n==Central Asian Art==\n{{Main article|Central Asian art}}The [[Central Asian art|Central Asian Art]] has gained much fame.

Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].\n\n[[File:MET DT5084.jpg|thumb|left|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38344 Mandala of Chandra, God of the Moon], Nepal (Kathmandu Valley) via The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nA common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]].

Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]\n\n'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.\n\nThe major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\nEach divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.\n[[File:Medicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|thumb|upright|left| Painted [[Bhutan]]ese [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[mandala]] with [[Perfection of Wisdom|the goddess Prajnaparamita]] in center, 19th century, [[Rubin Museum of Art]].]]\nBhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.\n\nThe arts and crafts of [[Bhutan]] that represents the exclusive \u201cspirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\u2019 is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the \u201cthirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan\u201d; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the \u2018[[Folk Heritage Museum]]\u2019 in Thimphu. There is also a \u2018Voluntary Artists Studio\u2019 in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu.

The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.\n\nBy the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences \u2013 pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures \u2013 and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000149285|title=Rehabilitation and preservation of Cambodian performing arts|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourismcambodia.com/culture/art-and-culture.htm|title=Khmer Art and Culture - Khmer Culture {{!}} Tourism Cambodia|website=www.tourismcambodia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Fronton Cambodge Mus\u00e9e Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]\n\nThe gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the \u201cdeva-raja\u201d required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign\u2019s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself \u2013 if, it\u2019s true, in idealized form \u2013 immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phungtian|first=Charuwan|date=|title=Thai - Cambodian Culture Relationship through Arts|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/thai_cambodian_art.pdf|journal=Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=Magadh University}}</ref>\n\nThe sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power.

Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders.

Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].\n\n=== Chinese painting and calligraphy art ===\n'''Chinese painting'''\n\nGongbi and Xieyi are two painting styles in Chinese painting. \n\nGongbi means \"meticulous\", the rich colours and details in the picture are its main features, its content mainly depicts portraits or narratives.

After that, the Kaishu style (traditional regular script) has appeared, and its structure is simpler and neater, this script is still widely used today.<ref>Yee, C. (2019).

The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. \n\nThe art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].\n\nThe contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. \n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].\n\nOne of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.\n\nThe visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], \"Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.\"\n\nInsight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.\n\nSpecific periods: \t\n\n*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] \u2013 present)\n \t\n*Islamic ascendancy (712\u20131757 [[Common Era|CE]])\n\n*The colonial period (1757\u20131947)\n\n*Modern and Postmodern art in India \n\n*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)\n\n==Indonesian art==\n{{Main article|Indonesian art}}\n{{See|Indonesian culture|List of Indonesian painters}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Prins Panji in een hof met drie vrouwen.

[[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.\nIndonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.\n\n[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]\nOther exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.\n\nIndonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.\n\n[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760\u2013830&nbsp;AD]]\nMost notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.\n\nCalligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.\n\n===Balinese art===\n{{Main article|Balinese art}}\n[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]\n'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Eiseman\n| first=Fred and Margaret\n| title=Woodcarving of Bali\n| publisher=Periplus\n| year=1988\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| date=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings.

The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.\n\n==Japanese art==\n{{Main article|Japanese art|Japanese painting|Ukiyo-e|Japanese sculpture|Ryukyuan lacquerware|Japanese calligraphy|Nihonga|List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)}}\n[[File:Birds and flowers of the four seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=3|left|Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground.]]\n\n'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.\n\nThe art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''\n[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]\n{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|\u7d75\u753b|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.\n\nThe origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[J\u014dmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&nbsp;BC \u2013 300&nbsp;AD) ''[[d\u014dtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300\u2013700&nbsp;AD).\n\nAncient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal\u2014especially [[bronze]]\u2014and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture \u2013 except for miniaturized works \u2013 had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.\n\n''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning \"floating world\", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term \"Sorrowful World\" (\u6182\u304d\u4e16), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.\n\n==Korean art==\n[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt.

Because of [[Korea]]\u2019s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea\u2019s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''\n\nGenerally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.\n\nThroughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.\n\nThis distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].\n\n'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated \"While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this.\"  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}</ref> \n\n'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Laotian art==\n{{Main article|Lao art}}\n[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]\n[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]\n'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].\n\nLao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].\n\nMany beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.\n\n==Nepalese art==\n{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}\nThe ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people.

Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.\n\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.\n\nThe Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the \"walking Buddha\" pose.\n\nSukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[P\u0101li|Pali]] texts:\n*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; \n*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;\n*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];\n*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;\n*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;\n*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;\n*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;\n*[[human head|head]] like an egg;\n*Hair like scorpion stingers;\n*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;\n*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;\n*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;\n*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;\n*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.\n\nSukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.\n\n==Tibetan art==\n[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]\n{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}\n\n'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].\n\nAs [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.\n\nTibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]\nA visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.\n\nHistorians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.<ref name=McKay>McKay, Alex.

The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.\n\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802\u20131945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts de l\u2019Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History \u2013 A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTravel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.<ref name=\"vcw\">{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327130249/http://particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx |date=March 27, 2010 }}</ref> A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.<ref name=\"vcw\"/> Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.<ref name=\"vcw\"/>\n\nModern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.\n\n===Vietnamese calligraphy===\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\n==Filipino art==\n{{see also|Culture of Philippines|Art of the Philippines}}\n\n[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[Jos\u00e9 Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.\n[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]\nKutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques\u2014sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art. \n\n==Central Asian Art==\n{{Main article|Central Asian art}}The [[Central Asian art|Central Asian Art]] has gained much fame.

Both aircraft were operating under [[visual flight rules|visual flight rules (VFR)]] at an altitude of 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,520 m) at ~1128 hrs. in conditions reported as hazy and overcast; the AT-502B pilot had not established radio contact with air traffic control, and his aircraft was not equipped with a [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]], but neither was required for VFR operation in [[airspace class (United States)#Class E|Class [Category] E airspace]]. The crash is primarily attributed to the failure of the pilots to \"see and avoid\" conflicting air traffic during VFR flight. Investigators conclude that the aircraft collided at an angle of approximately 100 degrees, and a USAF Aerospace Physiologist determines that the AT-502B's left roll cage/door structure created a blind spot that occluded the T-37B from the AT-502B's pilot's line of sight, but the T-37B's right canopy bow did not produce a blind spot for the T-37B pilots. Contributing factors included the lack of a transponder and radios on the AT-502B and the reduced visibility due to haze. Additionally, the USAF report notes that the AT-502B was flying at an inappropriate altitude for its compass heading, as visual flight rules called for cruise flight at an odd or even altitude plus 500&nbsp;ft (152 m); however, given the pilot's high level of VFR experience, USAF investigators surmise that he was transitioning to a proper altitude at the time, but this hypothesis cannot be confirmed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20050126X00109&ntsbno=CHI05FA055B&akey=2|title=NTSB Report CHI05FA055B|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20050126X00109|title=NTSB Probable Cause Report CHI05FA055A|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usaf.aib.law.af.mil/ExecSum2005/T-37B_14Jan05.pdf|title=Executive Summary- Aircraft Accident Investigation- T-37B S/N 66-8003 & AT-502B, N8526M|publisher=United States Air Force|accessdate=21 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216174603/http://usaf.aib.law.af.mil/ExecSum2005/T-37B_14Jan05.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2013}}</ref> This accident is a rare example of a [[midair collision]] in daylight VFR conditions during cruise flight distant from an airport.\n\n;26 January:A [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion]] helicopter ferrying troops crashes during a sandstorm near [[Ar Rutba]], [[Iraq]] killing all 31 on board.\n\n;29 January:A [[Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet]] crashes into ocean while landing on [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'' (CV 63)]].

Both aircraft were operating under [[visual flight rules|visual flight rules (VFR)]] at an altitude of 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,520 m) at ~1128 hrs. in conditions reported as hazy and overcast; the AT-502B pilot had not established radio contact with air traffic control, and his aircraft was not equipped with a [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]], but neither was required for VFR operation in [[airspace class (United States)#Class E|Class [Category] E airspace]]. The crash is primarily attributed to the failure of the pilots to \"see and avoid\" conflicting air traffic during VFR flight. Investigators conclude that the aircraft collided at an angle of approximately 100 degrees, and a USAF Aerospace Physiologist determines that the AT-502B's left roll cage/door structure created a blind spot that occluded the T-37B from the AT-502B's pilot's line of sight, but the T-37B's right canopy bow did not produce a blind spot for the T-37B pilots. Contributing factors included the lack of a transponder and radios on the AT-502B and the reduced visibility due to haze. Additionally, the USAF report notes that the AT-502B was flying at an inappropriate altitude for its compass heading, as visual flight rules called for cruise flight at an odd or even altitude plus 500&nbsp;ft (152 m); however, given the pilot's high level of VFR experience, USAF investigators surmise that he was transitioning to a proper altitude at the time, but this hypothesis cannot be confirmed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20050126X00109&ntsbno=CHI05FA055B&akey=2|title=NTSB Report CHI05FA055B|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20050126X00109|title=NTSB Probable Cause Report CHI05FA055A|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usaf.aib.law.af.mil/ExecSum2005/T-37B_14Jan05.pdf|title=Executive Summary- Aircraft Accident Investigation- T-37B S/N 66-8003 & AT-502B, N8526M|publisher=United States Air Force|accessdate=21 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216174603/http://usaf.aib.law.af.mil/ExecSum2005/T-37B_14Jan05.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2013}}</ref> This accident is a rare example of a [[midair collision]] in daylight VFR conditions during cruise flight distant from an airport.\n\n;26 January:A [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion]] helicopter ferrying troops crashes during a sandstorm near [[Ar Rutba]], [[Iraq]] killing all 31 on board.\n\n;29 January:A [[Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet]] crashes into ocean while landing on [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'' (CV 63)]].
