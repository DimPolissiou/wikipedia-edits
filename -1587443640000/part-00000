Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S.

Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !!

Suffix !! English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !!

Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S. Indrakumar |date=November 2013 |title=Agreements in Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/nov2013/indrakumaragreementsmanipurifinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Noun (Meitei) !! Noun (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)\n|-\n| ama || one || mi ama laak\u2019i || A person comes.\n|-\n| khara || some || mi khara laak\u2019i || Some persons come.\n|-\n| mayaam || many || mi mayaam laak\u2019i || Many persons come.\n|}\n\n=== Compound verbs ===\nCompound verbs are created by combining root verbs each ending with aspect markers. While the variety of suffixes is high, all compound verbs utilise one of two:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Devi |first1=M.

Suffix !! English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !! Aspect marker !! Combined form\n|-\n| Meitei || tum || -thok || -le || tumthokle\n|-\n| English || sleep || out/ come out || perfect aspect || has started sleeping\n|-\n| Meitei || tum || -ning || -le || tumningle\n|-\n| English || sleep || want || perfect aspect || has felt sleepy\n|}\n\nCompound verbs can also be formed utilising both compound suffixes as well, allowing utterances such as ''pithokningle'' meaning \"want to give out\".\n\n==Number words==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Young children who do not know about the tales that have been passed on from generation to generation are very rare. Regarding the history behind the ancient use of [[proverb]]s that defines the way conversation is held with the Meitei language, it is a way of expressing and telling stories and even using modern slang with old proverbs to communicate between one another.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Betholia |first1=C. |date=August 2008 |title=Manipuri Culture Seen Through Proverbs |url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/view/111/883 |journal=Indian Folklife |issue=30 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref> \n\nThe Meitei language is known to be one of the oldest languages in [[Northeast India|northeastern India]] and has a lengthy 2000-year period of existence.
