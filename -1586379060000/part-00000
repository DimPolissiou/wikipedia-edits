Mayor [[William Frederick Havemeyer|William Havemeyer]] shepherded the NYPD together, originating the phrase \"New York (City)'s Finest\".<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', May 13, 2017, p. C6</ref> In 1857, it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force, which abolished the Municipal Police. Twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption.\n\n==Rank structure==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nOfficers begin service with the rank of \"probationary police officer\", also referred to as \"recruit officer\". After successful completion of five and a half to six months (or sometimes more) of Police Academy training in various academic, physical, and tactical fields, officers graduate from the Police Academy. While graduates are referred to as \"police officers\", they officially continue to be \"probationary police officers\", or informally \"rookies\", until they have completed an additional 18 month probationary period.\n\nThere are three career \"tracks\" in the NYPD: supervisory, investigative, and specialist. The supervisory track consists of nine sworn titles, referred to as ranks. Promotion to the ranks of [[sergeant]], [[lieutenant]], and [[police captain|captain]] are made via competitive [[civil service]] examinations. After reaching the civil service rank of captain, promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector, inspector, deputy chief, assistant chief, (bureau) chief and chief of department is made at the discretion of the police commissioner. Promotion from the rank of police officer to [[detective]] is discretionary by the police commissioner or required by law when the officer has performed eighteen months or more of investigative duty.\n\nThe entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist. The commissioner may grant discretionary grades of second and finally first. These grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors. Specifically, a second grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a sergeant's and a first grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenant's. Detectives are police officers who usually perform investigatory duties but have no official supervisory authority. A \"detective first grade\" still falls under the command of a sergeant or above. Just like detectives, sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks.{{-}}\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Badge design\n!Badge color\n!Badge number\n!Uniform\n|-\n|[[Chief of police|Chief of Department]]\n|[[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Medallion with eagle and star(s)\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold, with silver star(s)\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|No\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|White shirt,<br />black [[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Bureau Chief<br/>Bureau Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020\nSupervising Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n|Assistant Chief<br/>Assistant Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Assistant Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n|Deputy Chief<br/>Deputy Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>District Surgeon\n|[[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n|[[Inspector#Municipal police|Inspector]]<br/>Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Police Surgeon\n|[[File:Colonel Gold-vector.svg|center|50px]]\n|Medallion with eagle<br/>(Chaplains have faith insignia overlaid)\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold\n|-\n|Deputy Inspector\n|[[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|center|30px]]\n|Laurels and crown with oak leaves\n|-\n|[[Police captain|Captain]]\n|[[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|Laurels and crown\n|-\n|[[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n|[[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|[[File:NYPD Lieutenant Badge.jpeg|130px]]\n|-\n|[[Sergeant#Police departments and prisons|Sergeant]]\n|[[File:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]] (sleeve)\n|[[File:NYPD_Sergeant_Badge.jpg|135px]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Detective (grades 3rd\u20131st)\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|[[File:Badge of a New York City Police Department detective.png|100px]]\n|-\n|[[Police Officer]]\n|rowspan=3|[[File:NYPD badge.png|100px]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Silver\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes,<br />matching hat badge\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />silver hat badge with matching number\n|-\n|Probationary Police Officer\n|-\n|Recruit Officer\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Slate grey,<br />black [[garrison cap]]\n|-\n|[[Cadet]]\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|}\n\n{{cnote|\u2020|Uniform rank that has no police powers}}\n\n[[File:New York Police Department officers.jpg|thumb|Officers from the Emergency Service Unit]]\n[[File:NYPD police boat, Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Brooklyn at sunset.JPG|thumb|Police boat patrolling the [[East River]]]]\n\nThere are two basic types of [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|detective in the NYPD]]: \"detective-investigators\" and \"detective-specialists\". Detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term \"detective\" and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies. Most police officers gain their detective title by working in the Narcotics Division of the Detective Bureau. Detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating [[murder]]s, [[rape]]s, [[robbery|robberies]], [[burglary|burglaries]] and other crimes within that precinct's boundaries.\n\nOther detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level, investigating [[terrorist group]]s, [[organized crime]], [[drug dealing|narcotics dealing]], [[extortion]], [[bias crime]]s, [[political corruption]], [[kidnapping]]s, major [[fraud]]s or [[theft]]s committed against banks or museums, [[police corruption]], contractor fraud and other complex, politically sensitive or high-profile cases. A squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the city's five [[district attorney|district attorneys']] offices.\n\nPromotion from \"police officer\" to \"detective-investigator\" is based on investigative experience. Typically, a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated \"detective-investigator\" and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation. In the recent past, however, there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title. Newly appointed detectives start at \"detective third grade\", which has a pay rate roughly between that of \"police officer\" and \"sergeant\". As they gain seniority and experience, they can be \"promoted\" to \"detective second-grade\", which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants. \"Detective first-grade\" is an elite designation for the department's most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants.\n\nAll these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted. While senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads, not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer. All detective grades still fall under the \"chain of command\" of the supervisory ranks beginning with \"sergeant\" through \"chief of department\". Detectives, like police officers, are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks.\n\n[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant debriefing officers at [[Times Square]]]]\n\nWhile carrying with them increased pay and prestige, none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority. Contrary to some media portrayals, there is no specific rank of \"detective sergeant\" or \"detective lieutenant\". Lieutenants and Sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors, and are responsible for all investigations. There is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of \"Sergeant\u2014Supervisor Detective Squad\" (SDS), or Lieutenant\u2014Commander Detective Squad (CDS) therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision. Their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank's pay grade, and similar to a detective's \"grade\", is also a discretionary promotion.\n\nThis pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units, i.e. [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|Detective Bureau]], Internal Affairs Bureau, Counter-Terrorism Bureau, and the [[New York City Police Department Intelligence Bureau|Intelligence Bureau]]. Lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment, pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts. \"Detective-specialists\" are a relatively new designation and one unique to the NYPD. In the 1980s, many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status, but were not being assigned to investigative duties. Examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor, police commissioner and other senior officials.\n\nTo remedy this situation, the rank of detective-specialist was created. These officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs, e.g., executive protection units, community affaires or NCO's, emergency service unit, sharpshooter, patrol instructor, helicopter instructor, etc. Like detective-investigators, detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status.\n\n[[File:NYPD police motorcycle.png|thumb|Motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby]]\n\nThe Department is administered and governed by the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner]], who is appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]]. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law.\n\nA Police Commissioner who comes up from the sworn ranks retains that status while serving as a police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm and retains the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioner's squad.\n\nThese individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department, and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, support services, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. Despite their role, as civilian administrators of the department, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the Commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations, however). Within the rank structure, there are also designations, known as \"grades\", that connote differences in duties, experience, and pay. However, supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above.\n\nBadges in the New York City Police Department are referred to as \"shields\" (the traditional term), though not all badge designs are strictly [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield-shaped]]. Every rank has a different badge design (with the exception of \"police officer\" and \"probationary police officer\"), and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge. Lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers, and tax registry number. Lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number. All sworn members of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a red background. Civilian employees of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a blue background, signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm. All ID cards have an expiration date.\n\n==Organization and structure==\n{{Main|Organization of the New York City Police Department}}\n[[File:NYPD One Police Plaza.JPG|thumb|[[1 Police Plaza]], NYPD HQ]]\n\n===Office of the Chief of Department===\nThe [[Chief of Police|Chief of Department]] serves as the senior sworn member of the NYPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/administration.shtml|title=NYPD Administration|work=nyc.gov}}</ref> [[Terence Monahan]] is the 40th individual to hold the post, which prior to 1987 was known as the chief of operations and before that as chief inspector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|title=NYPD - Administration|work=nyc.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920220513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|archivedate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Bureaus===\n{{convert to prose|date=January 2019}}\nThe Department is divided into twenty bureaus,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureaus|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/bureaus.page|website=New York Police Department|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> which are typically commanded by a uniformed bureau chief (such as the chief of patrol and the chief of housing) or a civilian deputy commissioner (such as the Deputy Commissioner of Information Technology).

Mayor [[William Frederick Havemeyer|William Havemeyer]] shepherded the NYPD together, originating the phrase \"New York (City)'s Finest\".<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', May 13, 2017, p. C6</ref> In 1857, it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force, which abolished the Municipal Police. Twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption.\n\n==Rank structure==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nOfficers begin service with the rank of \"probationary police officer\", also referred to as \"recruit officer\". After successful completion of five and a half to six months (or sometimes more) of Police Academy training in various academic, physical, and tactical fields, officers graduate from the Police Academy. While graduates are referred to as \"police officers\", they officially continue to be \"probationary police officers\", or informally \"rookies\", until they have completed an additional 18 month probationary period.\n\nThere are three career \"tracks\" in the NYPD: supervisory, investigative, and specialist. The supervisory track consists of nine sworn titles, referred to as ranks. Promotion to the ranks of [[sergeant]], [[lieutenant]], and [[police captain|captain]] are made via competitive [[civil service]] examinations. After reaching the civil service rank of captain, promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector, inspector, deputy chief, assistant chief, (bureau) chief and chief of department is made at the discretion of the police commissioner. Promotion from the rank of police officer to [[detective]] is discretionary by the police commissioner or required by law when the officer has performed eighteen months or more of investigative duty.\n\nThe entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist. The commissioner may grant discretionary grades of second and finally first. These grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors. Specifically, a second grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a sergeant's and a first grade detective's pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenant's. Detectives are police officers who usually perform investigatory duties but have no official supervisory authority. A \"detective first grade\" still falls under the command of a sergeant or above. Just like detectives, sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks.{{-}}\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Badge design\n!Badge color\n!Badge number\n!Uniform\n|-\n|[[Chief of police|Chief of Department]]\n|[[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Medallion with eagle and star(s)\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold, with silver star(s)\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|No\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|White shirt,<br />black [[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Bureau Chief<br/>Bureau Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020\nSupervising Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n|Assistant Chief<br/>Assistant Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Assistant Chief Surgeon\n|[[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n|Deputy Chief<br/>Deputy Chief Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>District Surgeon\n|[[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n|[[Inspector#Municipal police|Inspector]]<br/>Chaplain&nbsp;\u2020<br/>Police Surgeon\n|[[File:Colonel Gold-vector.svg|center|50px]]\n|Medallion with eagle<br/>(Chaplains have faith insignia overlaid)\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gold\n|-\n|Deputy Inspector\n|[[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|center|30px]]\n|Laurels and crown with oak leaves\n|-\n|[[Police captain|Captain]]\n|[[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|Laurels and crown\n|-\n|[[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n|[[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|[[File:NYPD Lieutenant Badge.jpeg|130px]]\n|-\n|[[Sergeant#Police departments and prisons|Sergeant]]\n|[[File:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]] (sleeve)\n|[[File:NYPD_Sergeant_Badge.jpg|135px]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />gold hat badge\n|-\n|Detective (grades 3rd\u20131st)\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|[[File:Badge of a New York City Police Department detective.png|100px]]\n|-\n|[[Police Officer]]\n|rowspan=3|[[File:NYPD badge.png|100px]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Silver\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes,<br />matching hat badge\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Navy blue shirt,<br />[[peaked cap]],<br />silver hat badge with matching number\n|-\n|Probationary Police Officer\n|-\n|Recruit Officer\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Yes\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Slate grey,<br />black [[garrison cap]]\n|-\n|[[Cadet]]\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|}\n\n{{cnote|\u2020|Uniform rank that has no police powers}}\n\n[[File:New York Police Department officers.jpg|thumb|Officers from the Emergency Service Unit]]\n[[File:NYPD police boat, Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Brooklyn at sunset.JPG|thumb|Police boat patrolling the [[East River]]]]\n\nThere are two basic types of [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|detective in the NYPD]]: \"detective-investigators\" and \"detective-specialists\". Detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term \"detective\" and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies. Most police officers gain their detective title by working in the Narcotics Division of the Detective Bureau. Detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating [[murder]]s, [[rape]]s, [[robbery|robberies]], [[burglary|burglaries]] and other crimes within that precinct's boundaries.\n\nOther detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level, investigating [[terrorist group]]s, [[organized crime]], [[drug dealing|narcotics dealing]], [[extortion]], [[bias crime]]s, [[political corruption]], [[kidnapping]]s, major [[fraud]]s or [[theft]]s committed against banks or museums, [[police corruption]], contractor fraud and other complex, politically sensitive or high-profile cases. A squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the city's five [[district attorney|district attorneys']] offices.\n\nPromotion from \"police officer\" to \"detective-investigator\" is based on investigative experience. Typically, a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated \"detective-investigator\" and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation. In the recent past, however, there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title. Newly appointed detectives start at \"detective third grade\", which has a pay rate roughly between that of \"police officer\" and \"sergeant\". As they gain seniority and experience, they can be \"promoted\" to \"detective second-grade\", which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants. \"Detective first-grade\" is an elite designation for the department's most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants.\n\nAll these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted. While senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads, not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer. All detective grades still fall under the \"chain of command\" of the supervisory ranks beginning with \"sergeant\" through \"chief of department\". Detectives, like police officers, are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks.\n\n[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant debriefing officers at [[Times Square]]]]\n\nWhile carrying with them increased pay and prestige, none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority. Contrary to some media portrayals, there is no specific rank of \"detective sergeant\" or \"detective lieutenant\". Lieutenants and Sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors, and are responsible for all investigations. There is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of \"Sergeant\u2014Supervisor Detective Squad\" (SDS), or Lieutenant\u2014Commander Detective Squad (CDS) therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision. Their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank's pay grade, and similar to a detective's \"grade\", is also a discretionary promotion.\n\nThis pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units, i.e. [[New York City Police Department Detective Bureau|Detective Bureau]], Internal Affairs Bureau, Counter-Terrorism Bureau, and the [[New York City Police Department Intelligence Bureau|Intelligence Bureau]]. Lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment, pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts. \"Detective-specialists\" are a relatively new designation and one unique to the NYPD. In the 1980s, many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status, but were not being assigned to investigative duties. Examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor, police commissioner and other senior officials.\n\nTo remedy this situation, the rank of detective-specialist was created. These officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs, e.g., executive protection units, community affaires or NCO's, emergency service unit, sharpshooter, patrol instructor, helicopter instructor, etc. Like detective-investigators, detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status.\n\n[[File:NYPD police motorcycle.png|thumb|Motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby]]\n\nThe Department is administered and governed by the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner]], who is appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]]. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law.\n\nA Police Commissioner who comes up from the sworn ranks retains that status while serving as a police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm and retains the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioner's squad.\n\nThese individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department, and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, support services, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. Despite their role, as civilian administrators of the department, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the Commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations, however). Within the rank structure, there are also designations, known as \"grades\", that connote differences in duties, experience, and pay. However, supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above.\n\nBadges in the New York City Police Department are referred to as \"shields\" (the traditional term), though not all badge designs are strictly [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield-shaped]]. Every rank has a different badge design (with the exception of \"police officer\" and \"probationary police officer\"), and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge. Lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers, and tax registry number. Lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number. All sworn members of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a red background. Civilian employees of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a blue background, signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm. All ID cards have an expiration date.\n\n==Organization and structure==\n{{Main|Organization of the New York City Police Department}}\n[[File:NYPD One Police Plaza.JPG|thumb|[[1 Police Plaza]], NYPD HQ]]\n\n===Office of the Chief of Department===\nThe [[Chief of Police|Chief of Department]] serves as the senior sworn member of the NYPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/administration.shtml|title=NYPD Administration|work=nyc.gov}}</ref> [[Terence Monahan]] is the 40th individual to hold the post, which prior to 1987 was known as the chief of operations and before that as chief inspector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|title=NYPD - Administration|work=nyc.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920220513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/department_co.shtml|archivedate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Bureaus===\n{{convert to prose|date=January 2019}}\nThe Department is divided into twenty bureaus,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureaus|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/bureaus.page|website=New York Police Department|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> which are typically commanded by a uniformed bureau chief (such as the chief of patrol and the chief of housing) or a civilian deputy commissioner (such as the Deputy Commissioner of Information Technology).

Though the Grand Tour was primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Northern European nations, and, from the second half of the 18th century, by some South and North Americans.\n\nBy the mid 18th century, the Grand Tour had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in [[Central Europe]] as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined as enthusiasm for neo-classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and steamship travel\u2014an era in which [[Thomas Cook]] made the \"Cook's Tour\" of early mass [[tourism]] a byword.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008 described the Grand Tour in this way:\n\n{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and [[Italy]] in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned painting]]s, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html |title=Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour |publisher=New York Times |work=Frugal Traveler |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2016 |author=Gross, Matt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929202256/http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html |archive-date=September 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nThe primary value of the Grand Tour lay in its exposure to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent. In addition, it provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music.\n\nA Grand Tour could last anywhere from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a [[Cicerone]], a knowledgeable guide or tutor. The legacy of the Grand Tour lives on to the modern day and is still evident in works of travel and literature. From its aristocratic origins and the permutations of sentimental and romantic travel to the age of tourism and globalization, the Grand Tour still influences the destinations tourists choose and shapes the ideas of culture and sophistication that surround the act of travel.<ref name=\"colletta\">{{cite book|last1=Colletta|first1=Lisa|title=The Legacy of the Grand Tour: New Essays on Travel, Literature, and Culture|date=2015|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-1611477979|pages=226|ref=colletta|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GrfkCgAAQBAJ&dq=legacy+of+the+Grand+Tour}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, the Grand Tour was neither a scholarly [[pilgrimage]] nor a religious one,<ref name=\"ce_pilgrimages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12085a.htm |title=''Pilgrimages'' |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> though a pleasurable stay in [[Venice]] and a residence in [[Rome]] were essential. Catholic Grand Tourists followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs. Since the 17th century, a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding artists to understand proper painting and sculpture techniques, though the trappings of the Grand Tour\u2014valets and coachmen, perhaps a cook, certainly a \"[[Bear-leader (guide)|bear-leader]]\" or scholarly guide\u2014were beyond their reach.\n\nThe advent of popular guides, such as the book ''An Account of Some of the Statues, Bas-Reliefs, Drawings, and Pictures in Italy'' published in 1722 by [[Jonathan Richardson]] and his son [[Jonathan Richardson the Younger]], did much to popularise such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour.\n\nIn Rome, antiquaries like [[Thomas Jenkins (antiquary)|Thomas Jenkins]] were also dealers and were able to sell and advise on the purchase of marbles; their price would rise if it were known that the Tourists were interested. [[Numismatics|Coins and medals]], which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history were also popular. [[Pompeo Batoni]] made a career of painting the English ''[[milord]]i'' posed with graceful ease among Roman antiquities. Many continued on to [[Naples]], where they also viewed [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]], but few ventured far into [[Southern Italy]], and fewer still to [[Greece]], then still under [[Ottoman Greece|Turkish rule]].\n\n==History==\nRome for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] when European clergy visited the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]].\n\nIn Britain, [[Thomas Coryat]]'s travel book ''[[Coryat's Crudities]]'' (1611), published during the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], was an early influence on the Grand Tour but it was the far more extensive tour through Italy as far as Naples undertaken by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel]], with his wife and children in 1613\u201314 that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked [[Inigo Jones]], not yet established as an architect but already known as a 'great traveller' and masque designer, to act as his [[cicerone]] (guide).<ref>E. Chaney, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rYB_HYPsa8gC&source=gbs_slider_thumb The Evolution of the Grand Tour]'', 2nd ed. (2000) and idem, Inigo Jones's \"Roman Sketchbook\", 2 vols (2006)</ref>\n\nLarger numbers of tourists began their tours after the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] in 1648. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by [[Richard Lassels]] (c. 1603\u20131668), an [[expatriate]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], in his book ''The Voyage of Italy'', which was published posthumously in Paris in 1670 and then in London.{{efn|[[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] reported that the book was \"esteemed the best and surest Guide or Tutor for young men of his Time.\" see [[Edward Chaney]], \"Richard Lassels\", [[ODNB]], and idem, ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion'' (Geneva, 1985)}} Lassels's introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished \"an accomplished, consummate Traveller\": the [[Intellectualism|intellectual]], the [[Society|social]], the [[Ethics|ethical]] (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the [[Politics|political]].\n[[File:Jean Preudhomme.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton|Douglas, 8th Duke of Hamilton]], on his Grand Tour with his physician [[John Moore (Scottish physician)|Dr. John Moore]] and the latter's son [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John]]. A view of [[Geneva]] is in the distance where they stayed for two years. Painted by [[Jean Preudhomme]] in 1774.]]\n\nThe idea of travelling for the sake of curiosity and learning was a developing idea in the 17th century. With [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), it was argued, and widely accepted, that knowledge comes entirely from the external senses, that what one knows comes from the physical stimuli to which one has been exposed. Thus, one could \"use up\" the environment, taking from it all it offers, requiring a change of place. Travel, therefore, was necessary for one to develop the mind and expand knowledge of the world.\n\nAs a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat Grand Tour, the historian [[Edward Gibbon]] remarked that \"According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman.\" Consciously adapted for intellectual self-improvement, Gibbon was \"revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan\"; most Grand Tourists did not pause more than briefly in libraries. On the eve of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era he played a significant part in introducing, [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] wrote a vivid account of his Grand Tour that made Gibbon's unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.<ref>E. Chaney, \"Gibbon, Beckford and the Interpretation of Dreams, Waking Thoughts and Incidents\", The Beckford Society Annual Lectures (London, 2004), pp. 25\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe typical 18th-century stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands reporting his findings on human nature for those unfortunates who stayed at home. Recounting one's observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation; the Grand Tour flourished in this mindset.<ref>Paul Fussell (1987), p. 129.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Tour offered a [[liberal education]], and the opportunity to acquire things otherwise unavailable, lending an air of accomplishment and prestige to the traveller. Grand Tourists would return with crates full of books, works of art, scientific instruments, and cultural artefacts \u2013 from snuff boxes and paperweights, to altars, fountains, and statuary \u2013 to be displayed in libraries, [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], gardens, [[drawing rooms]], and galleries built for that purpose. The trappings of the Grand Tour, especially portraits of the traveller painted in continental settings, became the obligatory emblems of worldliness, gravitas and influence. Artists who particularly thrived on the Grand Tour market included [[Carlo Maratti]], who was first patronised by John Evelyn as early as 1645,<ref>E. Chaney, The Evolution of English Collecting</ref> [[Pompeo Batoni]] the [[portrait]]ist, and the [[vedutisti]] such as [[Canaletto]], [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]] and [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]. The less well-off could return with an album of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] etchings.\n\nThe \"perhaps\" in Gibbon's opening remark cast an ironic shadow over his resounding statement.<ref>Noted by Redford 1996, Preface.</ref> Critics of the Grand Tour derided its lack of adventure. \"The tour of Europe is a paltry thing\", said one 18th century critic, \"a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect\".<ref name=bd>Bohls & Duncan (2005)</ref> The Grand Tour was said to reinforce the old preconceptions and prejudices about national characteristics, as [[:fr:Jean_de_Gaillard|Jean Gailhard]]'s ''Compleat Gentleman'' (1678) observes: \"French courteous. Spanish lordly. Italian amorous. German clownish.\"<ref name=bd/> The deep suspicion with which Tour was viewed at home in England, where it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him, were epitomised in the sarcastic nativist view of the ostentatiously \"well-travelled\" [[maccaroni]] of the 1760s and 1770s.\n[[File:Shepherds beside Roman ruins.jpg|thumb|Northerners found the contrast between Roman ruins and modern peasants of the [[Roman Campagna]] an educational lesson in [[Vanity|vanities]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} (painting by [[Nicolaes Pietersz Berchem]], 1661, [[Mauritshuis]])]]\n\nAlso worth noticing is that the Grand Tour not only fostered stereotypes of the countries visited but also led to a dynamic of contrast between northern and southern Europe. By constantly depicting Italy as a \"picturesque place\", the travellers also unconsciously degraded Italy as a place of backwardness.<ref>Nelson Moe, \"Italy as Europe's South\", in The View from Vesuvius, Italian Culture and the Southern Question, University of California Press, 2002</ref> This unconscious degradation is best reflected in the famous verses of Lamartine in which Italy is depicted as a \"land of the past... where everything sleeps.\"<ref>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Italy Journey</ref>\n\nAfter the advent of steam-powered transportation around 1825, the Grand Tour custom continued, but it was of a qualitative difference \u2014 cheaper to undertake, safer, easier, open to anyone. During much of the 19th century, most educated young men of privilege undertook the Grand Tour. [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] came to be included in a more broadly defined circuit. Later, it became fashionable for young women as well; a trip to Italy, with a [[spinster]] aunt as [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], was part of the upper-class women's education, as in [[E. M. Forster]]'s novel ''[[A Room with a View]]''.\n\nBritish travellers were far from alone on the roads of Europe. On the contrary, from the mid-16th century the grand tour was established as an ideal way to finish off the education of young men in countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Grand Tour : adeliges Reisen und europ\u00e4ische Kultur vom 14. bis zum 18.

There the traveller might undertake lessons in French, [[dancing]], [[fencing]], and [[Equestrianism|riding]]. The appeal of Paris lay in the sophisticated language and manners of French high society, including courtly behavior and fashion. This served to polish the young man's manners in preparation for a leadership position at home, often in government or [[diplomacy]].\n[[File:Robertspencer1641.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland]] (1640\u20131702), painted in classical dress in Rome by [[Carlo Maratti]]]]\n\nFrom Paris he would typically sojourn in urban [[Switzerland]], often in [[Geneva]] (the cradle of the [[Protestant Reformation]]) or [[Lausanne]].<ref name=ATR>{{cite web|last=Towner |first=John |title=THE GRAND TOUR A Key Phase in the History of Tourism |url=http://rosen.hospitality.ucf.edu/faculty/raywang/documents/HFT7715/History%20and%20tourism/The%20grand%20tour%20A%20key%20phase%20in%20the%20history%20of%20tourism.pdf |work=Annals of Tourism Research.

Though the Grand Tour was primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Northern European nations, and, from the second half of the 18th century, by some South and North Americans.\n\nBy the mid 18th century, the Grand Tour had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in [[Central Europe]] as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined as enthusiasm for neo-classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and steamship travel\u2014an era in which [[Thomas Cook]] made the \"Cook's Tour\" of early mass [[tourism]] a byword.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008 described the Grand Tour in this way:\n\n{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and [[Italy]] in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]].

In addition, it provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music.\n\nA Grand Tour could last anywhere from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a [[Cicerone]], a knowledgeable guide or tutor. The legacy of the Grand Tour lives on to the modern day and is still evident in works of travel and literature. From its aristocratic origins and the permutations of sentimental and romantic travel to the age of tourism and globalization, the Grand Tour still influences the destinations tourists choose and shapes the ideas of culture and sophistication that surround the act of travel.<ref name=\"colletta\">{{cite book|last1=Colletta|first1=Lisa|title=The Legacy of the Grand Tour: New Essays on Travel, Literature, and Culture|date=2015|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-1611477979|pages=226|ref=colletta|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GrfkCgAAQBAJ&dq=legacy+of+the+Grand+Tour}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, the Grand Tour was neither a scholarly [[pilgrimage]] nor a religious one,<ref name=\"ce_pilgrimages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12085a.htm |title=''Pilgrimages'' |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> though a pleasurable stay in [[Venice]] and a residence in [[Rome]] were essential. Catholic Grand Tourists followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs. Since the 17th century, a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding artists to understand proper painting and sculpture techniques, though the trappings of the Grand Tour\u2014valets and coachmen, perhaps a cook, certainly a \"[[Bear-leader (guide)|bear-leader]]\" or scholarly guide\u2014were beyond their reach.\n\nThe advent of popular guides, such as the book ''An Account of Some of the Statues, Bas-Reliefs, Drawings, and Pictures in Italy'' published in 1722 by [[Jonathan Richardson]] and his son [[Jonathan Richardson the Younger]], did much to popularise such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour.\n\nIn Rome, antiquaries like [[Thomas Jenkins (antiquary)|Thomas Jenkins]] were also dealers and were able to sell and advise on the purchase of marbles; their price would rise if it were known that the Tourists were interested. [[Numismatics|Coins and medals]], which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history were also popular. [[Pompeo Batoni]] made a career of painting the English ''[[milord]]i'' posed with graceful ease among Roman antiquities. Many continued on to [[Naples]], where they also viewed [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]], but few ventured far into [[Southern Italy]], and fewer still to [[Greece]], then still under [[Ottoman Greece|Turkish rule]].\n\n==History==\nRome for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] when European clergy visited the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]].\n\nIn Britain, [[Thomas Coryat]]'s travel book ''[[Coryat's Crudities]]'' (1611), published during the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], was an early influence on the Grand Tour but it was the far more extensive tour through Italy as far as Naples undertaken by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel]], with his wife and children in 1613\u201314 that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked [[Inigo Jones]], not yet established as an architect but already known as a 'great traveller' and masque designer, to act as his [[cicerone]] (guide).<ref>E.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by [[Richard Lassels]] (c. 1603\u20131668), an [[expatriate]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], in his book ''The Voyage of Italy'', which was published posthumously in Paris in 1670 and then in London.{{efn|[[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] reported that the book was \"esteemed the best and surest Guide or Tutor for young men of his Time.\" see [[Edward Chaney]], \"Richard Lassels\", [[ODNB]], and idem, ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion'' (Geneva, 1985)}} Lassels's introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished \"an accomplished, consummate Traveller\": the [[Intellectualism|intellectual]], the [[Society|social]], the [[Ethics|ethical]] (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the [[Politics|political]].\n[[File:Jean Preudhomme.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton|Douglas, 8th Duke of Hamilton]], on his Grand Tour with his physician [[John Moore (Scottish physician)|Dr. John Moore]] and the latter's son [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John]]. A view of [[Geneva]] is in the distance where they stayed for two years. Painted by [[Jean Preudhomme]] in 1774.]]\n\nThe idea of travelling for the sake of curiosity and learning was a developing idea in the 17th century. With [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), it was argued, and widely accepted, that knowledge comes entirely from the external senses, that what one knows comes from the physical stimuli to which one has been exposed. Thus, one could \"use up\" the environment, taking from it all it offers, requiring a change of place. Travel, therefore, was necessary for one to develop the mind and expand knowledge of the world.\n\nAs a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat Grand Tour, the historian [[Edward Gibbon]] remarked that \"According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman.\" Consciously adapted for intellectual self-improvement, Gibbon was \"revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan\"; most Grand Tourists did not pause more than briefly in libraries. On the eve of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era he played a significant part in introducing, [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] wrote a vivid account of his Grand Tour that made Gibbon's unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.<ref>E. Chaney, \"Gibbon, Beckford and the Interpretation of Dreams, Waking Thoughts and Incidents\", The Beckford Society Annual Lectures (London, 2004), pp. 25\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe typical 18th-century stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands reporting his findings on human nature for those unfortunates who stayed at home. Recounting one's observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation; the Grand Tour flourished in this mindset.<ref>Paul Fussell (1987), p. 129.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Tour offered a [[liberal education]], and the opportunity to acquire things otherwise unavailable, lending an air of accomplishment and prestige to the traveller. Grand Tourists would return with crates full of books, works of art, scientific instruments, and cultural artefacts \u2013 from snuff boxes and paperweights, to altars, fountains, and statuary \u2013 to be displayed in libraries, [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], gardens, [[drawing rooms]], and galleries built for that purpose. The trappings of the Grand Tour, especially portraits of the traveller painted in continental settings, became the obligatory emblems of worldliness, gravitas and influence. Artists who particularly thrived on the Grand Tour market included [[Carlo Maratti]], who was first patronised by John Evelyn as early as 1645,<ref>E. Chaney, The Evolution of English Collecting</ref> [[Pompeo Batoni]] the [[portrait]]ist, and the [[vedutisti]] such as [[Canaletto]], [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]] and [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]. The less well-off could return with an album of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] etchings.\n\nThe \"perhaps\" in Gibbon's opening remark cast an ironic shadow over his resounding statement.<ref>Noted by Redford 1996, Preface.</ref> Critics of the Grand Tour derided its lack of adventure. \"The tour of Europe is a paltry thing\", said one 18th century critic, \"a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect\".<ref name=bd>Bohls & Duncan (2005)</ref> The Grand Tour was said to reinforce the old preconceptions and prejudices about national characteristics, as [[:fr:Jean_de_Gaillard|Jean Gailhard]]'s ''Compleat Gentleman'' (1678) observes: \"French courteous. Spanish lordly. Italian amorous. German clownish.\"<ref name=bd/> The deep suspicion with which Tour was viewed at home in England, where it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him, were epitomised in the sarcastic nativist view of the ostentatiously \"well-travelled\" [[maccaroni]] of the 1760s and 1770s.\n[[File:Shepherds beside Roman ruins.jpg|thumb|Northerners found the contrast between Roman ruins and modern peasants of the [[Roman Campagna]] an educational lesson in [[Vanity|vanities]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} (painting by [[Nicolaes Pietersz Berchem]], 1661, [[Mauritshuis]])]]\n\nAlso worth noticing is that the Grand Tour not only fostered stereotypes of the countries visited but also led to a dynamic of contrast between northern and southern Europe. By constantly depicting Italy as a \"picturesque place\", the travellers also unconsciously degraded Italy as a place of backwardness.<ref>Nelson Moe, \"Italy as Europe's South\", in The View from Vesuvius, Italian Culture and the Southern Question, University of California Press, 2002</ref> This unconscious degradation is best reflected in the famous verses of Lamartine in which Italy is depicted as a \"land of the past... where everything sleeps.\"<ref>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Italy Journey</ref>\n\nAfter the advent of steam-powered transportation around 1825, the Grand Tour custom continued, but it was of a qualitative difference \u2014 cheaper to undertake, safer, easier, open to anyone. During much of the 19th century, most educated young men of privilege undertook the Grand Tour. [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] came to be included in a more broadly defined circuit. Later, it became fashionable for young women as well; a trip to Italy, with a [[spinster]] aunt as [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], was part of the upper-class women's education, as in [[E. M. Forster]]'s novel ''[[A Room with a View]]''.\n\nBritish travellers were far from alone on the roads of Europe. On the contrary, from the mid-16th century the grand tour was established as an ideal way to finish off the education of young men in countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Grand Tour : adeliges Reisen und europ\u00e4ische Kultur vom 14. bis zum 18.

From there the tourist, usually accompanied by a tutor (known colloquially as a \"[[Bear-leader (guide)|bear-leader]]\") and (if wealthy enough) a troop of servants, could rent or acquire a [[Coach (carriage)|coach]] (which could be resold in any city \u2013 as in [[Giacomo Casanova]]'s travels \u2013 or disassembled and packed across the [[Alps]]), or he could opt to make the trip by riverboat as far as the Alps, either travelling up the [[Seine]] to Paris, or up the [[Rhine]] to [[Basel]].\n\nUpon hiring a French-speaking guide, as French was the dominant language of the elite in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, the tourist and his entourage would travel to [[Paris]]. There the traveller might undertake lessons in French, [[dancing]], [[fencing]], and [[Equestrianism|riding]]. The appeal of Paris lay in the sophisticated language and manners of French high society, including courtly behavior and fashion. This served to polish the young man's manners in preparation for a leadership position at home, often in government or [[diplomacy]].\n[[File:Robertspencer1641.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland]] (1640\u20131702), painted in classical dress in Rome by [[Carlo Maratti]]]]\n\nFrom Paris he would typically sojourn in urban [[Switzerland]], often in [[Geneva]] (the cradle of the [[Protestant Reformation]]) or [[Lausanne]].<ref name=ATR>{{cite web|last=Towner |first=John |title=THE GRAND TOUR A Key Phase in the History of Tourism |url=http://rosen.hospitality.ucf.edu/faculty/raywang/documents/HFT7715/History%20and%20tourism/The%20grand%20tour%20A%20key%20phase%20in%20the%20history%20of%20tourism.pdf |work=Annals of Tourism Research.

He contested the [[1946 Down by-election]] as a [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] candidate.\n\n==Bevanite==\n{{one source|section|date=July 2017}}\nDonnelly was chosen to fight [[Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Pembrokeshire]] for the Labour Party in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], which a good Labour candidate had narrowly failed to win in 1945 and where the sitting Member, [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]], was very popular, not merely because he was the son of [[David Lloyd George]]. Despite the general trend away from the Labour Party, Donnelly beat Lloyd George by playing on the fact that he was supporting the Conservatives, and won the seat by 129 votes.\n\nIn Parliament, he defined himself as \"an Englishman with an Irish name sitting for a Welsh seat\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/197740a7-6f91-3a83-aa8d-d2db0082d19a |title=Desmond Donnelly, mercurial but doomed |date=2013-04-09 |first=Phil |last=Carradice |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> and initially allied with [[Aneurin Bevan]]. He also made sure to build extensive contacts within his constituency, where he became very popular. Although his seat never became entirely safe, he was never taken to the wire. While serving as an MP, Donnelly upped his income by acting as a consultant to the engineering firms David Brown and Philips Industries and to the merchant bankers Hill Samuel.\n\n==Gaitskellite==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 1954, Donnelly fell out with Bevan over the issue of [[Germany|German]] rearmament which he considered necessary. He was also outspokenly anti-[[Soviet Union]], a position which intensified after he made trips to the [[Soviet bloc]]. After 1955, he became known as a vociferous opponent of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and a [[Gaitskellism|general supporter]] of [[Hugh Gaitskell]] as Labour leader.\n\nThis ensured his appointment as political correspondent for the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' from 1959, but Gaitskell's death in 1963 brought in [[Harold Wilson]] with whom Donnelly was not pleased; although his skills would have merited appointment to Wilson's government after the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], Wilson offered Donnelly nothing.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Donnelly decided to call for an alliance between the Labour Party and the Liberal Party. He also joined with another Labour MP, [[Woodrow Wyatt]], to publicly oppose the Labour Party policy of [[Nationalization|nationalising]] the [[Steel]] industry; given the narrow majority which Wilson's government had in its first term, their opposition would have been enough to vote down the plan, and any moves had to be postponed until after the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]] gave a landslide majority.\n\n==Labour rebel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nDonnelly began causing increasing trouble to the Labour Party whips after the election. He became chief political correspondent for the ''[[News of the World]]'' in 1967 which ensured his views were widely known. He heaped scorn on the government's handling of the economy and called for a fundamental change to the relation of the party to the [[trade union]]s \"in which the unions do not look on the Labour Party as their pet [[poodle]]\".\n\nThe final breach in relations came after spending cuts caused by [[devaluation]] of the [[Pound sterling]] in November 1967 forced the government to withdraw from defence commitments '[[east of Suez]]'. Donnelly resigned the Labour Party whip in the House of Commons on 18 January 1968. The Labour Party responded on 27 March by expelling him from membership of the party entirely.\n\n==Democratic Party==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nAt a meeting of the [[Monday Club]] in 1968, Donnelly received a two-minute standing ovation, and then told members \"Mr Wilson should resign and leave public life\". However he was not willing to join the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and instead set up his own party, initially known as 'Our Party' but later the [[Democratic Party (UK, 1969)|Democratic Party]]. In some respects the party's policy was to the right of the Conservatives, advocating the abolition of the [[welfare state]], sweeping changes to the taxation system, and the return of [[national service]]. The party fought five seats at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] but polled poorly. Donnelly himself lost Pembrokeshire to the Conservatives.\n\n==Later career==\nAbruptly, in April 1971, Donnelly announced that he had joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], without warning the members of the Democratic Party. He explained that the Conservative Party closely reflected his views on reform of the law relating to trades unions and [[European Union|EEC]] entry, and attended the Conservative Party conference that October as a delegate from [[Cities of London and Westminster (constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]]. He applied for, but did not get, the Conservative nomination for the [[1973 Hove by-election|Hove by-election]] in 1973, and was also rejected for [[Melton (UK Parliament constituency)|Melton]] for the next general election.\n\nIn addition to prolific journalism (he specialised in book reviews), Donnelly had gone into business after his defeat in 1970 and became chairman of ICPS Ltd and Managing Director of Practical Europe Ltd.<ref>{{cite book|title=Town and Country Planning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PNUAAAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=The Association}}</ref> In the recession of 1973 and 1974, his companies struggled financially and this combined with his failure to get back into the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as a Conservative to cause serious depression.\n\nDonnelly committed [[suicide]] in a hotel room at [[West Drayton]] near [[Heathrow Airport]] on 3 April 1974, by drinking a large amount of [[vodka]] and taking a massive [[drug overdose|overdose]] of [[barbiturates]].<ref name=\"Morgan2007\">{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

In 1928 he was the first of his family to return to Britain for his schooling in a century (accompanied by his mother; they lost contact with his father); he went to Brightlands School, Newnham-on-Severn, [[Gloucestershire]]. Later he attended [[Bembridge School]] (a [[public school (England)|public school]]) on the [[Isle of Wight]]. He first joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1936 after becoming interested in the ideas of [[William Morris]].\n\nHe did not go to university. As a keen sportsman, Donnelly became secretary of the London Grasshoppers Rugby Club on leaving school and while working as an office boy. At the age of 17 he set up the ''British Empire Cricket XI'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&cd=123&id=nxSCAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Desmond+Donnelly%22+dead+OR+died+OR+death&q=%22Desmond+Donnelly%22+ War games: the story of sport in World War Two] By Tony McCarthy. p. 54.</ref> which continued through the war years, supporting  [[cricket]], and raising funds for the Duke of Gloucester's Red Cross and the St John fund. He enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1939 and served as a [[Flying Officer]] with [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]]. Later he joined the 'Desert Air Force' in the [[North African Campaign]] and [[Italy]] where he rose to the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]].\n\n==On the left==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], Donnelly fought the constituency of [[Evesham (UK Parliament constituency)|Evesham]] in [[Worcestershire]] for [[Common Wealth Party|Common Wealth]], an idealistic [[socialism|socialist]] party generally regarded as to the left of Labour. Although there was no Labour Party candidate, Donnelly was narrowly pushed into third place by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate.\n\nCommon Wealth did not long survive the election and Donnelly rejoined Labour in September 1945. From 1945 to 1946 he lectured at the RAF Staff College. On leaving the RAF, Donnelly became assistant editor and later editor of ''Town and Country Planning'', the journal of the [[Town and Country Planning Association]].

He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1960.\n\nHe was created a life peer upon his retirement from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the [[Conservative Monday Club]]. He was the son-in-law of Conservative prime minister [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\n==Early and family life==\nAmery's father was [[Leo Amery]], a British statesman and Conservative politician. His brother, [[John Amery|John]], was hanged for [[treason]] having pleaded guilty to making recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/john_amery.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205041428/http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/john_amery.htm |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAmery was educated at [[The Eaton House Group of Schools#Eaton House Belgravia Pre-Preparatory|Eaton House]],<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Supermac: the life of Harold Macmillan|date=2011|publisher=Pimlico|isbn=9781844135417|location=London, UK|page=21|oclc=751719981}}</ref> [[Summer Fields School]], [[Eton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. While an [[undergraduate]], he had a brief romance with the novelist [[Barbara Pym]], who was some years his senior.<ref>Faber, David. ''Speaking for England''<!--page(s)--></ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nOn 26 January 1950, he married Catherine Macmillan (died 1991), daughter of [[Harold Macmillan]]. The couple had one son and three daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Military service==\nBefore the [[Second World War]] started, Amery was a war correspondent in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and later an attach\u00e9 for the British [[Foreign Office]] in [[Belgrade]]. After the war began, he joined the RAF as a sergeant in 1940 then was commissioned and transferred to the [[British Army]] on the [[General List]] in 1941, reaching the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]].\n\nHe spent 1941\u201342 in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, [[Malta]], [[Yugoslavia]]) and served as Liaison Officer to the [[Albanian Resistance of World War II|Albanian Resistance Movement]] in 1943\u201344 (\"The Musketeers\": Captain Julian Amery, Major [[David Smiley]] and Lieutenant-Colonel [[Neil McLean (politician)|Neil McLean]]). The following year, Amery went to China to work with General [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|Carton de Wiart]], then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Amery became a close friend of King [[Zog of Albania]] and described him as \"the cleverest man I have ever met\".<ref>Amery, Julian, ''Approach March: a Venture in Autobiography''. Hutchinson, 1973<!--publisher, page(s) needed--></ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAmery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as Conservative MP for [[Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston North]], going on to hold a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957\u201358) and for the Colonies (1958\u201360). He was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Air]] (1960\u201362), followed by a promotion to the post of [[Ministry of Aviation|Minister of Aviation]] (1962\u201364). In this role, Amery played a major role in developing the supersonic passenger service known as [[Concorde]].\n\nAmery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]], a seat he would hold until 1992 when he retired. On 8 July 1992, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Amery of [[Lustleigh]]''', of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in the County of [[Lancashire]] and of [[Brighton]] in the County of [[East Sussex]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52988|date=13 July 1992|page=11759}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, Amery held three ministerial posts: [[First Commissioner of Works|Minister for Public Works]] (1970), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970\u201372) and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972\u201374).\n\n===Monday Club===\nFor 30 years, Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], where he became friendly with General Sir [[Walter Walker (British Army officer)|Walter Walker]], subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, ''The Next Domino''.\n\nHe was Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist [[Geoffrey Stewart-Smith]]'s book, ''No Vision Here''. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in [[Trafalgar Square]], held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the [[South Africa]]n cricket tour.\n\nJulian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the [[Savoy Hotel]], London, in January 1974 and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in [[Birmingham]] in March 1975.\n\n===Political views===\nAmery was in favour of entry to the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]] and also of the [[nuclear deterrent]]. Both caused some discord between himself and his old friend [[Enoch Powell]]. He was, however, regarded by most as an [[imperialist]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1963, Amery took charge of [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]]'s campaign for leadership of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].<ref>cf.Heffer, 189; 324</ref>\n\nIn early 1975, he took part in a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debate on the [[Trades Unions Congress]]'s invitation to [[Alexander Shelepin]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that \"more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s 1995 memoir, ''[[The Path to Power (Margaret Thatcher)|The Path to Power]]'', when [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government proposed [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] for [[Scotland]] in 1976, \"Julian Amery and [[Maurice Macmillan]] proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAlthough he was Harold Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count [[Nikolai Tolstoy]] published ''[[The Minister and the Massacres]]'' in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the 1945 Bleiburg repatriations and the Cossack repatriations. Amery stated that the repatriations were \"one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Quotes==\n\"The prosperity of our people rests really on the [[oil]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[rubber]] and tin of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], and the [[gold]], [[copper]] and [[precious metal]]s of South- and [[Central Africa]]. As long as we have access to these; as long as we can realize the investments we have there; as long as we trade with this part of the world, we shall be prosperous. If the [[communist]]s [or anyone else] were to take them over, we would lose the lot. Governments like [[Colonel Nasser]]'s in [[Egypt]] are just as dangerous.\"<ref>[http://www.pehi.eu/organisations/1001_Club.htm The 1001 Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201184618/http://www.pehi.eu/organisations/1001_Club.htm|date=1 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* Copping, Robert, ''The Story of The Monday Club \u2013 The First Decade'', April 1972 (P/B); and ''The Monday Club \u2013 Crisis and After'' (Foreword by [[John Biggs-Davison]], M.P.), May 1975, (P/B), pps:12 & 24, published by the Current Affairs Information Service.\n* Amery, Julian, M.P., et al., ''Rhodesia and the Threat to the West'' Monday Club, London, 1976 (P/B).\n* Gash, Norman, with Donald Southgate, David Dilks, and John Ramsden; introduction by Lord Butler, K.G.,P.C., ''The Conservatives \u2013 A History of their Origins to 1965'' London, 1977, pps:268-9. {{ISBN|0-04-942157-3}}\n* Amery, Julian, PC, MP, ''The Next Four Years'', in the ''[[Primrose League]] Gazette'', vol.87, no.4, October 1983, London.\n* Amery, Julian, MP, The Rt.

{{post-nominals|country=GBR|PC}} (27 March 1919 \u2013 3 September 1996), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], who served as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for 39 of the 42 years between 1950 and 1992. He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1960.\n\nHe was created a life peer upon his retirement from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the [[Conservative Monday Club]]. He was the son-in-law of Conservative prime minister [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\n==Early and family life==\nAmery's father was [[Leo Amery]], a British statesman and Conservative politician. His brother, [[John Amery|John]], was hanged for [[treason]] having pleaded guilty to making recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/john_amery.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205041428/http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/john_amery.htm |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAmery was educated at [[The Eaton House Group of Schools#Eaton House Belgravia Pre-Preparatory|Eaton House]],<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Supermac: the life of Harold Macmillan|date=2011|publisher=Pimlico|isbn=9781844135417|location=London, UK|page=21|oclc=751719981}}</ref> [[Summer Fields School]], [[Eton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

The couple had one son and three daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Military service==\nBefore the [[Second World War]] started, Amery was a war correspondent in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and later an attach\u00e9 for the British [[Foreign Office]] in [[Belgrade]]. After the war began, he joined the RAF as a sergeant in 1940 then was commissioned and transferred to the [[British Army]] on the [[General List]] in 1941, reaching the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]].\n\nHe spent 1941\u201342 in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, [[Malta]], [[Yugoslavia]]) and served as Liaison Officer to the [[Albanian Resistance of World War II|Albanian Resistance Movement]] in 1943\u201344 (\"The Musketeers\": Captain Julian Amery, Major [[David Smiley]] and Lieutenant-Colonel [[Neil McLean (politician)|Neil McLean]]). The following year, Amery went to China to work with General [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|Carton de Wiart]], then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Amery became a close friend of King [[Zog of Albania]] and described him as \"the cleverest man I have ever met\".<ref>Amery, Julian, ''Approach March: a Venture in Autobiography''. Hutchinson, 1973<!--publisher, page(s) needed--></ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAmery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as Conservative MP for [[Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston North]], going on to hold a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957\u201358) and for the Colonies (1958\u201360). He was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Air]] (1960\u201362), followed by a promotion to the post of [[Ministry of Aviation|Minister of Aviation]] (1962\u201364). In this role, Amery played a major role in developing the supersonic passenger service known as [[Concorde]].\n\nAmery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]], a seat he would hold until 1992 when he retired. On 8 July 1992, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Amery of [[Lustleigh]]''', of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in the County of [[Lancashire]] and of [[Brighton]] in the County of [[East Sussex]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52988|date=13 July 1992|page=11759}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, Amery held three ministerial posts: [[First Commissioner of Works|Minister for Public Works]] (1970), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970\u201372) and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972\u201374).\n\n===Monday Club===\nFor 30 years, Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], where he became friendly with General Sir [[Walter Walker (British Army officer)|Walter Walker]], subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, ''The Next Domino''.\n\nHe was Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist [[Geoffrey Stewart-Smith]]'s book, ''No Vision Here''. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in [[Trafalgar Square]], held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the [[South Africa]]n cricket tour.\n\nJulian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the [[Savoy Hotel]], London, in January 1974 and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in [[Birmingham]] in March 1975.\n\n===Political views===\nAmery was in favour of entry to the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]] and also of the [[nuclear deterrent]]. Both caused some discord between himself and his old friend [[Enoch Powell]]. He was, however, regarded by most as an [[imperialist]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1963, Amery took charge of [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]]'s campaign for leadership of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].<ref>cf.Heffer, 189; 324</ref>\n\nIn early 1975, he took part in a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debate on the [[Trades Unions Congress]]'s invitation to [[Alexander Shelepin]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that \"more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s 1995 memoir, ''[[The Path to Power (Margaret Thatcher)|The Path to Power]]'', when [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government proposed [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] for [[Scotland]] in 1976, \"Julian Amery and [[Maurice Macmillan]] proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAlthough he was Harold Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count [[Nikolai Tolstoy]] published ''[[The Minister and the Massacres]]'' in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the 1945 Bleiburg repatriations and the Cossack repatriations. Amery stated that the repatriations were \"one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Quotes==\n\"The prosperity of our people rests really on the [[oil]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[rubber]] and tin of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], and the [[gold]], [[copper]] and [[precious metal]]s of South- and [[Central Africa]]. As long as we have access to these; as long as we can realize the investments we have there; as long as we trade with this part of the world, we shall be prosperous. If the [[communist]]s [or anyone else] were to take them over, we would lose the lot.

Party (UK)|Labour]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976.\n\nEntering Parliament in 1945, Wilson was appointed a [[parliamentary secretary]] in the [[Attlee ministry]] and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks; he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] in 1947 and was elevated to Cabinet shortly thereafter as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. In opposition to the next Conservative government, he served as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor]] (1955&ndash;1961) and [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] (1961&ndash;1963). After Labour Party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] died suddenly in 1963, Wilson won the subsequent [[1963 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election]]. After narrowly winning the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], Wilson saw an increased majority in a snap [[1966 United Kingdom general election|election in 1966]].\n\nWilson's [[Labour government, 1964\u20131970|first period as Prime Minister]] coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity, though hindered by significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments. In 1969 he [[Operation Banner|sent British troops to Northern Ireland]]. After losing the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] to [[Edward Heath]], he spent four years as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] before the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until another [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election in October]], resulting in a narrow Labour victory. A period of economic crisis had begun to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister. Wilson's approach to [[socialism]] was moderate compared with others in his party at the time, emphasising programmes aimed at increasing opportunity in society through relatively indirect means rather than the more direct socialist goal of promoting wider [[public ownership]] of industry and workers' control of production. He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution's stated dedication to [[public ownership]] as a stepping stone towards this goal, though he did not formally disavow it. Himself a member of the party's [[soft left]], Wilson joked about leading a cabinet made up mostly of [[Social democracy|social democrats]], comparing himself to a [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary presiding over a [[Tsarist]] cabinet, but there was little to divide him ideologically from the social democratic cabinet majority.<ref>''The Labour government, 1974\u201379: political aims and economic reality'' by Martin Holmes.</ref><ref name=\"labour1945\">''The Labour Party since 1945'' by Eric Shaw.</ref>\n\nOverall, historians evaluate Wilson as having led his party through difficult political issues with considerable skill. Important issues of the time included the role of public ownership, membership of the [[European Economic Community]], and involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], in which he refused to allow the use of British combat troops, although he maintained an expensive military presence [[east of Suez]].<ref name=\"guardian-19950525\">{{cite news|first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries |title=Harold Wilson &#124; Politics |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 1 July 2005|accessdate=10 April 2014 |location=London}}</ref> His stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance, applying technology more democratically, and reducing inequality was largely unfulfilled. He seemed to some observers to lose his energy and drive in his second premiership and found it difficult to mediate disputes concerning European integration and trade union rights.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson'' (1992), pp. 604\u20135, 648, 656, 670\u201377, 689.</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nWilson was born at Warneford Road, [[Huddersfield]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 11 March 1916. He came from a political family: his father James Herbert Wilson (1882\u20131971) was a works chemist who had been active in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], going as far as to be [[Winston Churchill]]'s deputy election agent in his 1908 [[by-election]] before joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. His mother Ethel (''n\u00e9e'' Seddon; 1882\u20131957) was a schoolteacher before her marriage; in 1901 her brother [[Harold Seddon]] settled in [[Western Australia]] and became a local political leader. When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a much-reproduced photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of [[10 Downing Street]]. At the age of ten he went with his family to Australia, where he became fascinated with the pomp and glamour of politics. On the way home he told his mother, \"I am going to be Prime Minister.\"<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson'' (1992), pp. 3\u201320, quote p. 20.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nWilson won a scholarship to attend [[Royds Hall School|Royds Hall Grammar School]], his local [[grammar school]] (now a [[comprehensive school]]) in [[Huddersfield]] in Yorkshire. His father, working as an industrial chemist, was made redundant in December 1930, and it took him nearly two years to find work; he moved to [[Spital, Merseyside|Spital]] in Cheshire, on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in order to do so. Wilson was educated in the Sixth Form at the [[Wirral Grammar School for Boys]], where he became [[Head Boy]].\n\n[[File:Wilson banner.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Order of the Garter|Garter]] banner of Harold Wilson in the chapel at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]], Oxford, where he studied Modern History]]\nWilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]]; this, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study Modern History at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], from 1934. At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was strongly influenced by [[G. D. H. Cole]]. His politics tutor, [[R. B. McCallum]], considered Wilson as the best student he ever had.<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Labour People: Leaders and Lieutenants, Hardie to Kinnock'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 247.</ref> He graduated in PPE ([[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]) with \"an outstanding first class Bachelor of Arts degree, with alphas on every paper\" in the final examinations, and a series of major academic awards.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson,'' (1993), p. 59.</ref> Biographer [[Roy Jenkins]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Academically his results put him among prime ministers in the category of [[Robert Peel|Peel]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], [[H.

He was a lecturer in [[Economic History]] at [[New College, Oxford|New College]] from 1937, and a research [[fellow]] at [[University College, Oxford|University College]].\n\n===Marriage===\nOn New Year's Day 1940, in the chapel of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], he married [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Baldwin]], who remained his wife until his death. Mary Wilson became a published poet. They had two sons, [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin]] and Giles (named after [[Giles Alington (academic)|Giles Alington]]); Robin became a professor of Mathematics, and Giles became a teacher and later a train driver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/son-of-former-pm-harold-wilson-swaps-teaching-for-a-career-as-train-driver-7210307.html|title=Son of former PM Harold Wilson swaps teaching for a career as train driver|work=[[The Evening Standard]]|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref> In their twenties, his sons were under a kidnap threat from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] because of his father's prominence.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/and-you-thought-your-family-politics-were-bad-what-s-it-like-to-be-the-child-of-a-politician-8572555.html\n| title = And you thought your family politics were bad... what's it like to be the child of a politician?| accessdate =29 November 2019\n| date = 19 September 2006\n| last = Usborne\n| first = Simon\n| work=The Independent |location=London\n}}</ref>\n\n===War service===\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilson volunteered for military service but was classed as a specialist and moved into the civil service instead. For much of this time, he was a research assistant to [[William Beveridge]], the Master of University College, working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle. Wilson later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry. He was Director of Economics and Statistics at the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]] in 1943\u201344, and received an [[OBE]] for his services.<ref>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|first=David |last=Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=236, 237|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref>\n\nHe was to remain passionately interested in statistics, becoming a Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Peter G. |title=Obituary: James Harold Wilson 1916\u201395. |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

He was instrumental as Prime Minister in appointing [[Claus Moser]] as head of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]], and was president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1972\u201373.\n\n==Member of Parliament (1945\u201364)==\nAs the war drew to an end, he searched for a seat to fight at the impending general election. He was selected for the constituency of [[Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Ormskirk]], then held by [[Stephen King-Hall]]. Wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called, and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the Civil Service. He served as [[Praelector]] in Economics at University College between his resignation and his election to the House of Commons. He also used this time to write ''A New Deal for Coal'', which used his wartime experience to argue for nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue.\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], Wilson won his seat in the Labour landslide. To his surprise, he was immediately appointed to the government by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Two years later, he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]], in which capacity he made several official trips to the [[Soviet Union]] to negotiate supply contracts.\n\nThe boundaries of his Ormskirk constituency was significantly altered before the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1950]]. He stood instead for the new seat of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] near Liverpool, and was narrowly elected; he served there for 33 years until 1983.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HwyCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=wilson+mp+for+ormskirk#v=onepage&q=wilson%20mp%20for%20ormskirk&f=false|title=The Routledge Companion to Britain in the Twentieth Century|isbn=9781134476954|last1=Clapson|first1=Mark|date=23 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Cabinet Minister, 1947\u201351===\nWilson was appointed [[President of the Board of Trade]] on 29 September 1947, becoming, at the age of 31, the youngest member of a British Cabinet in the 20th century. He took a lead in abolishing some wartime rationing, which he referred to as a \"bonfire of controls\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Roy Jenkins, 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916\u20131995)', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000, accessed 3 August 2008]</ref>\n\nIn mid-1949, with Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Stafford Cripps]] having gone to Switzerland in an attempt to recover his health, Wilson was one of a group of three young ministers, all of them former economics dons and wartime civil servants, convened to advise Prime Minister Attlee on financial matters. The others were [[Douglas Jay]] ([[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]]) and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] ([[Minister of Fuel and Power]]), both of whom soon grew to distrust him. Jay wrote of Wilson's role in the debates over whether or not to devalue sterling that \"he changed sides three times within eight days and finished up facing both ways\". Wilson was given the task during his Swiss holiday of taking a letter to Cripps informing him of the decision to devalue, to which Cripps had been opposed.<ref>Dell 1997, pp. 120, 122.</ref> Wilson had tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Although a successful minister, he was regarded as self-important.

At this time, Wilson was not yet regarded as a heavyweight politician: [[Hugh Dalton]] referred to him scornfully as \"Nye [Bevan]'s dog\".<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 233.</ref>\n\nAfter Labour lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 election]], he became the Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's political group. At the bitter Morecambe Conference in late 1952, Wilson was one of the Bevanites elected as constituency representatives to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), whilst senior right-wingers such as Dalton and [[Herbert Morrison]] were voted off.<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 275.</ref>\n\n===Shadow Cabinet, 1954\u201363===\nWilson had never made much secret that his support of the left-wing Aneurin Bevan was opportunistic. In early 1954, Bevan resigned from the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) over Labour's support for the setting-up of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by [[Richard Crossman]], but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 289.</ref>\n\nWilson's course in intra-party matters in the 1950s and early 1960s left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left or the right in the Labour Party. Despite his earlier association with Bevan, in [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|1955]] he backed [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the right-wing candidate in internal Labour Party terms, against Bevan for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,563492,00.html |title=Harold Wilson: Leading Labour beyond pipe dreams |first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 May 1995 |accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> Gaitskell appointed him [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1955, and he proved to be very effective.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 211\u201312.</ref> One of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the Government's Finance Bill in 1955, and his speeches as Shadow Chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit.

Bevan had died in July 1960, so Wilson established himself as a leader of the Labour left by launching an opportunistic but unsuccessful [[1960 Labour Party leadership election|challenge to Gaitskell's leadership in November 1960]]. Wilson would later be moved to the position of [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] in 1961, before he challenged for the deputy leadership in 1962 but was defeated by [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]].\n\n===Opposition Leader, 1963\u201364===\nGaitskell died in January 1963, just as the Labour Party had begun to unite and appeared to have a very good chance of winning the next election, with the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan Government]] running into trouble.

He argued that \"the Britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or for outdated measures on either side of industry\".

Wilson's government also made significant reforms to [[education in the United Kingdom|education]], most notably the expansion of [[comprehensive education]] and the creation of the [[Open University]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\n====Economic policies====\nWilson's government put faith in [[economic planning]] as a way to solve Britain's economic problems. The government's strategy involved setting up a [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] (DEA) which would draw up a National Plan which was intended to promote growth and investment. Wilson believed that scientific progress was the key to economic and social advancement, as such he famously referred to the \"white heat of technology\", in reference to the modernisation of British industry. This was to be achieved through a new [[Ministry of Technology]] (shortened to 'Mintech') which would co-ordinate research and development and support the swift adoption of new technology by industry, aided by government-funded infrastructure improvements.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\nIn practice however, events derailed much of the initial optimism. Upon coming to power, the government was informed that they had inherited an exceptionally large deficit of \u00a3800 million on Britain's external [[balance of trade]]. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election. Immediately the pound came under enormous pressure, and many economists advocated [[devaluation]] of the pound in response, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as \"the party of devaluation\", the government instead opted to deal with the problem by imposing a temporary surcharge on imports, and a series of deflationary measures designed to reduce demand and therefore the inflow of imports.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> In the latter half of 1967, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a rise in unemployment.<ref name=\"inequality\">{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Peter |editor-last=Bosanquet |editor-first=Nicholas |publisher=[[Fabian Society]] |title=Labour and inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays |isbn=978-0-7163-4004-1|year=1972 }}</ref> \n\nAfter a costly battle, market pressures forced the government to devalue the pound by 14% from $2.80 to $2.40 in November 1967.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast soon after in which he assured listeners that the \"pound in your pocket\" had not lost its value.<ref>{{cite news |title=1967: Wilson defends 'pound in your pocket' |date=19 November 1967 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/19/newsid_3208000/3208396.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures which ensured resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption, successfully restored the trade balance to surplus by 1969. In retrospect Wilson has been widely criticised for not devaluing earlier, however he believed there were strong arguments against it, including the fear that it would set off a round of competitive devaluations, and concern about the impact price rises following a devaluation would have on people on low incomes.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\nThe government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. The National Plan produced by the DEA in 1965 targeted an annual growth rate of 3.8%, however under the restrained circumstances the actual average rate of growth between 1964 and 1970 was a far more modest 2.2%. The DEA itself was wound up in 1969. The government's other main initiative Mintech did have some success at switching research and development spending from military to civilian purposes, and of achieving increases in industrial productivity, although persuading industry to adopt new technology proved more difficult than had been hoped.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth,<ref>An influential study at the time, [[Andrew Shonfield]]'s ''Modern Capitalism'' (OUP, 1965), provided intellectual backing for the belief that indicative planning largely underlay the superior growth performance of France and Germany compared to the UK.</ref> embodied in the DEA and Mintech, was at the time by no means confined to the Labour Party. Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the [[National Economic Development Council]] (known as \"Neddy\") and its regional counterparts (the \"little Neddies\").<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened and the number of \"little Neddies\" was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970. The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, a connexion not always publicly grasped, under [[Tony Benn]].<ref name=\"ReferenceN\">''The Labour Government 1964\u201370'' by Brian Lapping.</ref> \n\nThe continued relevance of industrial [[nationalisation]] (a centrepiece of the post-War Labour government's programme) had been a key point of contention in Labour's internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s. Wilson's predecessor as leader, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy head-on, with a proposal to expunge [[Clause Four]] (the public ownership clause) from the party's constitution, but had been forced to climb down. Wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach: No significant expansion of public ownership took place under Wilson's government, however he placated the party's left wing by renationalising the steel industry in 1967 (which had been denationalised by the Conservatives in the 1950s) creating the [[British Steel Corporation]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\nOne innovation of the Wilson government was the creation in 1968 of the [[Girobank]], a publicly owned bank which operated via the [[Post Office]] network: As most working-class people in the 1960s didn't have bank accounts, this was designed to serve their needs, as such it was billed as the \"people's bank\".<ref>{{cite web |title=THE NATIONAL GIRO |url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/ea8cf00b-5d7e-4c7c-b8fe-264110303bd1 |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> Girobank was a long-term success, surviving until 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Girobank disappears in A&L brand makeover |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2857020/Girobank-disappears-in-AandL-brand-makeover.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=21 January 2020 |date=7 July 2003}}</ref> \n\nWilson's government presided over a rate of [[unemployment]] which was low by historic (and later) standards but did rise during his period in office. Between 1964-66 the average rate of unemployment was 1.6%, while between 1966-70 the average stood at 2.5%.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> He had entered power at a time when unemployment stood at around 400,000. It still stood at 371,000 by early 1966 after a steady fall during 1965, but by March 1967 it stood at 631,000. It fell again towards the end of the decade, standing at 582,000 by the time of the general election in June 1970.<ref>[http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml Socialist Studies \u2013 Capitalism In Crisis \u2013 Unemployment In The 1930's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028013514/http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml |date=28 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of the economic difficulties faced by Wilson's government, it was  able to achieve important advances in a number of domestic policy areas. As reflected by Harold Wilson in 1971:\n\n{{quote|It was a government which faced disappointment after disappointment and none greater than the economic restraints in our ability to carry through the social revolution to which we were committed at the speed we would have wished. Yet, despite those restraints and the need to transfer resources from domestic expenditure, private and public, to the needs of our export markets, we carried through an expansion in the social services, health, welfare and housing, unparalleled in our history.<ref>Harold Wilson, The Labour Government 1964\u20131970: A Personal Record</ref>}}\n\n====Social issues====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Social issues}}\nA number of liberalising social reforms were passed through parliament during Wilson's first period in government. These dealt with the death penalty, homosexual acts, abortion, censorship and the voting age. There were new restrictions on immigration. Wilson personally, coming culturally from a provincial non-conformist background, showed no particular enthusiasm for much of this agenda.<ref>''The Battle of Britain: The Home Front'', by George Goldsmith Carter.</ref>\n\n====Education====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Education}}\nEducation held special significance for a socialist of Wilson's generation, in view of its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, for the first time in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''The Decade of Disillusion: British Politics in the Sixties'', edited by David Mckie and Chris Cook.</ref> Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the [[Robbins Report]], a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.\n\nWilson promoted the concept of an [[Open University]], to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning. His political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Baroness Lee]], the widow of [[Aneurin Bevan]].<ref name=\"ponting\">''Breach of Promise \u2013 Labour in Power, 1964\u201370'' by Clive Ponting.</ref> By 1981, 45,000 students had received degrees through the Open University.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Money was also channelled into local-authority run colleges of education.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nWilson's record on secondary education is, by contrast, highly controversial. Pressure grew for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the \"[[eleven-plus exam|eleven-plus]]\", and replacement with [[Comprehensive school]]s which would serve the full range of children (see the article '[[grammar schools debate]]'). Comprehensive education became Labour Party policy. From 1966 to 1970, the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10% to over 30%.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Changing party policy in Britain: an introduction'' by Richard Kelly.</ref>\n\nLabour pressed local authorities to convert grammar schools into comprehensives. Conversion continued on a large scale during the subsequent Conservative [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, although the Secretary of State, [[Margaret Thatcher]], ended the compulsion of local governments to convert.\n\nA major controversy that arose during Wilson's first government was the decision that the government could not fulfil its long-held promise to raise the school leaving age to 16, because of the investment required in infrastructure, such as extra classrooms and teachers.\n\nOverall, public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of GNP from 4.8% in 1964 to 5.9% in 1968, and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967.<ref>''A Short History Of The Labour Party'' by Henry Pelling.</ref> The percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly, and the student population increased by over 10% each year. Pupil-teacher ratios were also steadily reduced. As a result of the first Wilson government's educational policies, opportunities for working-class children were improved, while overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964.<ref name=\"socialists1\">''Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity'' by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice.</ref> As summarised by Brian Lapping,\n\n\"The years 1964\u201370 were largely taken up with creating extra places in universities, polytechnics, technical colleges, colleges of education: preparing for the day when a new Act would make it the right of a student, on leaving school, to have a place in an institution of further education.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Wilson was created the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the newly created [[University of Bradford]], a position he held until 1985.\n\n====Housing====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Housing}}\nHousing was a major policy area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than in the last six years of the previous Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total,<ref name=\"shorthistory\">''A Short History of the Labour Party'' by Alastair J. Reid and Henry Pelling.</ref> while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3&nbsp;million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970,<ref name=\"ponting\"/> To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments).<ref>''Housing policy: an introduction'' by Paul N. Balchin and Maureen Rhoden.</ref> This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''Capitalism and public policy in the UK'' by Tom Burden and Mike Campbell.</ref> and enabling more people to become owner occupiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=166 |title=Speech Archive |publisher=British Political Speech |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market.<ref>''The Evolution of the British Welfare State'' by Derek Fraser.</ref>\n\nSignificant emphasis was also placed on town planning, with new conservation areas introduced and a new generation of new towns built, notably [[Milton Keynes]]. The New Towns Acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority (through its ministries) to designate any area of land as a site for a [[new town]].<ref name=\"byrne1\">''Social Services: Made Simple'' by Tony Byrne, BA, BSc(Econ.), and Colin F.

Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which they would be able to buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme.<ref name=\"cook\">''The decade of disillusion: British politics in the '60s'' by David McKie and Chris Cook.</ref> In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational Priority Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived. A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational Priority Areas).<ref name=\"taylor\"/> From 1968 to 1970, 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme.<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\n====Social Services and welfare====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Social Services and welfare}}\n[[File:This is a photograph of Harold Wilson visiting an Retirement Home in Washington, UK. The photograph was taken at some point in the late 1960's.

[[Prescription charges]] for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of [[National Assistance]] (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed [[Supplementary Benefit]]. The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''Labour's First Century'' by [[Duncan Tanner]], [[Pat Thane]] and Nick Tiratsoo.</ref>\n\nThe widow's earning rule was also abolished,<ref name=\"ponting\"/> while a range of new social benefits was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who were considered to be unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a \"long-term\" allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added \"for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4wxjQFu2zsMC&pg=PA471&dq=From+1966,+following+a+recommendation+of+the+McCorquodale#v=onepage&q=From%201966%2C%20following%20a%20recommendation%20of%20the%20McCorquodale&f=false|title=Social Security Law in Context|isbn=9780198763086|last1=Harris|first1=Neville S.|year=2000}}</ref> Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity,<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmsocsec/56/9112407.htm |title=House of Commons \u2013 Social Security \u2013 Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968.<ref name=\"cook\"/> From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Labour Party (Great Britain).

This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and a significant increase in a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951\u201364 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\nThe [[1966 Doctor's Charter]] introduced allowances for rent and ancillary staff, significantly increased the pay scales, and changed the structure of payments to reflect \"both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i.e. group practice.\" These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in the increased use of ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a growth in the number of health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/> The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds for surgery, rents, and rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs. In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPs (since these doctors, the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, \"merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality).<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nIn 1967, local authorities were empowered to provide free family planning advice and means-tested contraceptive devices.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/><ref>''General practice under the National Health Service 1948\u20131997'' by Irvine Loudon, John Horder, Charles Webster.</ref> In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled.<ref name=\"shorthistory\"/> The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 empowered local authorities to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body.

Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed for the first time at increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at \u00a31.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.<ref name=\"ponting\"/>\n\nRegional unemployment differentials were narrowed, and spending on regional infrastructure was significantly increased. Between 1965\u201366 and 1969\u201370, yearly expenditure on new construction (including power stations, roads, schools, hospitals and housing) rose by 41% in the United Kingdom as a whole. Subsidies were also provided for various industries (such as [[shipbuilding]] in [[Clydeside]]), which helped to prevent a number of job losses. It is estimated that, between 1964 and 1970, 45,000 government jobs were created outside London, 21,000 of which were located in the Development Areas.<ref name=\"beckerman\"/> The Local Employment Act, passed in March 1970, embodied the government's proposals for assistance to 54 \"intermediate\" employment exchange areas not classified as full \"development\" areas.<ref name=\"Britannica1971\">''Britannica Book of the Year 1971'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc., William Benton (Publisher).</ref>\n\nFunds allocated to regional assistance more than doubled, from \u00a340&nbsp;million in 1964/65 to \u00a382&nbsp;million in 1969/70, and from 1964 to 1970, the number of factories completed was 50% higher than from 1960 to 1964, which helped to reduce unemployment in development areas. In 1970, the unemployment rate in development areas was 1.67 times the national average, compared to 2.21 times in 1964. Although national rates of unemployment were higher in 1970 than in the early 1960s, unemployment rates in the development areas were lower and had not increased for three years.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Altogether, the impact of the first Wilson government's regional development policies was such that, according to one historian, the period 1963 to 1970 represented \"the most prolonged, most intensive, and most successful attack ever launched on regional problems in Britain.\"<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\n====International development====\nA new Ministry of Overseas Development was established, with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interest-free loans for the poorest countries.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> The Minister of Overseas Development, [[Barbara Castle]], set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries, \"a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones.\" Loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time. In addition, Castle was instrumental in setting up an Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex to devise ways of tackling global socio-economic inequalities. Overseas aid suffered from the austerity measures introduced by the first Wilson government in its last few years in office, with British aid as a percentage of GNP falling from 0.53% in 1964 to 0.39% in 1969.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\n====Taxation====\nWilson's government made a variety of changes to the tax system. Largely under the influence of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born economists [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[Thomas Balogh]], an idiosyncratic [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. (The rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential.) The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer-term significance, [[capital gains tax]] (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.co.uk/Changes-To-Capital-Gains-Tax.htm |title=Warr & Co Chartered Accountants \u2013 Article \u2013 Changes To Capital Gains Tax |publisher=Warr.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531082945/http://www.warr.co.uk/Changes-To-Capital-Gains-Tax.htm |archivedate=31 May 2009  }}</ref> Across his two periods in office, Wilson presided over significant increases in the overall tax burden in the UK. In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor [[Denis Healey]] partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1974|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'unearned' income (investments and dividends) could add up to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top rate of income tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn25.pdf |title=IFS: Long-Term trends in British Taxation and Spending |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> \n\nVarious changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly.<ref name=\"inequality\"/> In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZvhMJWK930C&pg=PA129&dq=harold+wilson+widows+tax+concessions+1967#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20widows%20tax%20concessions%201967&f=false|title=Sinners?

Apart from the age relief, further adjustments in these concessions were implemented in 1970.<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\n1968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents. According to Michael Meacher, this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families, in otherwise identical circumstances, paid differing amounts of tax \"simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent, while in the other case the grandparent's identical property was inherited by the parent.\"<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\nIn the 1969 budget, income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowest paid and reduced for a further 600,000 people,<ref name=\"Crossman\"/> while in the government's last budget (introduced in 1970), two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether.<ref>\"Le contrat dans les pays anglo-saxons: th\u00e9ories et pratiques\" by Jean-Louis Breteau.</ref>\n\n====Liberal reforms====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Liberal reforms}}\nA wide range of liberal measures were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The [[Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970]] made provision for the welfare of children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/> This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage.<ref name=\"Longman\"/> That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] was passed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Another important reform, the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]], granted 'equal validity' to the declining [[Welsh language]] and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts.<ref name=\"shorthistory\"/> The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969, passed in response to the [[Aberfan disaster]], made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsUK/planning/legislation/minewaste.html |title=Legislation & policy: mineral ownership &#124; Planning &#124; MineralsUK |publisher=Bgs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In 1967, [[corporal punishment]] in borstals and prisons was abolished.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oVH0fVcMx5cC&pg=PP149&dq=UK+corporal+punishment+1948#v=onepage&q=UK%20corporal%20punishment%201948&f=false |title=Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951\u20131970 \u2013 Brian Harrison \u2013 Google Books |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014|isbn=9780191606786 |last1=Harrison |first1=Brian }}</ref> 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from \u00a37.7 million in 1964/64 to \u00a315.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over \u00a32 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968.<ref name=\"Labour 1968\"/>\n \nThe [[Commons Registration Act 1965]] provided for the registration of all [[common land]] and [[village green]]s, whilst under the Countryside Act 1968, local authorities could provide facilities \"for enjoyment of such lands to which the public has access\".<ref name=\"byrne1\"/> The Family Provision Act 1966 amended a series of pre-existing estate laws mainly related to persons who died interstate. The legislation increased the amount that could be paid to surviving spouses if a will had not been left, and also expanded upon the jurisdiction of county courts, which were given the jurisdiction of high courts under certain circumstances when handling matters of estate. The rights of adopted children were also improved with certain wording changed in the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938 to bestow upon them the same rights as natural-born children. In 1968, the [[Nurseries and Child-Minders Regulation Act 1948]] was updated to include more categories of childminders.<ref>''Family day care: international perspectives on policy, practice and quality'' by Ann Mooney and June Statham.</ref> A year later, the Family Law Reform Act 1969 was passed, which allowed people born outside marriage to inherit on the intestacy of either parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/overview/legitimacyadoption/ |title=Marriage: legitimacy and adoption \u2013 UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> In 1967, [[homosexuality]] was partially decriminalised by the passage of the [[Sexual Offences Act]].<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> The [[Public Records Act 1967]] also introduced a [[thirty-year rule]] for access to public records, replacing a previous fifty-year rule.<ref name=\"SeldonHickson\">''New Labour, Old Labour: The Wilson and Callaghan Governments, 1974\u201379'' edited by Anthony Seldon and Kevin Hickson.</ref>\n====Industrial relations====\nWilson made periodic attempts to mitigate inflation, largely through wage-price controls\u2014better known in Britain as \"prices and [[incomes policy]]\".<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> (As with indicative planning, such controls\u2014though now generally out of favour\u2014were widely adopted at that time by governments of different ideological complexions, including the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration in the United States.) Partly as a result of this reliance, the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes, with late-night \"beer and sandwiches at Number Ten\" an almost routine culmination to such episodes. Among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during Wilson's periods in office was a six-week stoppage by the [[National Union of Seamen]], beginning shortly after Wilson's [[1966 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1966]], and conducted, he claimed, by \"politically motivated men\".\n\nWith public frustration over strikes mounting, Wilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law), which were outlined in a White Paper \"[[In Place of Strife]]\" put forward by the Employment Secretary [[Barbara Castle]]. Following a confrontation with the [[Trades Union Congress]], which strongly opposed the proposals, and internal dissent from [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]], the government substantially backed-down from its intentions. The Heath government (1970\u20131974) introduced the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]] with many of the same ideas, but this was largely repealed by the post-1974 Labour government. Some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted (in modified form) during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\n====Record on income distribution====\nDespite the economic difficulties faced by the first Wilson government, it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office. Unemployment was kept below 2.7%, and inflation for much of the 1960s remained below 4%. Living standards generally improved, while public spending on housing, social security, transport, research, education and health went up by an average of more than 6% between 1964 and 1970.<ref name=\"white heat\">''White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties'', Dominic Sandbrook.</ref> The average household grew steadily richer, with the number of cars in the United Kingdom rising from one to every 6.4 persons to one for every five persons in 1968, representing a net increase of three million cars on the road. The rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969, as demonstrated by television sets (from 88% to 90%), refrigerators (from 39% to 59%), and washing machines (from 54% to 64%).<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nBy 1970, income in Britain was more equally distributed than in 1964, mainly because of increases in cash benefits, including family allowances.<ref>''The Struggle for Labour's Soul: Understanding Labour's political thought since 1945'' by Raymond Plant, Matt Beech and Kevin Hickson.</ref>\n\nAccording to one historian:{{who|date=November 2018}}\n\n{{quote|In its commitment to social services and public welfare, the Wilson government put together a record unmatched by any subsequent administration, and the mid-sixties are justifiably seen as the 'golden age' of the welfare state.<ref name=\"white heat\"/>}}\n\nAs noted by [[Ben Pimlott]], the gap between those on lowest incomes and the rest of the population \"had been significantly reduced\" under Wilson's first government.<ref>''Harold Wilson'' by Ben Pimlott.</ref> The first Wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal,<ref name=\"socialists1\"/> while reductions in poverty took place.<ref>''Poverty in Britain, 1900\u20131965'' by Ian Gazeley.</ref> These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits,<ref>''Understanding Social Policy'' by Michael James Hill.</ref> such as supplementary benefit, pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968). A new system of rate rebates was introduced, which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Increases in national insurance benefits in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependant on state benefits saw their [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable incomes]] rise faster than manual wage earners, while income differentials between lower income and higher income workers were marginally narrowed. Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter.<ref name=\"whiting\">''The Labour Party and Taxation: Party Identity and Political Purpose in Twentieth-Century Britain'' by Richard Whiting.</ref> Also, in spite of an increase in unemployment, the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced.<ref name=\"labour1945\"/> Despite various cutbacks after 1966, expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964. In addition, by raising taxes to pay their reforms, the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution, with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in office.<ref>''The Labour Party Since 1945'' by Kevin Jeffreys.</ref>\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, benefits in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in the lower half of the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half. On average those receiving state benefits benefited more in terms of increases in real disposable income than the average manual worker or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969.<ref name=\"beckerman\"/> From 1964 to 1969, low-wage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population. In 1969, a married couple with two children were 11.5% per cent richer in real terms, while for a couple with three children, the corresponding increase was 14.5%, and for a family with four children, 16.5%.<ref name=\"hansard.millbanksystems.com\">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/27/clause-14 Clause 14, ALTERATIONS OF PERSONAL RELIEFS (Hansard, 27 May 1970)] -Hansard.millbanksystems.com. Retrieved 13 February 2012.</ref> From 1965 to 1968, the income of single pensioner households as a percentage of other one adult households rose from 48.9% to 52.5%. For two pensioner households, the equivalent increase was from 46.8% to 48.2%.<ref name=\"inequality\"/> In addition, mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits, unemployed persons and large families gained more in terms of real disposable income than the rest of the population during Wilson's time in office.<ref name=\"socialists1\"/>\n\nAs noted by Paul Whiteley, pensions, sickness, unemployment, and supplementary benefits went up more in real terms under the First Wilson Government than under the preceding Conservative administration:\n\n\"To compare the Conservative period of office with the Labour period, we can use the changes in benefits per year as a rough estimate of comparative performance. For the Conservatives and Labour respectively increases in supplementary benefits per year were 3.5 and 5.2 percentage points, for sickness and unemployment benefits 5.8 and 30.6 percentage points, for pensions 3.8 and 4.6, and for family allowances \u22121.2 and \u22122.6. Thus the poor, the retired, the sick and the unemployed did better in real terms under Labour than they did under Conservatives, and families did worse.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, cash benefits rose as a percentage of income for all households but more so for poorer than for wealthier households. As noted by the economist Michael Stewart,\n\n\"it seems indisputable that the high priority the Labour Government gave to expenditure on education and the health service had a favourable effect on income distribution.\"<ref name=\"beckerman\"/>\n\nFor a family with two children in the income range \u00a3676 to \u00a3816 per annum, cash benefits rose from 4% of income in 1964 to 22% in 1968, compared with a change from 1% to 2% for a similar family in the income range \u00a32,122 to \u00a32,566 over the same period. For benefits in kind the changes over the same period for similar families were from 21% to 29% for lower income families and from 9% to 10% for higher income families. When taking into account all benefits, taxes and Government expenditures on social services, the first Wilson government succeeded in bringing about a reduction in income inequality. As noted by the historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]],\n\n\"In the long term, therefore, fortified by increases in supplementary and other benefits under the Crossman regime in 1968\u201370, the welfare state had made some impact, almost by inadvertence, on social inequality and the maldistribution of real income\".<ref>''Labour in Power, 1945\u20131951'' by Kenneth O. Morgan.</ref>\n\nPublic expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose significantly under the 1964\u20131970 Labour government, from 34% in 1964\u201365 to nearly 38% of GDP by 1969\u201370, whilst expenditure on social services rose from 16% of national income in 1964 to 23% by 1970.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> These measures had a major impact on the living standards of low-income Britons, with disposable incomes rising faster for low-income groups than for high-income groups during the course of the 1960s. When measuring disposable income after taxation but including benefits, the total disposable income of those on the highest incomes fell by 33%, whilst the total disposable income of those on the lowest incomes rose by 104%.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> As noted by one historian, \"the net effect of Labour's financial policies was indeed to make the rich poorer and the poor richer\".<ref>''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Movement from the 1880s to the 1990s'' by A.

An entry attempt was vetoed in 1963 by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The Labour Party in Opposition had been divided on the issue, with Hugh Gaitskell having come out in 1962 in opposition to Britain joining the Community.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: \"Hugh Gaitskell\".</ref> After initial hesitation, Wilson's Government in May 1967 lodged the UK's second application to join the European Community. It was vetoed by de Gaulle in November 1967.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Gowland|title=Britain and European Integration Since 1945: On the Sidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvt-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|page=69|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781134354528}}</ref> After De Gaulle lost power, Conservative prime minister Edward Heath negotiated Britain's admission to the EC in 1973.\n\nWilson in opposition showed political ingenuity in devising a position that both sides of the party could agree on, opposing the terms negotiated by Heath but not membership in principle. Labour's 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then [[Referendum Act 1975|hold a referendum]] on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history.\n\nFollowing Wilson's return to power, the renegotiations with Britain's fellow EC members were carried out by Wilson himself in tandem with Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]], and they toured the capital cities of Europe meeting their European counterparts. The discussions focused primarily on Britain's net [[Public finance|budgetary]] contribution to the EC. As a small agricultural producer heavily dependent on imports, Britain suffered doubly from the dominance of:\n\n:(i) agricultural spending in the EC [[Government budget|budget]],\n:(ii) agricultural [[import tax]]es as a source of EC [[revenue]]s.\n\nDuring the renegotiations, other EEC members conceded, as a partial offset, the establishment of a significant [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF), from which it was clearly agreed that Britain would be a major net beneficiary.<ref>Andrew Moravcsik, \"The Choice for Europe\" (Cornell, 1998).</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government were free to present their views on either side of the question. The electorate [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|voted on 5 June 1975]] to continue membership, by a substantial majority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm 1975: UK embraces Europe in referendum] BBC On This Day.</ref>\n\n====Asia====\nAmerican military involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] escalated continuously from 1964 to 1968 and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] brought pressure to bear for at least a token involvement of British military units. Wilson consistently avoided any commitment of British forces, giving as reasons British military commitments to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and British co-chairmanship of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]].<ref>Rhiannon Vickers, \"Harold Wilson, the British Labour Party, and the War in Vietnam.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 10#2 (2008): 41\u201370.

On at least one occasion the British government made an unsuccessful effort to mediate in the conflict, with Wilson discussing peace proposals with [[Alexei Kosygin]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR Council of Ministers]]. On 28 June 1966 Wilson 'dissociated' his Government from American bombing of the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. In his memoirs, Wilson writes of \"selling LBJ a [[A bum steer|bum steer]]\", a reference to Johnson's Texas roots, which conjured up images of cattle and cowboys in British minds.<ref name=\"Government1\"/>\n\nPart of the price paid by Wilson after talks with President Johnson in June 1967 for US assistance with the UK economy was his agreement to maintain a military presence [[East of Suez]].<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994), p. 359.</ref> In July 1967 [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Denis Healey]] announced that Britain would abandon her mainland bases East of Suez by 1977, although airmobile forces would be retained which could if necessary be deployed in the region.

[[Southern Rhodesia]] was not granted independence, principally because Wilson refused to grant independence to the white minority government headed by Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] which was not willing to extend unqualified voting rights to the native African population. Smith's defiant response was a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], on 11 November 1965. Wilson's immediate recourse was to the United Nations, and in 1965, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] imposed sanctions, which were to last until official independence in 1979. This involved [[Beira Patrol|British warships blockading the port of Beira]] to try to cause economic collapse in Rhodesia. Wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue (and none extended diplomatic recognition to the Smith r\u00e9gime). A number of nations did not join in with sanctions, undermining their efficiency. Certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy, and to demand the toppling of the r\u00e9gime by force. Wilson declined to intervene in Rhodesia with military force, believing the British population would not support such action against their \"kith and kin\". The two leaders met for discussions aboard British warships, {{HMS|Tiger|C20|2}} in 1966 and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} in 1968. Smith subsequently attacked Wilson in his memoirs, accusing him of delaying tactics during negotiations and alleging duplicity; Wilson responded in kind, questioning Smith's good faith and suggesting that Smith had moved the goal-posts whenever a settlement appeared in sight.<ref name=\"Government1\">Harold Wilson, \"The Labour Government, 1964\u201370: a Personal Record\".</ref> The matter was still unresolved at the time of Wilson's resignation in 1976.\n\n==Defeat and return to opposition, 1970\u20131974==\n{{see also|Second Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson}}\nBy 1969, the Labour Party was suffering serious electoral reverses, and by the turn of 1970 had lost a total of 16 seats in by-elections since the previous general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge70.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=BBC |date=18 June 1970 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1970, the economy was showing signs of improvement, and by May that year, Labour had overtaken the Conservatives in the opinion polls.<ref>''Twentieth-century Britain: a political history'' by W.

It partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in the first budget from new chancellor [[Denis Healey]], which came into law in April 1974. Also implemented was an investment income surcharge which raised the top rate on investment income to 98%, the highest level since the Second World War.\n\nDespite its achievements in social policy, Wilson's government came under scrutiny in 1975 for the rise in the unemployment rate, with the total number of Britons out of work passing one million by that April.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1975.html |title=Those were the days |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nWilson's second government came into office at a troubled time for the British economy, due to [[1973\u20131975 recession|a global recession]] and high [[inflation]], in large part this was due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], and also the preceding government's inflationary attempts to boost growth.<ref name=\"Britrec\">{{cite web |title=British recessions: a short history |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/britain-recessions-history |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> In order to deal with inflation (which peaked at 26% in 1975) the government negotiated a '[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]' with the [[Trades Union Congress]] to implement a voluntary [[incomes policy]], in which pay rises were held down to limits set by the government. This policy operated with reasonable success for the next few years, and brought inflation down to single figures by 1978.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> By 1976 the recession had ended and economic recovery began,<ref name=\"Britrec\"/> by 1978/79 living standards recovered to the level they had been in 1973/74.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974\u201379 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref> The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect the living standards of many people from the worst effects of the recession and high inflation, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent and [[Prices Commission (UK)|price controls]] and food and transport subsidies mitigated the adverse impact on the living standards of many more people.<ref>The Labour Party: An introduction to its history, structure and politics edited by Chris Cook and Ian Taylor</ref>\n\nThe government's [[industrial policy]] was greatly influenced by the economist [[Stuart Holland]] and the [[Secretary of State for Industry]] [[Tony Benn]]. The centrepiece of the policy was the [[National Enterprise Board]] (NEB) which was established in 1975, and was intended to channel public investment into industry, in return for taking a holding of equity in private companies. The NEB was intended to extend [[public ownership]] of the economy as well as investing in the regeneration of industry, although it had some successes in that aim, in practice one of its main activities became that of propping up failing companies such as [[British Leyland]]. The government also continued its policy of encouraging regional development by increasing Regional Employment Premiums, which had first been established in 1967.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=National Enterprise Board (NEB) |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-enterprise-board-neb.htm |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nWilson's earlier government had witnessed the outbreak of [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. In response to a request from the [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921\u20131972)|Government of Northern Ireland]], Wilson agreed to [[Operation Banner|deploy the British Army]] in August 1969 in an effort to restore the peace.\n\nWhile out of office in late 1971, Wilson had formulated a 16-point, 15-year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of Ireland. The proposal was not adopted by the then Heath government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/72may/donoghue.htm |title=May 1972 &#124; Ireland: The View from Dublin |last=Donoghue|first= Denis |work=The Atlantic |date=31 October 2001 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |quote=Edward Heath thanked him without adopting his suggestions.}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1974, when back in office as leader of a minority government, Wilson condemned the [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]-controlled [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] as a \"[[sectarian]] strike\", which was \"being done for sectarian purposes having no relation to this century but only to the seventeenth century\". He refused to pressure a reluctant [[British Army]] to face down the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers. In a televised speech later, he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as \"spongers\" who expected Britain to pay for their lifestyles. The strike was eventually successful in breaking the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland]] executive.\n\nOn 11 September 2008, BBC Radio Four's ''Document'' programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plan\u2014codenamed ''Doomsday''\u2014which proposed to cut all of the United Kingdom's constitutional ties with Northern Ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion. ''Document'' went on to claim that the Doomsday plan was devised mainly by Wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret. The plan then allegedly lost momentum, due in part, it was claimed, to warnings made by both the then Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, and the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Garret FitzGerald]] who admitted the 12,000-strong Irish army would be unable to deal with the ensuing civil war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7610750.stm|title=Wilson had NI 'doomsday' plan|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 Wilson secretly offered Libya's dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]] \u00a314 million (\u00a3500 million in 2009 values) to stop arming the IRA, but Gaddafi demanded a far greater sum of money.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-offered-gaddafi-16314m-to-stop-supporting-the-ira-1797754.html \"Britain offered Gaddafi \u00a314m to stop supporting the IRA\"] \u2013 ''The Independent'' (London).

He claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s, he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later [[Lord Stone of Hendon]]), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as Prime Minister. Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary.<ref name=autogenerated1/> His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as [[colon cancer]], and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress.<ref name=\"guardian-19950525\"/> In addition, by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]], which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.<ref name=\"Morris 2008\">{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Nigel |title=Wilson 'may have had Alzheimer's when he resigned' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/wilson-may-have-had-alzheimers-when-he-resigned-1009829.html |accessdate=28 August 2019 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=11 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nWilson's [[1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Prime Minister's Resignation Honours]] included many businessmen and celebrities, along with his political supporters. His choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation, worsened by the suggestion that the first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]] on lavender notepaper (it became known as the \"[[Lavender list|Lavender List]]\"). [[Roy Jenkins]] noted that Wilson's retirement \"was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party.\"<ref>Roy Jenkins, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916\u20131995)'], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, May 2006, Retrieved 22 February 2008.</ref> Some of those whom Wilson honoured included [[Joseph Kagan, Baron Kagan|Lord Kagan]], the inventor of [[Gannex]] (Wilson's preferred raincoat), who was eventually imprisoned for fraud, and Sir [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]], who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption.\n\nThe Labour Party held an [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|election]] to replace Wilson as leader of the Party (and therefore Prime Minister). Six candidates stood in the first ballot; in order of votes they were: [[Michael Foot]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Tony Benn]], [[Denis Healey]] and [[Anthony Crosland]]. In the third ballot on 5 April, Callaghan defeated Foot in a parliamentary vote of 176 to 137, thus becoming Wilson's successor as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party, and he continued to serve as Prime Minister until May 1979, when Labour lost the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] to the Conservatives and [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nAs Wilson wished to remain an MP after leaving office, he was not immediately given the [[peerage]] customarily offered to retired Prime Ministers, but instead was created a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]. On leaving the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] after the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] he was granted a [[life peerage]] as '''Baron Wilson of Rievaulx''',<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49485 |date=21 September 1983 |page=12361}}</ref> after [[Rievaulx Abbey]], in the north of his native Yorkshire.\n\n==Retirement and death, 1976\u20131995==\n[[File:Harold Wilson 1 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wilson in 1986]]\nShortly after resigning as Prime Minister, Wilson was signed by [[David Frost]] to host a series of interview/chat show programmes. The pilot episode proved to be a flop as Wilson appeared uncomfortable with the informality of the format. Wilson also hosted two editions of the BBC chat show ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]''. He famously floundered in the role, and in 2000, Channel 4 chose one of his appearances as one of the 100 Moments of TV Hell.\n\nA lifelong [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] fan, in 1975, Wilson joined the Board of Trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte Trust]] at the invitation of Sir [[Hugh Wontner]], who was then the [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Wilson and Lloyd, p. 7.</ref> At Christmas 1978, Wilson appeared on the ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' Christmas Special.

Wilson appeared on the show again in 1980.\n\nWilson was not especially active in the House of Lords, although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in May 1984.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1984/may/09/unemployment Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 451 cols 923\u20131002.</ref> His last speech was in a debate on [[Maritime pilot|marine pilotage]] in 1986, when he commented as an elder brother of [[Trinity House]].<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1986/jun/25/marine-pilotage#S5LV0477P0_19860625_HOL_197 Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 477 cols 389-90.</ref> In the same year he played himself as Prime Minister in an [[Anglia Television]] drama, ''Inside Story''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0094486|Inside Story}}; see [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1986/02/12/AS120286004 ITNsource] for video.</ref>\n\n[[File:Harold Wilson's grave St Mary's, Old Town - geograph org uk - 934336 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Harold Wilson's grave]]\nHe continued regularly attending the House of Lords until just over a year before his death; the last sitting he attended was on 27 April 1994.<ref>''LJ'' [1994] 342.</ref> Wilson died from [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and Alzheimer's disease in May 1995, aged 79.

He largely retained his [[Yorkshire accent]]. Other features of this persona included his working man's [[Gannex]] raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him [[Pipe Smoker of the Year]] in 1965 and Pipeman of the Decade in 1976, though in private he preferred cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular British relish [[HP Sauce]], and his support for his home town's football team, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=340222&rel_no=1 \"A 2012 Chance for David Beckham?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020011047/http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=340222&rel_no=1 |date=20 October 2007 }}, OhMy News International Sports, 16 January 2007.</ref> His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise after \"thirteen years of Tory mis-rule\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Rowe|title=Britain 1929-1998|url=https://archive.org/details/britain192919980000rowe|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|page=[https://archive.org/details/britain192919980000rowe/page/82 82]}}</ref>\n\nWilson exhibited his populist touch in June 1965 when he had [[the Beatles]] honoured with the award of [[MBE]] (such awards are officially bestowed by the Queen but are nominated by the Prime Minister of the day). The award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the Prime Minister was \"in touch\" with the younger generation. There were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award, but such protesters were in the minority. Critics claimed that Wilson acted to solicit votes for the next general election (which took place less than a year later), but defenders noted that, since the minimum voting age at that time was 21, this was hardly likely to impact many of the Beatles' fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers.

Recent scholarship concludes that:\n{{quote|The characterisation of Harold Wilson as paranoid does not take account of the political context of the time, which was characterised by a paranoid political style generally which applied to both left and right (including MI5 itself). The suspicion of Wilson and others towards the unlawful activities of the security services and other right wing figures resulted from concrete domestic and international developments discussed in more detail below. Andrew is correct to be sceptical, and there remains limited evidence of a 'plot', if a plot is defined as a tightly organised high-level conspiracy with a detailed plan. However, there is evidence of a conspiracy: a loosely connected series of unlawful manoeuvres against an elected government by a group of like-minded figures.<ref>Jon Moran, \"Conspiracy and contemporary history: revisiting MI5 and the Wilson plot[s].\" ''Journal of Intelligence History'' (2014) 13#2, pp. 161\u2013175, quote at p. 162.</ref>}}\n\nThe Director General of the Security Service assured Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], and she told the House of Commons on 6 May 1987:\n{{quote|He has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations.

{{post-nominals|commas=on|country=GBR|size=small|KG|OBE|PC|FRS|FSS}} (11&nbsp;March 1916 \u2013 24 May 1995), was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976.\n\nEntering Parliament in 1945, Wilson was appointed a [[parliamentary secretary]] in the [[Attlee ministry]] and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks; he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] in 1947 and was elevated to Cabinet shortly thereafter as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. In opposition to the next Conservative government, he served as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor]] (1955&ndash;1961) and [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] (1961&ndash;1963). After Labour Party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] died suddenly in 1963, Wilson won the subsequent [[1963 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election]]. After narrowly winning the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], Wilson saw an increased majority in a snap [[1966 United Kingdom general election|election in 1966]].\n\nWilson's [[Labour government, 1964\u20131970|first period as Prime Minister]] coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity, though hindered by significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments. In 1969 he [[Operation Banner|sent British troops to Northern Ireland]]. After losing the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] to [[Edward Heath]], he spent four years as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] before the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until another [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election in October]], resulting in a narrow Labour victory. A period of economic crisis had begun to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister. Wilson's approach to [[socialism]] was moderate compared with others in his party at the time, emphasising programmes aimed at increasing opportunity in society through relatively indirect means rather than the more direct socialist goal of promoting wider [[public ownership]] of industry and workers' control of production. He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution's stated dedication to [[public ownership]] as a stepping stone towards this goal, though he did not formally disavow it. Himself a member of the party's [[soft left]], Wilson joked about leading a cabinet made up mostly of [[Social democracy|social democrats]], comparing himself to a [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary presiding over a [[Tsarist]] cabinet, but there was little to divide him ideologically from the social democratic cabinet majority.<ref>''The Labour government, 1974\u201379: political aims and economic reality'' by Martin Holmes.</ref><ref name=\"labour1945\">''The Labour Party since 1945'' by Eric Shaw.</ref>\n\nOverall, historians evaluate Wilson as having led his party through difficult political issues with considerable skill. Important issues of the time included the role of public ownership, membership of the [[European Economic Community]], and involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], in which he refused to allow the use of British combat troops, although he maintained an expensive military presence [[east of Suez]].<ref name=\"guardian-19950525\">{{cite news|first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries |title=Harold Wilson &#124; Politics |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 1 July 2005|accessdate=10 April 2014 |location=London}}</ref> His stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance, applying technology more democratically, and reducing inequality was largely unfulfilled. He seemed to some observers to lose his energy and drive in his second premiership and found it difficult to mediate disputes concerning European integration and trade union rights.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson'' (1992), pp. 604\u20135, 648, 656, 670\u201377, 689.</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nWilson was born at Warneford Road, [[Huddersfield]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 11 March 1916. He came from a political family: his father James Herbert Wilson (1882\u20131971) was a works chemist who had been active in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], going as far as to be [[Winston Churchill]]'s deputy election agent in his 1908 [[by-election]] before joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. His mother Ethel (''n\u00e9e'' Seddon; 1882\u20131957) was a schoolteacher before her marriage; in 1901 her brother [[Harold Seddon]] settled in [[Western Australia]] and became a local political leader. When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a much-reproduced photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of [[10 Downing Street]]. At the age of ten he went with his family to Australia, where he became fascinated with the pomp and glamour of politics. On the way home he told his mother, \"I am going to be Prime Minister.\"<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson'' (1992), pp. 3\u201320, quote p. 20.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nWilson won a scholarship to attend [[Royds Hall School|Royds Hall Grammar School]], his local [[grammar school]] (now a [[comprehensive school]]) in [[Huddersfield]] in Yorkshire. His father, working as an industrial chemist, was made redundant in December 1930, and it took him nearly two years to find work; he moved to [[Spital, Merseyside|Spital]] in Cheshire, on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in order to do so. Wilson was educated in the Sixth Form at the [[Wirral Grammar School for Boys]], where he became [[Head Boy]].\n\n[[File:Wilson banner.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Order of the Garter|Garter]] banner of Harold Wilson in the chapel at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]], Oxford, where he studied Modern History]]\nWilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]]; this, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study Modern History at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], from 1934. At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was strongly influenced by [[G. D. H. Cole]]. His politics tutor, [[R. B. McCallum]], considered Wilson as the best student he ever had.<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Labour People: Leaders and Lieutenants, Hardie to Kinnock'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 247.</ref> He graduated in PPE ([[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]) with \"an outstanding first class Bachelor of Arts degree, with alphas on every paper\" in the final examinations, and a series of major academic awards.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson,'' (1993), p. 59.</ref> Biographer [[Roy Jenkins]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Academically his results put him among prime ministers in the category of [[Robert Peel|Peel]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]], and no one else. But...he lacked originality. What he was superb at was the quick assimilation of knowledge, combined with an ability to keep it ordered in his mind and to present it lucidly in a form welcome to his examiners.<ref>Jenkins (2009).</ref></blockquote>\n  \nHe continued in academia, becoming one of the youngest Oxford dons of the century at the age of 21. He was a lecturer in [[Economic History]] at [[New College, Oxford|New College]] from 1937, and a research [[fellow]] at [[University College, Oxford|University College]].\n\n===Marriage===\nOn New Year's Day 1940, in the chapel of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], he married [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Baldwin]], who remained his wife until his death. Mary Wilson became a published poet. They had two sons, [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin]] and Giles (named after [[Giles Alington (academic)|Giles Alington]]); Robin became a professor of Mathematics, and Giles became a teacher and later a train driver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/son-of-former-pm-harold-wilson-swaps-teaching-for-a-career-as-train-driver-7210307.html|title=Son of former PM Harold Wilson swaps teaching for a career as train driver|work=[[The Evening Standard]]|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref> In their twenties, his sons were under a kidnap threat from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] because of his father's prominence.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/and-you-thought-your-family-politics-were-bad-what-s-it-like-to-be-the-child-of-a-politician-8572555.html\n| title = And you thought your family politics were bad... what's it like to be the child of a politician?| accessdate =29 November 2019\n| date = 19 September 2006\n| last = Usborne\n| first = Simon\n| work=The Independent |location=London\n}}</ref>\n\n===War service===\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilson volunteered for military service but was classed as a specialist and moved into the civil service instead. For much of this time, he was a research assistant to [[William Beveridge]], the Master of University College, working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle. Wilson later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry. He was Director of Economics and Statistics at the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]] in 1943\u201344, and received an [[OBE]] for his services.<ref>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|first=David |last=Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=236, 237|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref>\n\nHe was to remain passionately interested in statistics, becoming a Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Peter G. |title=Obituary: James Harold Wilson 1916\u201395. |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

He was instrumental as Prime Minister in appointing [[Claus Moser]] as head of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]], and was president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1972\u201373.\n\n==Member of Parliament (1945\u201364)==\nAs the war drew to an end, he searched for a seat to fight at the impending general election. He was selected for the constituency of [[Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Ormskirk]], then held by [[Stephen King-Hall]]. Wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called, and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the Civil Service. He served as [[Praelector]] in Economics at University College between his resignation and his election to the House of Commons. He also used this time to write ''A New Deal for Coal'', which used his wartime experience to argue for nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue.\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], Wilson won his seat in the Labour landslide. To his surprise, he was immediately appointed to the government by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Two years later, he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]], in which capacity he made several official trips to the [[Soviet Union]] to negotiate supply contracts.\n\nThe boundaries of his Ormskirk constituency was significantly altered before the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1950]]. He stood instead for the new seat of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] near Liverpool, and was narrowly elected; he served there for 33 years until 1983.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HwyCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=wilson+mp+for+ormskirk#v=onepage&q=wilson%20mp%20for%20ormskirk&f=false|title=The Routledge Companion to Britain in the Twentieth Century|isbn=9781134476954|last1=Clapson|first1=Mark|date=23 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Cabinet Minister, 1947\u201351===\nWilson was appointed [[President of the Board of Trade]] on 29 September 1947, becoming, at the age of 31, the youngest member of a British Cabinet in the 20th century. He took a lead in abolishing some wartime rationing, which he referred to as a \"bonfire of controls\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Roy Jenkins, 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916\u20131995)', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000, accessed 3 August 2008]</ref>\n\nIn mid-1949, with Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Stafford Cripps]] having gone to Switzerland in an attempt to recover his health, Wilson was one of a group of three young ministers, all of them former economics dons and wartime civil servants, convened to advise Prime Minister Attlee on financial matters. The others were [[Douglas Jay]] ([[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]]) and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] ([[Minister of Fuel and Power]]), both of whom soon grew to distrust him. Jay wrote of Wilson's role in the debates over whether or not to devalue sterling that \"he changed sides three times within eight days and finished up facing both ways\". Wilson was given the task during his Swiss holiday of taking a letter to Cripps informing him of the decision to devalue, to which Cripps had been opposed.<ref>Dell 1997, pp. 120, 122.</ref> Wilson had tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Although a successful minister, he was regarded as self-important. He was not seriously considered for the job of Chancellor when Cripps stepped down in October 1950\u2014it was given to Gaitskell\u2014possibly in part because of his dubious role during devaluation.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 137.</ref>\n\nWilson was becoming known in the Labour Party as a left-winger, and joined [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] in resigning from the government in April 1951 in protest at the introduction of [[National Health Service]] (NHS) medical charges to meet the financial demands imposed by the [[Korean War]]. At this time, Wilson was not yet regarded as a heavyweight politician: [[Hugh Dalton]] referred to him scornfully as \"Nye [Bevan]'s dog\".<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 233.</ref>\n\nAfter Labour lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 election]], he became the Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's political group. At the bitter Morecambe Conference in late 1952, Wilson was one of the Bevanites elected as constituency representatives to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), whilst senior right-wingers such as Dalton and [[Herbert Morrison]] were voted off.<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 275.</ref>\n\n===Shadow Cabinet, 1954\u201363===\nWilson had never made much secret that his support of the left-wing Aneurin Bevan was opportunistic. In early 1954, Bevan resigned from the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) over Labour's support for the setting-up of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO). Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by [[Richard Crossman]], but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.<ref>Campbell 1987, p. 289.</ref>\n\nWilson's course in intra-party matters in the 1950s and early 1960s left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left or the right in the Labour Party. Despite his earlier association with Bevan, in [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|1955]] he backed [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the right-wing candidate in internal Labour Party terms, against Bevan for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,563492,00.html |title=Harold Wilson: Leading Labour beyond pipe dreams |first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 May 1995 |accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> Gaitskell appointed him [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1955, and he proved to be very effective.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 211\u201312.</ref> One of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the Government's Finance Bill in 1955, and his speeches as Shadow Chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit.

Bevan had died in July 1960, so Wilson established himself as a leader of the Labour left by launching an opportunistic but unsuccessful [[1960 Labour Party leadership election|challenge to Gaitskell's leadership in November 1960]]. Wilson would later be moved to the position of [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] in 1961, before he challenged for the deputy leadership in 1962 but was defeated by [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]].\n\n===Opposition Leader, 1963\u201364===\nGaitskell died in January 1963, just as the Labour Party had begun to unite and appeared to have a very good chance of winning the next election, with the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan Government]] running into trouble.

He argued that \"the Britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or for outdated measures on either side of industry\".

Notable amongst these was the partial decriminialisation of male [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], reform of [[divorce]] laws, the abolition of theatre [[censorship]] and [[capital punishment]] (except for a small number of offences&nbsp;\u2014 notably [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]]) and various pieces of legislation addressing [[race relations]] and [[racial discrimination]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\">{{cite book |last1=Thorpe |first1=Andrew |title=A History of the British Labour Party |date=2001 |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=0-333-92908-X|pages=145\u2013165}}</ref>\n\nHis government also undertook the easing of [[means testing]] for non-contributory welfare benefits, the linking of pensions to earnings, and the provision of industrial-injury benefits. Wilson's government also made significant reforms to [[education in the United Kingdom|education]], most notably the expansion of [[comprehensive education]] and the creation of the [[Open University]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\n====Economic policies====\nWilson's government put faith in [[economic planning]] as a way to solve Britain's economic problems. The government's strategy involved setting up a [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] (DEA) which would draw up a National Plan which was intended to promote growth and investment. Wilson believed that scientific progress was the key to economic and social advancement, as such he famously referred to the \"white heat of technology\", in reference to the modernisation of British industry. This was to be achieved through a new [[Ministry of Technology]] (shortened to 'Mintech') which would co-ordinate research and development and support the swift adoption of new technology by industry, aided by government-funded infrastructure improvements.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\nIn practice however, events derailed much of the initial optimism. Upon coming to power, the government was informed that they had inherited an exceptionally large deficit of \u00a3800 million on Britain's external [[balance of trade]]. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election. Immediately the pound came under enormous pressure, and many economists advocated [[devaluation]] of the pound in response, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as \"the party of devaluation\", the government instead opted to deal with the problem by imposing a temporary surcharge on imports, and a series of deflationary measures designed to reduce demand and therefore the inflow of imports.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> In the latter half of 1967, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a rise in unemployment.<ref name=\"inequality\">{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Peter |editor-last=Bosanquet |editor-first=Nicholas |publisher=[[Fabian Society]] |title=Labour and inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays |isbn=978-0-7163-4004-1|year=1972 }}</ref> \n\nAfter a costly battle, market pressures forced the government to devalue the pound by 14% from $2.80 to $2.40 in November 1967.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast soon after in which he assured listeners that the \"pound in your pocket\" had not lost its value.<ref>{{cite news |title=1967: Wilson defends 'pound in your pocket' |date=19 November 1967 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/19/newsid_3208000/3208396.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures which ensured resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption, successfully restored the trade balance to surplus by 1969. In retrospect Wilson has been widely criticised for not devaluing earlier, however he believed there were strong arguments against it, including the fear that it would set off a round of competitive devaluations, and concern about the impact price rises following a devaluation would have on people on low incomes.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\nThe government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. The National Plan produced by the DEA in 1965 targeted an annual growth rate of 3.8%, however under the restrained circumstances the actual average rate of growth between 1964 and 1970 was a far more modest 2.2%. The DEA itself was wound up in 1969. The government's other main initiative Mintech did have some success at switching research and development spending from military to civilian purposes, and of achieving increases in industrial productivity, although persuading industry to adopt new technology proved more difficult than had been hoped.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth,<ref>An influential study at the time, [[Andrew Shonfield]]'s ''Modern Capitalism'' (OUP, 1965), provided intellectual backing for the belief that indicative planning largely underlay the superior growth performance of France and Germany compared to the UK.</ref> embodied in the DEA and Mintech, was at the time by no means confined to the Labour Party. Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the [[National Economic Development Council]] (known as \"Neddy\") and its regional counterparts (the \"little Neddies\").<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened and the number of \"little Neddies\" was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970. The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, a connexion not always publicly grasped, under [[Tony Benn]].<ref name=\"ReferenceN\">''The Labour Government 1964\u201370'' by Brian Lapping.</ref> \n\nThe continued relevance of industrial [[nationalisation]] (a centrepiece of the post-War Labour government's programme) had been a key point of contention in Labour's internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s. Wilson's predecessor as leader, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy head-on, with a proposal to expunge [[Clause Four]] (the public ownership clause) from the party's constitution, but had been forced to climb down. Wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach: No significant expansion of public ownership took place under Wilson's government, however he placated the party's left wing by renationalising the steel industry in 1967 (which had been denationalised by the Conservatives in the 1950s) creating the [[British Steel Corporation]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> \n\nOne innovation of the Wilson government was the creation in 1968 of the [[Girobank]], a publicly owned bank which operated via the [[Post Office]] network: As most working class people in the 1960s didn't have bank accounts, this was designed to serve their needs, as such it was billed as the \"people's bank\".<ref>{{cite web |title=THE NATIONAL GIRO |url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/ea8cf00b-5d7e-4c7c-b8fe-264110303bd1 |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> Girobank was a long term success, surviving until 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Girobank disappears in A&L brand makeover |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2857020/Girobank-disappears-in-AandL-brand-makeover.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=21 January 2020 |date=7 July 2003}}</ref> \n\nWilson's government presided over a rate of [[unemployment]] which was low by historic (and later) standards but did rise during his period in office. Between 1964-66 the average rate of unemployment was 1.6%, while between 1966-70 the average stood at 2.5%.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> He had entered power at a time when unemployment stood at around 400,000. It still stood at 371,000 by early 1966 after a steady fall during 1965, but by March 1967 it stood at 631,000. It fell again towards the end of the decade, standing at 582,000 by the time of the general election in June 1970.<ref>[http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml Socialist Studies \u2013 Capitalism In Crisis \u2013 Unemployment In The 1930's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028013514/http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml |date=28 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of the economic difficulties faced by Wilson's government, it was  able to achieve important advances in a number of domestic policy areas. As reflected by Harold Wilson in 1971:\n\n{{quote|It was a government which faced disappointment after disappointment and none greater than the economic restraints in our ability to carry through the social revolution to which we were committed at the speed we would have wished. Yet, despite those restraints and the need to transfer resources from domestic expenditure, private and public, to the needs of our export markets, we carried through an expansion in the social services, health, welfare and housing, unparalleled in our history.<ref>Harold Wilson, The Labour Government 1964\u20131970: A Personal Record</ref>}}\n\n====Social issues====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Social issues}}\nA number of liberalising social reforms were passed through parliament during Wilson's first period in government. These dealt with the death penalty, homosexual acts, abortion, censorship and the voting age. There were new restrictions on immigration. Wilson personally, coming culturally from a provincial non-conformist background, showed no particular enthusiasm for much of this agenda.<ref>''The Battle of Britain: The Home Front'', by George Goldsmith Carter.</ref>\n\n====Education====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Education}}\nEducation held special significance for a socialist of Wilson's generation, in view of its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, for the first time in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''The Decade of Disillusion: British Politics in the Sixties'', edited by David Mckie and Chris Cook.</ref> Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the [[Robbins Report]], a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.\n\nWilson promoted the concept of an [[Open University]], to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning. His political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Baroness Lee]], the widow of [[Aneurin Bevan]].<ref name=\"ponting\">''Breach of Promise \u2013 Labour in Power, 1964\u201370'' by Clive Ponting.</ref> By 1981, 45,000 students had received degrees through the Open University.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Money was also channelled into local-authority run colleges of education.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nWilson's record on secondary education is, by contrast, highly controversial. Pressure grew for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the \"[[eleven-plus exam|eleven-plus]]\", and replacement with [[Comprehensive school]]s which would serve the full range of children (see the article '[[grammar schools debate]]'). Comprehensive education became Labour Party policy. From 1966 to 1970, the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10% to over 30%.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Changing party policy in Britain: an introduction'' by Richard Kelly.</ref>\n\nLabour pressed local authorities to convert grammar schools into comprehensives. Conversion continued on a large scale during the subsequent Conservative [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, although the Secretary of State, [[Margaret Thatcher]], ended the compulsion of local governments to convert.\n\nA major controversy that arose during Wilson's first government was the decision that the government could not fulfil its long-held promise to raise the school leaving age to 16, because of the investment required in infrastructure, such as extra classrooms and teachers.\n\nOverall, public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of GNP from 4.8% in 1964 to 5.9% in 1968, and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967.<ref>''A Short History Of The Labour Party'' by Henry Pelling.</ref> The percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly, and the student population increased by over 10% each year. Pupil-teacher ratios were also steadily reduced. As a result of the first Wilson government's educational policies, opportunities for working-class children were improved, while overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964.<ref name=\"socialists1\">''Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity'' by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice.</ref> As summarised by Brian Lapping,\n\n\"The years 1964\u201370 were largely taken up with creating extra places in universities, polytechnics, technical colleges, colleges of education: preparing for the day when a new Act would make it the right of a student, on leaving school, to have a place in an institution of further education.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Wilson was created the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the newly created [[University of Bradford]], a position he held until 1985.\n\n====Housing====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Housing}}\nHousing was a major policy area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than in the last six years of the previous Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total,<ref name=\"shorthistory\">''A Short History of the Labour Party'' by Alastair J. Reid and Henry Pelling.</ref> while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3&nbsp;million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970,<ref name=\"ponting\"/> To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments).<ref>''Housing policy: an introduction'' by Paul N. Balchin and Maureen Rhoden.</ref> This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''Capitalism and public policy in the UK'' by Tom Burden and Mike Campbell.</ref> and enabling more people to become owner occupiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=166 |title=Speech Archive |publisher=British Political Speech |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market.<ref>''The Evolution of the British Welfare State'' by Derek Fraser.</ref>\n\nSignificant emphasis was also placed on town planning, with new conservation areas introduced and a new generation of new towns built, notably [[Milton Keynes]]. The New Towns Acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority (through its ministries) to designate any area of land as a site for a [[new town]].<ref name=\"byrne1\">''Social Services: Made Simple'' by Tony Byrne, BA, BSc(Econ.), and Colin F. Padfield, LLB, DPA(Lond).</ref>\n\n====Urban renewal====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Urban renewal}}\nA number of subsidies were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems).<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> The Housing Act 1969 provided local authorities with the duty of working out what to do about 'unsatisfactory areas'. Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which they would be able to buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme.<ref name=\"cook\">''The decade of disillusion: British politics in the '60s'' by David McKie and Chris Cook.</ref> In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational Priority Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived.

[[Prescription charges]] for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of [[National Assistance]] (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed [[Supplementary Benefit]]. The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''Labour's First Century'' by [[Duncan Tanner]], [[Pat Thane]] and Nick Tiratsoo.</ref>\n\nThe widow's earning rule was also abolished,<ref name=\"ponting\"/> while a range of new social benefits was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who were considered to be unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a \"long-term\" allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added \"for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4wxjQFu2zsMC&pg=PA471&dq=From+1966,+following+a+recommendation+of+the+McCorquodale#v=onepage&q=From%201966%2C%20following%20a%20recommendation%20of%20the%20McCorquodale&f=false|title=Social Security Law in Context|isbn=9780198763086|last1=Harris|first1=Neville S.|year=2000}}</ref> Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity,<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmsocsec/56/9112407.htm |title=House of Commons \u2013 Social Security \u2013 Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968.<ref name=\"cook\"/> From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Labour Party (Great Britain).

This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and a significant increase in a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951\u201364 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\nThe [[1966 Doctor's Charter]] introduced allowances for rent and ancillary staff, significantly increased the pay scales, and changed the structure of payments to reflect \"both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i.e. group practice.\" These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in the increased use of ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a growth in the number of health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/> The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds for surgery, rents, and rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs. In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPs (since these doctors, the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, \"merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality).<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nIn 1967, local authorities were empowered to provide free family planning advice and means-tested contraceptive devices.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/><ref>''General practice under the National Health Service 1948\u20131997'' by Irvine Loudon, John Horder, Charles Webster.</ref> In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled.<ref name=\"shorthistory\"/> The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 empowered local authorities to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body.

On a limited scale, reports by the National Board for Prices and Incomes encouraged incentive payments schemes to be development in local government and elsewhere.

A National Freight Corporation was also established to provide integrated rail freight and road services. Public expenditure on roads steadily increased and stricter safety precautions were introduced, such as the [[breathalyser]] test for drunken driving,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> under the 1967 Road Traffic Act.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/> The Transport Act gave a much needed financial boost to [[British Rail]], treating them like they were a company which had become bankrupt but could now, under new management, carry on debt-free. The act also established a national freight corporation and introduced government [[rail subsidies]] for passenger transport on the same basis as existing subsidies for roads to enable local authorities to improve public transport in their areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nThe road building programme was also expanded, with capital expenditure increased to 8% of GDP, \"the highest level achieved by any post-war government\".<ref name=\"labour1\">''Ten Years of New Labour'', edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee.</ref> Central government expenditure on roads went up from \u00a3125 million in 1963/64 to \u00a3225 million in 1967/68, while a number of road safety regulations were introduced, covering seat belts, lorry drivers' hours, car and lorry standards, and an experimental 70 mile per hour speed limit. In Scotland, spending on trunk roads went up from \u00a36.8 million in 1963/64 to \u00a315.5 million in 1966/67, while in Wales, spending on Welsh roads went up from \u00a321.2 million in 1963/64 to \u00a331.4 million in 1966/67.<ref name=\"Labour 1968\"/>\n\n====Regional development====\nEncouragement of regional development was given increased attention under the First Wilson Government, with the aim of narrowing economic disparities between the various regions. A policy was introduced in 1965 whereby any new government organisation should be established outside London and in 1967 the government decided to give preference to development areas. A few government departments were also moved out of London, with the [[Royal Mint]] moved to [[South Wales]], the Giro and Inland Revenue to [[Bootle]], and the Motor Tax Office to [[Swansea]].<ref name=\"beckerman\">''The Labour government's Economic record: 1964\u20131970'', edited by Wilfred Beckerman.</ref> A new Special Development Status was also introduced in 1967 to provide even higher levels of assistance.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> In 1966, five development areas (covering half the population in the UK) were established, while subsidies were provided for employers recruiting new employees in the Development Areas.<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/> A Highlands and Islands Development Board was also set up to \"re-invigorate\" the north of Scotland.<ref name=\"Labour 1968\"/>\n\nThe Industrial Development Act 1966 changed the name of Development Districts (parts of the country with higher levels of unemployment than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed for the first time at increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at \u00a31.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.<ref name=\"ponting\"/>\n\nRegional unemployment differentials were narrowed, and spending on regional infrastructure was significantly increased. Between 1965\u201366 and 1969\u201370, yearly expenditure on new construction (including power stations, roads, schools, hospitals and housing) rose by 41% in the United Kingdom as a whole. Subsidies were also provided for various industries (such as [[shipbuilding]] in [[Clydeside]]), which helped to prevent a number of job losses. It is estimated that, between 1964 and 1970, 45,000 government jobs were created outside London, 21,000 of which were located in the Development Areas.<ref name=\"beckerman\"/> The Local Employment Act, passed in March 1970, embodied the government's proposals for assistance to 54 \"intermediate\" employment exchange areas not classified as full \"development\" areas.<ref name=\"Britannica1971\">''Britannica Book of the Year 1971'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc., William Benton (Publisher).</ref>\n\nFunds allocated to regional assistance more than doubled, from \u00a340&nbsp;million in 1964/65 to \u00a382&nbsp;million in 1969/70, and from 1964 to 1970, the number of factories completed was 50% higher than from 1960 to 1964, which helped to reduce unemployment in development areas. In 1970, the unemployment rate in development areas was 1.67 times the national average, compared to 2.21 times in 1964. Although national rates of unemployment were higher in 1970 than in the early 1960s, unemployment rates in the development areas were lower and had not increased for three years.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Altogether, the impact of the first Wilson government's regional development policies was such that, according to one historian, the period 1963 to 1970 represented \"the most prolonged, most intensive, and most successful attack ever launched on regional problems in Britain.\"<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\n====International development====\nA new Ministry of Overseas Development was established, with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interest-free loans for the poorest countries.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> The Minister of Overseas Development, [[Barbara Castle]], set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries, \"a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones.\" Loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time. In addition, Castle was instrumental in setting up an Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex to devise ways of tackling global socio-economic inequalities. Overseas aid suffered from the austerity measures introduced by the first Wilson government in its last few years in office, with British aid as a percentage of GNP falling from 0.53% in 1964 to 0.39% in 1969.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\n====Taxation====\nWilson's government made a variety of changes to the tax system. Largely under the influence of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born economists [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[Thomas Balogh]], an idiosyncratic [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. (The rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential.) The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer-term significance, [[capital gains tax]] (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.co.uk/Changes-To-Capital-Gains-Tax.htm |title=Warr & Co Chartered Accountants \u2013 Article \u2013 Changes To Capital Gains Tax |publisher=Warr.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531082945/http://www.warr.co.uk/Changes-To-Capital-Gains-Tax.htm |archivedate=31 May 2009  }}</ref> Across his two periods in office, Wilson presided over significant increases in the overall tax burden in the UK. In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor [[Denis Healey]] partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1974|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'unearned' income (investments and dividends) could add up to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top rate of income tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn25.pdf |title=IFS: Long-Term trends in British Taxation and Spending |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> \n\nVarious changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly.<ref name=\"inequality\"/> In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZvhMJWK930C&pg=PA129&dq=harold+wilson+widows+tax+concessions+1967#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20widows%20tax%20concessions%201967&f=false|title=Sinners?

Apart from the age relief, further adjustments in these concessions were implemented in 1970.<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\n1968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents. According to Michael Meacher, this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families, in otherwise identical circumstances, paid differing amounts of tax \"simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent, while in the other case the grandparent's identical property was inherited by the parent.\"<ref name=\"inequality\"/>\n\nIn the 1969 budget, income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowest paid and reduced for a further 600,000 people,<ref name=\"Crossman\"/> while in the government's last budget (introduced in 1970), two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether.<ref>\"Le contrat dans les pays anglo-saxons: th\u00e9ories et pratiques\" by Jean-Louis Breteau.</ref>\n\n====Liberal reforms====\n{{Main|Labour government, 1964\u20131970#Liberal reforms}}\nA wide range of liberal measures were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The [[Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970]] made provision for the welfare of children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent.<ref name=\"byrne1\"/> This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage.<ref name=\"Longman\"/> That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act.

Partly as a result of this reliance, the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes, with late-night \"beer and sandwiches at Number Ten\" an almost routine culmination to such episodes. Among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during Wilson's periods in office was a six-week stoppage by the [[National Union of Seamen]], beginning shortly after Wilson's [[1966 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1966]], and conducted, he claimed, by \"politically motivated men\".\n\nWith public frustration over strikes mounting, Wilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law), which were outlined in a White Paper \"[[In Place of Strife]]\" put forward by the Employment Secretary [[Barbara Castle]]. Following a confrontation with the [[Trades Union Congress]], which strongly opposed the proposals, and internal dissent from [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]], the government substantially backed-down from its intentions. The Heath government (1970\u20131974) introduced the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]] with many of the same ideas, but this was largely repealed by the post-1974 Labour government. Some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted (in modified form) during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name=\"Thorpe64702001\"/>\n\n====Record on income distribution====\nDespite the economic difficulties faced by the first Wilson government, it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office. Unemployment was kept below 2.7%, and inflation for much of the 1960s remained below 4%. Living standards generally improved, while public spending on housing, social security, transport, research, education and health went up by an average of more than 6% between 1964 and 1970.<ref name=\"white heat\">''White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties'', Dominic Sandbrook.</ref> The average household grew steadily richer, with the number of cars in the United Kingdom rising from one to every 6.4 persons to one for every five persons in 1968, representing a net increase of three million cars on the road. The rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969, as demonstrated by television sets (from 88% to 90%), refrigerators (from 39% to 59%), and washing machines (from 54% to 64%).<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\nBy 1970, income in Britain was more equally distributed than in 1964, mainly because of increases in cash benefits, including family allowances.<ref>''The Struggle for Labour's Soul: Understanding Labour's political thought since 1945'' by Raymond Plant, Matt Beech and Kevin Hickson.</ref>\n\nAccording to one historian:{{who|date=November 2018}}\n\n{{quote|In its commitment to social services and public welfare, the Wilson government put together a record unmatched by any subsequent administration, and the mid-sixties are justifiably seen as the 'golden age' of the welfare state.<ref name=\"white heat\"/>}}\n\nAs noted by [[Ben Pimlott]], the gap between those on lowest incomes and the rest of the population \"had been significantly reduced\" under Wilson's first government.<ref>''Harold Wilson'' by Ben Pimlott.</ref> The first Wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal,<ref name=\"socialists1\"/> while reductions in poverty took place.<ref>''Poverty in Britain, 1900\u20131965'' by Ian Gazeley.</ref> These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits,<ref>''Understanding Social Policy'' by Michael James Hill.</ref> such as supplementary benefit, pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968). A new system of rate rebates was introduced, which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> Increases in national insurance benefits in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependant on state benefits saw their [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable incomes]] rise faster than manual wage earners, while income differentials between lower income and higher income workers were marginally narrowed. Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter.<ref name=\"whiting\">''The Labour Party and Taxation: Party Identity and Political Purpose in Twentieth-Century Britain'' by Richard Whiting.</ref> Also, in spite of an increase in unemployment, the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced.<ref name=\"labour1945\"/> Despite various cutbacks after 1966, expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964. In addition, by raising taxes to pay their reforms, the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution, with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in office.<ref>''The Labour Party Since 1945'' by Kevin Jeffreys.</ref>\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, benefits in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in the lower half of the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half. On average those receiving state benefits benefited more in terms of increases in real disposable income than the average manual worker or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969.<ref name=\"beckerman\"/> From 1964 to 1969, low-wage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population. In 1969, a married couple with two children were 11.5% per cent richer in real terms, while for a couple with three children, the corresponding increase was 14.5%, and for a family with four children, 16.5%.<ref name=\"hansard.millbanksystems.com\">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/27/clause-14 Clause 14, ALTERATIONS OF PERSONAL RELIEFS (Hansard, 27 May 1970)] -Hansard.millbanksystems.com.

For two pensioner households, the equivalent increase was from 46.8% to 48.2%.<ref name=\"inequality\"/> In addition, mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits, unemployed persons and large families gained more in terms of real disposable income than the rest of the population during Wilson's time in office.<ref name=\"socialists1\"/>\n\nAs noted by Paul Whiteley, pensions, sickness, unemployment, and supplementary benefits went up more in real terms under the First Wilson Government than under the preceding Conservative administration:\n\n\"To compare the Conservative period of office with the Labour period, we can use the changes in benefits per year as a rough estimate of comparative performance. For the Conservatives and Labour respectively increases in supplementary benefits per year were 3.5 and 5.2 percentage points, for sickness and unemployment benefits 5.8 and 30.6 percentage points, for pensions 3.8 and 4.6, and for family allowances \u22121.2 and \u22122.6. Thus the poor, the retired, the sick and the unemployed did better in real terms under Labour than they did under Conservatives, and families did worse.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, cash benefits rose as a percentage of income for all households but more so for poorer than for wealthier households. As noted by the economist Michael Stewart,\n\n\"it seems indisputable that the high priority the Labour Government gave to expenditure on education and the health service had a favourable effect on income distribution.\"<ref name=\"beckerman\"/>\n\nFor a family with two children in the income range \u00a3676 to \u00a3816 per annum, cash benefits rose from 4% of income in 1964 to 22% in 1968, compared with a change from 1% to 2% for a similar family in the income range \u00a32,122 to \u00a32,566 over the same period. For benefits in kind the changes over the same period for similar families were from 21% to 29% for lower income families and from 9% to 10% for higher income families. When taking into account all benefits, taxes and Government expenditures on social services, the first Wilson government succeeded in bringing about a reduction in income inequality. As noted by the historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]],\n\n\"In the long term, therefore, fortified by increases in supplementary and other benefits under the Crossman regime in 1968\u201370, the welfare state had made some impact, almost by inadvertence, on social inequality and the maldistribution of real income\".<ref>''Labour in Power, 1945\u20131951'' by Kenneth O. Morgan.</ref>\n\nPublic expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose significantly under the 1964\u20131970 Labour government, from 34% in 1964\u201365 to nearly 38% of GDP by 1969\u201370, whilst expenditure on social services rose from 16% of national income in 1964 to 23% by 1970.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> These measures had a major impact on the living standards of low-income Britons, with disposable incomes rising faster for low-income groups than for high-income groups during the course of the 1960s. When measuring disposable income after taxation but including benefits, the total disposable income of those on the highest incomes fell by 33%, whilst the total disposable income of those on the lowest incomes rose by 104%.<ref name=\"ponting\"/> As noted by one historian, \"the net effect of Labour's financial policies was indeed to make the rich poorer and the poor richer\".<ref>''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Movement from the 1880s to the 1990s'' by A.

An entry attempt was vetoed in 1963 by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The Labour Party in Opposition had been divided on the issue, with Hugh Gaitskell having come out in 1962 in opposition to Britain joining the Community.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: \"Hugh Gaitskell\".</ref> After initial hesitation, Wilson's Government in May 1967 lodged the UK's second application to join the European Community. It was vetoed by de Gaulle in November 1967.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Gowland|title=Britain and European Integration Since 1945: On the Sidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvt-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|page=69|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781134354528}}</ref> After De Gaulle lost power, Conservative prime minister Edward Heath negotiated Britain's admission to the EC in 1973.\n\nWilson in opposition showed political ingenuity in devising a position that both sides of the party could agree on, opposing the terms negotiated by Heath but not membership in principle. Labour's 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then [[Referendum Act 1975|hold a referendum]] on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history.\n\nFollowing Wilson's return to power, the renegotiations with Britain's fellow EC members were carried out by Wilson himself in tandem with Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]], and they toured the capital cities of Europe meeting their European counterparts. The discussions focused primarily on Britain's net [[Public finance|budgetary]] contribution to the EC. As a small agricultural producer heavily dependent on imports, Britain suffered doubly from the dominance of:\n\n:(i) agricultural spending in the EC [[Government budget|budget]],\n:(ii) agricultural [[import tax]]es as a source of EC [[revenue]]s.\n\nDuring the renegotiations, other EEC members conceded, as a partial offset, the establishment of a significant [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF), from which it was clearly agreed that Britain would be a major net beneficiary.<ref>Andrew Moravcsik, \"The Choice for Europe\" (Cornell, 1998).</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government were free to present their views on either side of the question. The electorate [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|voted on 5 June 1975]] to continue membership, by a substantial majority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm 1975: UK embraces Europe in referendum] BBC On This Day.</ref>\n\n====Asia====\nAmerican military involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] escalated continuously from 1964 to 1968 and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] brought pressure to bear for at least a token involvement of British military units. Wilson consistently avoided any commitment of British forces, giving as reasons British military commitments to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and British co-chairmanship of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]].<ref>Rhiannon Vickers, \"Harold Wilson, the British Labour Party, and the War in Vietnam.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 10#2 (2008): 41\u201370.

On at least one occasion the British government made an unsuccessful effort to mediate in the conflict, with Wilson discussing peace proposals with [[Alexei Kosygin]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR Council of Ministers]]. On 28 June 1966 Wilson 'dissociated' his Government from American bombing of the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. In his memoirs, Wilson writes of \"selling LBJ a [[A bum steer|bum steer]]\", a reference to Johnson's Texas roots, which conjured up images of cattle and cowboys in British minds.<ref name=\"Government1\"/>\n\nPart of the price paid by Wilson after talks with President Johnson in June 1967 for US assistance with the UK economy was his agreement to maintain a military presence [[East of Suez]].<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994), p. 359.</ref> In July 1967 [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Denis Healey]] announced that Britain would abandon her mainland bases East of Suez by 1977, although airmobile forces would be retained which could if necessary be deployed in the region.

[[Southern Rhodesia]] was not granted independence, principally because Wilson refused to grant independence to the white minority government headed by Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] which was not willing to extend unqualified voting rights to the native African population. Smith's defiant response was a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], on 11 November 1965. Wilson's immediate recourse was to the United Nations, and in 1965, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] imposed sanctions, which were to last until official independence in 1979. This involved [[Beira Patrol|British warships blockading the port of Beira]] to try to cause economic collapse in Rhodesia. Wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue (and none extended diplomatic recognition to the Smith r\u00e9gime). A number of nations did not join in with sanctions, undermining their efficiency. Certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy, and to demand the toppling of the r\u00e9gime by force. Wilson declined to intervene in Rhodesia with military force, believing the British population would not support such action against their \"kith and kin\". The two leaders met for discussions aboard British warships, {{HMS|Tiger|C20|2}} in 1966 and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} in 1968. Smith subsequently attacked Wilson in his memoirs, accusing him of delaying tactics during negotiations and alleging duplicity; Wilson responded in kind, questioning Smith's good faith and suggesting that Smith had moved the goal-posts whenever a settlement appeared in sight.<ref name=\"Government1\">Harold Wilson, \"The Labour Government, 1964\u201370: a Personal Record\".</ref> The matter was still unresolved at the time of Wilson's resignation in 1976.\n\n==Defeat and return to opposition, 1970\u20131974==\n{{see also|Second Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson}}\nBy 1969, the Labour Party was suffering serious electoral reverses, and by the turn of 1970 had lost a total of 16 seats in by-elections since the previous general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge70.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=BBC |date=18 June 1970 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1970, the economy was showing signs of improvement, and by May that year, Labour had overtaken the Conservatives in the opinion polls.<ref>''Twentieth-century Britain: a political history'' by W.

Also implemented was an investment income surcharge which raised the top rate on investment income to 98%, the highest level since the Second World War.\n\nDespite its achievements in social policy, Wilson's government came under scrutiny in 1975 for the rise in the unemployment rate, with the total number of Britons out of work passing one million by that April.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1975.html |title=Those were the days |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nWilson's second government came into office at a troubled time for the British economy, due to [[1973\u20131975 recession|a global recession]] and high [[inflation]], in large part this was due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], and also the preceding government's inflationary attempts to boost growth.<ref name=\"Britrec\">{{cite web |title=British recessions: a short history |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/britain-recessions-history |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> In order to deal with inflation (which peaked at 26% in 1975) the government negotiated a '[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]' with the [[Trades Union Congress]] to implement a voluntary [[incomes policy]], in which pay rises were held down to limits set by the government. This policy operated with reasonable success for the next few years, and brought inflation down to single figures by 1978.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> By 1976 the recession had ended and economic recovery began,<ref name=\"Britrec\"/> by 1978/79 living standards recovered to the level they had been in 1973/74.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974\u201379 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref> The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect the living standards of many people from the worst effects of the recession and high inflation, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent and [[Prices Commission (UK)|price controls]] and food and transport subsidies mitigated the adverse impact on the living standards of many more people.<ref>The Labour Party: An introduction to its history, structure and politics edited by Chris Cook and Ian Taylor</ref>\n\nThe government's [[industrial policy]] was greatly influenced by the economist [[Stuart Holland]] and the [[Secretary of State for Industry]] [[Tony Benn]]. The centrepiece of the policy was the [[National Enterprise Board]] (NEB) which was established in 1975, and was intended to channel public investment into industry, in return for taking a holding of equity in private companies. The NEB was intended to extend [[public ownership]] of the economy as well as investing in the regeneration of industry, although it had some successes in that aim, in practice one of its main activities became that of propping up failing companies such as [[British Leyland]]. The government also continued its policy of encouraging regional development by increasing Regional Employment Premiums, which had first been established in 1967.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=National Enterprise Board (NEB) |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-enterprise-board-neb.htm |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nWilson's earlier government had witnessed the outbreak of [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. In response to a request from the [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921\u20131972)|Government of Northern Ireland]], Wilson agreed to [[Operation Banner|deploy the British Army]] in August 1969 in an effort to restore the peace.\n\nWhile out of office in late 1971, Wilson had formulated a 16-point, 15-year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of Ireland. The proposal was not adopted by the then Heath government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/72may/donoghue.htm |title=May 1972 &#124; Ireland: The View from Dublin |last=Donoghue|first= Denis |work=The Atlantic |date=31 October 2001 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |quote=Edward Heath thanked him without adopting his suggestions.}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1974, when back in office as leader of a minority government, Wilson condemned the [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]-controlled [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] as a \"[[sectarian]] strike\", which was \"being done for sectarian purposes having no relation to this century but only to the seventeenth century\". He refused to pressure a reluctant [[British Army]] to face down the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers. In a televised speech later, he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as \"spongers\" who expected Britain to pay for their lifestyles. The strike was eventually successful in breaking the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland]] executive.\n\nOn 11 September 2008, BBC Radio Four's ''Document'' programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plan\u2014codenamed ''Doomsday''\u2014which proposed to cut all of the United Kingdom's constitutional ties with Northern Ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion. ''Document'' went on to claim that the Doomsday plan was devised mainly by Wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret. The plan then allegedly lost momentum, due in part, it was claimed, to warnings made by both the then Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, and the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Garret FitzGerald]] who admitted the 12,000-strong Irish army would be unable to deal with the ensuing civil war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7610750.stm|title=Wilson had NI 'doomsday' plan|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 Wilson secretly offered Libya's dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]] \u00a314 million (\u00a3500 million in 2009 values) to stop arming the IRA, but Gaddafi demanded a far greater sum of money.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-offered-gaddafi-16314m-to-stop-supporting-the-ira-1797754.html \"Britain offered Gaddafi \u00a314m to stop supporting the IRA\"] \u2013 ''The Independent'' (London).

He claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s, he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later [[Lord Stone of Hendon]]), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as Prime Minister. Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary.<ref name=autogenerated1/> His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as [[colon cancer]], and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress.<ref name=\"guardian-19950525\"/> In addition, by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]], which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.<ref name=\"Morris 2008\">{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Nigel |title=Wilson 'may have had Alzheimer's when he resigned' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/wilson-may-have-had-alzheimers-when-he-resigned-1009829.html |accessdate=28 August 2019 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=11 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nWilson's [[1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Prime Minister's Resignation Honours]] included many businessmen and celebrities, along with his political supporters. His choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation, worsened by the suggestion that the first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]] on lavender notepaper (it became known as the \"[[Lavender list|Lavender List]]\"). [[Roy Jenkins]] noted that Wilson's retirement \"was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party.\"<ref>Roy Jenkins, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916\u20131995)'], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, May 2006, Retrieved 22 February 2008.</ref> Some of those whom Wilson honoured included [[Joseph Kagan, Baron Kagan|Lord Kagan]], the inventor of [[Gannex]] (Wilson's preferred raincoat), who was eventually imprisoned for fraud, and Sir [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]], who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption.\n\nThe Labour Party held an [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|election]] to replace Wilson as leader of the Party (and therefore Prime Minister). Six candidates stood in the first ballot; in order of votes they were: [[Michael Foot]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Tony Benn]], [[Denis Healey]] and [[Anthony Crosland]]. In the third ballot on 5 April, Callaghan defeated Foot in a parliamentary vote of 176 to 137, thus becoming Wilson's successor as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party, and he continued to serve as Prime Minister until May 1979, when Labour lost the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] to the Conservatives and [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nAs Wilson wished to remain an MP after leaving office, he was not immediately given the [[peerage]] customarily offered to retired Prime Ministers, but instead was created a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]. On leaving the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] after the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] he was granted a [[life peerage]] as '''Baron Wilson of Rievaulx''',<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49485 |date=21 September 1983 |page=12361}}</ref> after [[Rievaulx Abbey]], in the north of his native Yorkshire.\n\n==Retirement and death, 1976\u20131995==\n[[File:Harold Wilson 1 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wilson in 1986]]\nShortly after resigning as Prime Minister, Wilson was signed by [[David Frost]] to host a series of interview/chat show programmes. The pilot episode proved to be a flop as Wilson appeared uncomfortable with the informality of the format. Wilson also hosted two editions of the BBC chat show ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]''. He famously floundered in the role, and in 2000, Channel 4 chose one of his appearances as one of the 100 Moments of TV Hell.\n\nA lifelong [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] fan, in 1975, Wilson joined the Board of Trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte Trust]] at the invitation of Sir [[Hugh Wontner]], who was then the [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Wilson and Lloyd, p. 7.</ref> At Christmas 1978, Wilson appeared on the ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' Christmas Special. [[Eric Morecambe]]'s habit of appearing not to recognise the guest stars was repaid by Wilson, who referred to him throughout as 'Morry-camby' (the mis-pronunciation of Morecambe's name made by [[Ed Sullivan]] when the pair appeared on his famous American television show). Wilson appeared on the show again in 1980.\n\nWilson was not especially active in the House of Lords, although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in May 1984.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1984/may/09/unemployment Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 451 cols 923\u20131002.</ref> His last speech was in a debate on [[Maritime pilot|marine pilotage]] in 1986, when he commented as an elder brother of [[Trinity House]].<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1986/jun/25/marine-pilotage#S5LV0477P0_19860625_HOL_197 Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 477 cols 389-90.</ref> In the same year he played himself as Prime Minister in an [[Anglia Television]] drama, ''Inside Story''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0094486|Inside Story}}; see [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1986/02/12/AS120286004 ITNsource] for video.</ref>\n\n[[File:Harold Wilson's grave St Mary's, Old Town - geograph org uk - 934336 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Harold Wilson's grave]]\nHe continued regularly attending the House of Lords until just over a year before his death; the last sitting he attended was on 27 April 1994.<ref>''LJ'' [1994] 342.</ref> Wilson died from [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and Alzheimer's disease in May 1995, aged 79. His death came only months before that of his predecessor, [[Alec Douglas-Home]]. His memorial service was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 13 July 1995. It was attended by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], former Prime Ministers [[Edward Heath]], [[James Callaghan]], and [[Margaret Thatcher]], serving Prime Minister [[John Major]], and also a future Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], then Leader of the Opposition. Wilson was buried at [[St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's|St Mary's Old Church]], [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], on 6 June.

He largely retained his [[Yorkshire accent]]. Other features of this persona included his working man's [[Gannex]] raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him [[Pipe Smoker of the Year]] in 1965 and Pipeman of the Decade in 1976, though in private he preferred cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular British relish [[HP Sauce]], and his support for his home town's football team, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=340222&rel_no=1 \"A 2012 Chance for David Beckham?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020011047/http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=340222&rel_no=1 |date=20 October 2007 }}, OhMy News International Sports, 16 January 2007.</ref> His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise after \"thirteen years of Tory mis-rule\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Rowe|title=Britain 1929-1998|url=https://archive.org/details/britain192919980000rowe|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|page=[https://archive.org/details/britain192919980000rowe/page/82 82]}}</ref>\n\nWilson exhibited his populist touch in June 1965 when he had [[the Beatles]] honoured with the award of [[MBE]] (such awards are officially bestowed by the Queen but are nominated by the Prime Minister of the day). The award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the Prime Minister was \"in touch\" with the younger generation. There were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award, but such protesters were in the minority. Critics claimed that Wilson acted to solicit votes for the next general election (which took place less than a year later), but defenders noted that, since the minimum voting age at that time was 21, this was hardly likely to impact many of the Beatles' fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers. It cemented Wilson's image as a modernistic leader and linked him to the burgeoning pride in the 'New Britain' typified by the Beatles.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stuart Shea|author2=Robert Rodriguez|title=Fab Four FAQ: Everything Left to Know about the Beatles-- and More!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rGn7xU7zHEC&pg=PA73|year=2007|publisher=Hal Leonard|page=73|isbn=9781423421382}}</ref> The Beatles mentioned Wilson rather negatively, naming both him and his opponent [[Edward Heath]] in [[George Harrison]]'s song \"[[Taxman]]\", the opener to 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''\u2014recorded and released after the MBEs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Beatles|title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKG-FXj_HNYC&pg=PA69|year=1991|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=69|isbn=9780395594261}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Wilson had a different interaction with a musical ensemble.

The reinvention of the Labour Party would take the better part of two decades at the hands of [[Neil Kinnock]], [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] and electorally and most conclusively [[Tony Blair]]. Disillusionment with Britain's weak economic performance and troubled industrial relations, combined with active spadework by figures such as Sir [[Keith Joseph]], had helped to make a radical market programme politically feasible for Thatcher (which was in turn to influence the subsequent Labour leadership, especially under Blair).\n\nAn opinion poll in September 2011 found that Wilson came in third place when respondents were asked to name the best post-war Labour Party leader.
