I said, why don't we call it ''Charlie Brown'' and the president said \"Well, we can't copyright a name like that.\" I didn't ask them about ''[[Nancy (comic strip)|Nancy]]'' or ''[[Steve Canyon]]''. I was in no position to argue.\n |author = Charles Schulz\n |source = 1987 interview with Frank Pauer in ''Dayton Daily News and Journal Herald Magazine''{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}\n |align = right\n |width=30%\n}}\n''Peanuts'' had its origin in ''[[Li'l Folks]]'', a weekly panel cartoon that appeared in Schulz's hometown newspaper, the ''[[Twin Cities Pioneer Press|St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'', from 1947 to 1950. Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to ''Peanuts''. The name \"Charlie Brown\" was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.{{sfn|Bang|2004|p=5}}\n\nSchulz submitted his ''Li'l Folks'' cartoons to [[United Features Syndicate]] (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in [[New York City]] and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as ''Li'l Folk'', that is ''Li'l Folks'' without an 's', Tack Knight who authored the retired 1930s comic strip ''Little Folks'' sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of ''Little'' to ''Li'l'' was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that ''Little Folks'' was a registered trademark.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=218}} Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program ''[[Howdy Doody]]''. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the \"Peanut Gallery\", and were referred to as \"Peanuts\". This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=219}}\n\nThe title ''Peanuts'' was hated by Schulz and was a source of humiliation throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having even seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named \"Peanuts\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=56}} On the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried ''Peanuts'', to which the newsdealer replied, \"no, and we don't have any with popcorn either\"; this event confirmed his fears concerning the title.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=87}} Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say \"I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=221}} In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to ''Charlie Brown'' on multiple occasions in the past, but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=216}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s===\n<!-- FAIR USE of First Peanuts comic.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:First Peanuts comic.png for rationale -->\n[[File:First Peanuts comic.png|thumb|500px|The first strip from October 2, 1950.

Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4.<ref>{{Comic strip reference|cartoonist=[[Charles Schulz|Schulz, Charles]]|strip=Peanuts|date=October 4, 1950|syndicate=United Feature Syndicate}}</ref> Its first [[Sunday strip]] appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), \"Peppermint\" Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968) Woodstock (introduced April 1967; officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).\n\nSchulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of ''Peanuts''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nat Gertler |authorlink=Nat Gertler |title=Dale Hale and the 'Peanuts' Comic Book: The Interview | magazine=Hogan's Alley |issue=8 |date=October 2000 |publisher=Cartoonician.com}} Republished in ''[http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/ Hogan's Alley blog]'' by Tom Heintjes, May 17, 2015.</ref> Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"<ref name=\"Masters\">''Masters of American Comics'' John Carlin Yale University Press 2005</ref> Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: \"This is not a crazy business about slinging ink.

The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or [[Rugby union ball|rugby football]]. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. <!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s is generally considered to be the \"golden age\" for ''Peanuts''.<ref name=\":0\"/> During this period, some of the strip's best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, August 22, 1966 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Snoopy as the \"World War One Flying Ace\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 10, 1965 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/10/10|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Frieda and her \"naturally curly hair\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, March 06, 1961 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/03/06|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> and Franklin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, July 29, 1968 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/29|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> ''Peanuts'' is remarkable for its deft [[social commentary]], especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty's athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin's presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin's creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz's 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes>Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015).

In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2's launch of [[Laika]] the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned [[Little League]]s and \"organized\" play when all the neighborhood kids join [[snowman]]-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.<!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n''Peanuts'' touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' from 1965, features the character [[Linus van Pelt]] quoting the [[King James Version]] of the Bible (Luke 2:8\u201314) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', many have interpreted Schulz's work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/ |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=[[ImageTexT]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown's beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with Sally.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes/>\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nIn 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily ''Peanuts'' strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on [[Leap Day]] in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Later in the '90s, Schulz abandoned the characters Patty, Violet, Pig-Pen and Franklin.\n\nSchulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process.<ref>Yoe, Craig, ''Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings.''

The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that ran past January 3, he had drawn five Sunday strips that had yet to run. The first of these appeared six days after the last daily, on January 9.\n\nOn February 13, 2000, the day after Schulz's death, the last-ever new ''Peanuts'' strip ran in papers. Three panels long, it began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the other end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with \"No, I think he's writing.\" The next panel shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter addressed to \"Dear Friends\". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to fans, which reads as follows:\n\n''{{quote|Dear Friends,<br/>\n''I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years.

After ''Peanuts'' ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title ''Classic Peanuts''. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.\n\n''Peanuts'' continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of ''The Complete Peanuts'', the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]''. Additionally, [[BOOM! Studios]] has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\n\nUniversal Uclick's website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015 that they would be launching \"Peanuts Begins\", a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form.

He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip's world and serving as an [[everyman]].{{sfn|Boxer|2015}}{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Warner|2018}} While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an [[inferiority complex]]. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully build a kite.{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can either be interpreted as self-defeating stubbornness, or admirable persistence. When he fails however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity.{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} The journalist [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] observed this tension between Charlie Brown's negative and positive attitudes, stating: \"What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth[.]\"{{sfn|Caldwell 2000}} Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at [[Art Instruction Schools|Art Instruction]], whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=38}}\n\nReaders and critics have explored the question as to whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behaviour of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz's own life or childhood experiences.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=44}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview that \"I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I'm really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.\"{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=62}} He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz's \"wishy-washiness and determination\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=258}} Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=65}}\n\nSnoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a [[beagle]].{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=387}} While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=389}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=172}} He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through alter egos. Many are throwaway alter egos, such as a \"World-Famous\" magician, attorney, or surgeon.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}} His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while also being slightly selfish.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=391}} He has an arrogant committent to his independence, but is shown to be dependent on humans.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}} Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog, and that of a fantastical character.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=50}} While the inside of Snoopy's doghouse is described in the strip as being adorned with paintings of [[Andrew Wyeth|Wyeth]] and [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of [[suspension of disbelief|suspense of disbelief]] from readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Linus and Lucy===\n{{Main|Linus van Pelt|Lucy van Pelt}}\n\nLinus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother and Lucy is the older sister.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=70}}\n\nLucy is bossy and opinionated, and is used to deliver commentary on offence and honesty, as well as sarcasm.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=196}} Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but has the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=52}} He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=45}} Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and gives psychiatric advice to another character from her \"psychiatric booth\", a booth parodying the setup of a [[lemonade stand]].{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=89}} Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterised as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting \"Lucy is very much the modern doctor\".{{sfn|Yawar|2015}}\n\nLinus introduces intellectual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be \"very smart\" as well as \"dumb\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|pp=252\u2013253}} He has a tendency of expressing pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}} He finds psychological security from [[thumb sucking]] and holding a blanket for comfort, referred to as his \"security blanket\". The idea of his security blanket originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus' blanket as \"probably the single best thing that I ever thought of\". He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase \"security blanket\" entered the dictionary.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=91}}\n\n===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===\n{{Main|Peppermint Patty|Marcie}}\n\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends with each other. They attend a different school from Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}}\n\nPeppermint Patty is a [[tomboy]] who is forthright, loyal, and has what Schulz described as a \"devastating singleness of purpose\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that it serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepared for a skating competition, only to finally learn with disastrous results that it is for [[roller skating]] and not [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=94}} She struggles at school and with her homework, and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.{{sfn|J Schulz|2016}}\n\nMarcie is bookish, and a good student.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}} Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that \"she sees the truth in things\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as \"the unassuming one with sage-like insights\".{{sfn|Bradley|2015}}\n\n===Supporting characters===\n{{Main|List of Peanuts characters}}\n\nIn addition to the core cast, some other characters appeared regularly for a total of a majority of the strip's duration:\n* [[Sally Brown]] is the younger sister of Charlie Brown. She has a habit of fracturing the English language, to comical effect.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=175}} She reacts extremely negatively to school and homework, having to deal with dogmatic memorization and obeying ambiguous instructions.

''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' won a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy]]; ''Peanuts'' cartoon specials have received a total of two [[Peabody Award]]s and four [[Emmys]]. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (as does Snoopy) and a place in the [[William Randolph Hearst]] Cartoon Hall of Fame.

For example, in an essay published in the ''[[New York Press]]'' at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, \"Against Snoopy,\" [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] argued that Snoopy, and the strip's increased focus on him in the 1970s, \"went from being the strip's besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://nypress.com/against-snoopy/ |title=Against Snoopy |work=New York Press |first=Christopher |last=Caldwell |date=January 4, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nGiant [[helium]] balloons of Snoopy (seven versions), Charlie Brown (two versions), and Woodstock (two versions) have been featured in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City since 1968.

By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\"<ref>\"'Dear Sparky ...

This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. [[Ballantine Books]] published the last original series of ''Peanuts'' reprints, including ''Peanuts 2000'', which collected the final year of the strip's run.\n\nCoinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by [[Fawcett Publications]].

Hallmark began printing greetings cards and party goods featuring the characters in 1960.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} In the late 1960s, [[Sanrio]] held the licensing rights in Japan for Snoopy. Sanrio is best known for [[Hello Kitty]] and its focus on the [[kawaii]] segment of the Japanese market.{{sfn|Gomez|2004}} Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the [[MetLife]] insurance company, with the intention to make the business \"more friendly and approachable\".{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}} Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=254}} In 2016 the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended.{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}}\n\nIn 1999 it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, [[vacuum flask|Thermos bottle]]s, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television,{{sfn|Elliott|2000}} appearing on products such as [[Dolly Madison]] snack cakes, [[Chex Mix]] snacks, [[Bounty (brand)|Bounty]] paper towels, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] macaroni cheese and [[A&W Root Beer]].{{sfn|Bankston|2000}}\n\nThe sheer extent to which the characters have been used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pointed out that \"some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.\"{{sfn|Tawa|2000}} Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating \"our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive\" and \"we're not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products\" while also adding \"Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It's not that we're out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we're overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=103}}\n\n===Games===\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in various video games, such as ''[[Snoopy (video game)|Snoopy]]'' in 1984 by Radarsoft, ''Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game'' by The Edge, ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular]]'' (1989, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]), ''[[Snoopy's Magic Show]]'' (1990, [[Game Boy]]), ''[[Snoopy Tennis]]'' (2001, [[Game Boy Color]]), ''[[Snoopy Concert]]'' which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the [[Super NES]], and in October 2006, a second game titled ''[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (video game)|Snoopy vs. The Red Baron]]'' by [[Namco Bandai]] for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the ''[[Snoopy the Flying Ace]]'' mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, ''[[Snoopy's Town Tale]]'' was launched for mobile by [[Pixowl]], featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\n\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the [[Funk & Wagnalls]] publishing house also produced a children's encyclopedia called the ''Charlie Brown's 'Cyclopedia''. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\n\nIn April 2002, [[List of licensed and localized editions of Monopoly: USA#P|The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly]] board game was released by USAopoly. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.\n\n===Amusement parks===\n[[File:Snoopy_Bounce_at_Cedar_Point_Camp_Snoopy_entrance_(1572).jpg|thumb|right|Camp Snoopy, at Cedar Point]]\nIn 1983, [[Knott's Berry Farm]], in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the ''Peanuts'' characters, creating the first [[Camp Snoopy]] area and making Snoopy the park's mascot. Knott's expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the [[Mall of America]], called ''[[Nickelodeon Universe|Knott's Camp Snoopy]]''. The Knott's theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] in 1997, which continued to operate ''Knott's Camp Snoopy'' park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005.<ref>{{Citation |title=Mall of America strikes deal with Nickelodeon for theme park |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-03-06-mall-of-america-nickelodeon_N.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2007 | date=March 7, 2007 |work=USA Today}}</ref> Cedar Fair had already licensed the ''Peanuts'' characters for use in 1992 as an atmosphere,<ref>{{Citation |last=Munarriz |first=Rick Aristotle |title=Is Pixar Worth $7 Billion to Disney? |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2006/01/24/is-pixar-worth-7-billion-to-disney.aspx |accessdate=October 12, 2007}}</ref> so its acquisition of Knott's Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters.\n\nSnoopy is currently the official mascot of all the Cedar Fair parks. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], [[Worlds of Fun]], and [[Valleyfair]] featuring various ''Peanuts''-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at [[Cedar Point]] and Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nIn 2008, [[Cedar Point]] introduced [[Planet Snoopy]], a children's area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park [[Geauga Lake]] after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. The area also consists of a \"Kids Only\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe (there is a small menu for adults). In 2010, the [[Nickelodeon Central]] and [[Nickelodeon Universe]] areas in the former [[Paramount Parks]] ([[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island]]) were replaced by [[Planet Snoopy]]. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to [[Valleyfair]], [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], and [[Worlds of Fun]], replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. Planet Snoopy is now at every Cedar Fair park beside Knott's Berry Farm and [[Michigan's Adventure]]. In 2018 Planet Snoopy was renamed Camp Snoopy & renovations were made to make these areas of the Cedar Fair parks look more like a camp. Many of the rides were renamed as well.\n\nAlso, the ''Peanuts'' characters can be found at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Hello Kitty]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schulzmuseum.org/universal-studios-japan/ |title=Charles M.

And finally, an example from a strip on October 24, 1999 where Lucy tells Rerun Van Pelt to do the football gag for her, and it is unknown if he disobeyed her or not.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* Although the TV documentary \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" from 1963 never aired, the first peanuts music album, released in 1964 was titled \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and had the music from the documentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin|50em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bang|first=Derrick|title=Vince Guaraldi at the Piano|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5902-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Chip |last2=Spear |first2=Geoff |title=Only What's Necessary: Charles M.

[...] What could I do? Here I was, an unknown kid from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. I couldn't think of anything else. I said, why don't we call it ''Charlie Brown'' and the president said \"Well, we can't copyright a name like that.\" I didn't ask them about ''[[Nancy (comic strip)|Nancy]]'' or ''[[Steve Canyon]]''. I was in no position to argue.\n |author = Charles Schulz\n |source = 1987 interview with Frank Pauer in ''Dayton Daily News and Journal Herald Magazine''{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}\n |align = right\n |width=30%\n}}\n''Peanuts'' had its origin in ''[[Li'l Folks]]'', a weekly panel cartoon that appeared in Schulz's hometown newspaper, the ''[[Twin Cities Pioneer Press|St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'', from 1947 to 1950. Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to ''Peanuts''. The name \"Charlie Brown\" was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.{{sfn|Bang|2004|p=5}}\n\nSchulz submitted his ''Li'l Folks'' cartoons to [[United Features Syndicate]] (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in [[New York City]] and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as ''Li'l Folk'', that is ''Li'l Folks'' without an 's', Tack Knight who authored the retired 1930s comic strip ''Little Folks'' sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of ''Little'' to ''Li'l'' was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that ''Little Folks'' was a registered trademark.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=218}} Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program ''[[Howdy Doody]]''. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the \"Peanut Gallery\", and were referred to as \"Peanuts\". This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=219}}\n\nThe title ''Peanuts'' was hated by Schulz and was a source of humiliation throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having even seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named \"Peanuts\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=56}} One the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried ''Peanuts'', to which the newsdealer replied, \"no, and we don't have any with popcorn either\"; this event confirmed his fears concerning the title.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=87}} Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say \"I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=221}} In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to ''Charlie Brown'' on multiple occasions in the past, but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=216}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s===\n<!-- FAIR USE of First Peanuts comic.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:First Peanuts comic.png for rationale -->\n[[File:First Peanuts comic.png|thumb|500px|The first strip from October 2, 1950. From left to right: Charlie Brown, Shermy, and Patty]]\n\nThe strip began as a [[Daily comic strip|daily strip]] on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers: ''[[Minneapolis Tribune]]'', the hometown newspaper of Schulz; ''[[The Washington Post]]''; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''; ''[[The Denver Post]]''; ''[[The Seattle Times]]''; and two newspapers in [[Pennsylvania]], ''Evening Chronicle'' ([[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]) and ''Globe-Times'' ([[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]).{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=220}} The first strip was four panels long and showed Charlie Brown walking by two other young children, Shermy and Patty. Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4.<ref>{{Comic strip reference|cartoonist=[[Charles Schulz|Schulz, Charles]]|strip=Peanuts|date=October 4, 1950|syndicate=United Feature Syndicate}}</ref> Its first [[Sunday strip]] appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), \"Peppermint\" Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968) Woodstock (introduced April 1967; officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).\n\nSchulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of ''Peanuts''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nat Gertler |authorlink=Nat Gertler |title=Dale Hale and the 'Peanuts' Comic Book: The Interview | magazine=Hogan's Alley |issue=8 |date=October 2000 |publisher=Cartoonician.com}} Republished in ''[http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/ Hogan's Alley blog]'' by Tom Heintjes, May 17, 2015.</ref> Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"<ref name=\"Masters\">''Masters of American Comics'' John Carlin Yale University Press 2005</ref> Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: \"This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ |title=Charles M.

The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or [[Rugby union ball|rugby football]]. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. <!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s is generally considered to be the \"golden age\" for ''Peanuts''.<ref name=\":0\"/> During this period, some of the strip's best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, August 22, 1966 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Snoopy as the \"World War One Flying Ace\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 10, 1965 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/10/10|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Frieda and her \"naturally curly hair\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, March 06, 1961 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/03/06|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> and Franklin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, July 29, 1968 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/29|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> ''Peanuts'' is remarkable for its deft [[social commentary]], especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty's athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin's presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin's creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz's 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes>Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015).

In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2's launch of [[Laika]] the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned [[Little League]]s and \"organized\" play when all the neighborhood kids join [[snowman]]-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.<!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n''Peanuts'' touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' from 1965, features the character [[Linus van Pelt]] quoting the [[King James Version]] of the Bible (Luke 2:8\u201314) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', many have interpreted Schulz's work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/ |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=[[ImageTexT]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown's beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with Sally.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes/>\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nIn 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily ''Peanuts'' strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on [[Leap Day]] in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Later in the '90s, Schulz abandoned the characters Patty, Violet, Pig-Pen and Franklin.\n\nSchulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process.<ref>Yoe, Craig, ''Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings.''

Schulz]]\n\nThe final daily original ''Peanuts'' comic strip was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that ran past January 3, he had drawn five Sunday strips that had yet to run. The first of these appeared six days after the last daily, on January 9.\n\nOn February 13, 2000, the day after Schulz's death, the last-ever new ''Peanuts'' strip ran in papers. Three panels long, it began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the other end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with \"No, I think he's writing.\" The next panel shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter addressed to \"Dear Friends\". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to fans, which reads as follows:\n\n''{{quote|Dear Friends,<br/>\n''I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition.<br/>\n''Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip.

After ''Peanuts'' ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title ''Classic Peanuts''. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.\n\n''Peanuts'' continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of ''The Complete Peanuts'', the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]''. Additionally, [[BOOM! Studios]] has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\n\nUniversal Uclick's website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015 that they would be launching \"Peanuts Begins\", a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form.

He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip's world and serving as an [[everyman]].{{sfn|Boxer|2015}}{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Warner|2018}} While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an [[inferiority complex]]. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully build a kite.{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can either be interpreted as self-defeating stubbornness, or admirable persistence. When he fails however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity.{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} The journalist [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] observed this tension between Charlie Brown's negative and positive attitudes, stating: \"What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth[.]\"{{sfn|Caldwell 2000}} Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at [[Art Instruction Schools|Art Instruction]], whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=38}}\n\nReaders and critics have explored the question as to whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behaviour of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz's own life or childhood experiences.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=44}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview that \"I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I'm really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.\"{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=62}} He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz's \"wishy-washiness and determination\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=258}} Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=65}}\n\nSnoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a [[beagle]].{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=387}} While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=389}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=172}} He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through alter egos. Many are throwaway alter egos, such as a \"World-Famous\" magician, attorney, or surgeon.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}} His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while also being slightly selfish.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=391}} He has an arrogant committent to his independence, but is shown to be dependent on humans.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}} Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog, and that of a fantastical character.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=50}} While the inside of Snoopy's doghouse is described in the strip as being adorned with paintings of [[Andrew Wyeth|Wyeth]] and [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of [[suspension of disbelief|suspense of disbelief]] from readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Linus and Lucy===\n{{Main|Linus van Pelt|Lucy van Pelt}}\n\nLinus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother and Lucy is the older sister.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=70}}\n\nLucy is bossy and opinionated, and is used to deliver commentary on offence and honesty, as well as sarcasm.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=196}} Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but has the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=52}} He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=45}} Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and gives psychiatric advice to another character from her \"psychiatric booth\", a booth parodying the setup of a [[lemonade stand]].{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=89}} Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterised as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting \"Lucy is very much the modern doctor\".{{sfn|Yawar|2015}}\n\nLinus introduces intellectual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be \"very smart\" as well as \"dumb\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|pp=252\u2013253}} He has a tendency of expressing pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}} He finds psychological security from [[thumb sucking]] and holding a blanket for comfort, referred to as his \"security blanket\". The idea of his security blanket originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus' blanket as \"probably the single best thing that I ever thought of\". He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase \"security blanket\" entered the dictionary.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=91}}\n\n===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===\n{{Main|Peppermint Patty|Marcie}}\n\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends with each other. They attend a different school from Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}}\n\nPeppermint Patty is a [[tomboy]] who is forthright, loyal, and has what Schulz described as a \"devastating singleness of purpose\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that it serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepared for a skating competition, only to finally learn with disastrous results that it is for [[roller skating]] and not [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=94}} She struggles at school and with her homework, and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.{{sfn|J Schulz|2016}}\n\nMarcie is bookish, and a good student.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}} Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that \"she sees the truth in things\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as \"the unassuming one with sage-like insights\".{{sfn|Bradley|2015}}\n\n===Supporting characters===\n{{Main|List of Peanuts characters}}\n\nIn addition to the core cast, some other characters appeared regularly for a total of a majority of the strip's duration:\n* [[Sally Brown]] is the younger sister of Charlie Brown. She has a habit of fracturing the English language, to comical effect.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=175}} She reacts extremely negatively to school and homework, having to deal with dogmatic memorization and obeying ambiguous instructions. She otherwise confidently delivers speeches in oral exams, using wordplay and puns and framing her topics with theatrics and suspense.{{sfn|Wong|2018}}\n*[[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] is a boy who is a fanatic of the musical works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. In this relatively innocent role, he serves as an outlet for the expressions of other characters.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=82}} He most recognisably appears in the strip playing music on his toy piano.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|pp=158\u2013159}}\n* [[Pig-Pen]] is a boy who is very physically dirty, normally appearing with a cloud of dust surrounding him and in situations that involves dust and dirt. Schulz acknowledged that the scope of his role is limited, but he continued to make appearances because of his popularity with readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=96}}\n* [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]] is a boy who was introduced in order to fulfil [[African American]] representation in the strip, by the suggestion of a reader. Since it was Schulz's intention to achieve this without being patronizing, he is a relatively normal character, who mainly reacts to the oddness of other characters.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}\n* [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] is a non-speaking bird, and Snoopy's friend. He entirely communicates through peeps, forcing readers to guess what he says.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=171}} He is constantly aware that he is small and inconsequential, a role which serves as existential commentary on coping with being confused by the much larger world.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=176}}\n\nMany characters only made regular appearances for a short period of the strip's duration. For example: the characters Shermy, Patty and Violet constituted the core cast of characters around when the strip first syndicated.{{sfn|Inge|2000|pp=69\u201370}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=7}} By 1956, Patty and Violet's roles are described as an extension to Lucy's, and Shermy is described as merely \"an extra little boy\" to complete the cast of characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}} Another such character who was instead introduced later in the strip is Frieda, a girl with \"naturally curly hair\" who Schulz eventually removed for no longer having any comical value.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} Rerun however, the youngest brother of Linus and Lucy, was introduced to the strip with initially limited appearances, but became a foreground character by 1997.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=218}}\n\n==Reception==\nSchulz received the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Humor Comic Strip Award for ''Peanuts'' in 1962, the [[Reuben Award]] in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the [[Elzie Segar]] Award in 1980, and the [[Milton Caniff]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' won a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy]]; ''Peanuts'' cartoon specials have received a total of two [[Peabody Award]]s and four [[Emmys]]. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (as does Snoopy) and a place in the [[William Randolph Hearst]] Cartoon Hall of Fame.

The number of different licensed items is countless.]]\nThe characters from the comic have long been [[license]]d for use on [[merchandise]], the success of the comic strip helping to create a market for such items. In 1958, the Hungerford Plastics Corporation created a set of five [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] dolls of the most famous characters (Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and Schroeder); they expanded this line in 1961 to make the dolls slightly larger and included Sally and Pig-Pen.{{sfn|Kidd|2015|p=132}} An early example of the characters appearing in promotional material was strips and illustrations drawn by Schulz for the 1955 instructional booklet for the [[Brownie (camera)|Kodak Brownie]] camera, ''The Brownie Book of Picture Taking''.{{sfn|Groth|2016|p=35}} Another early campaign was on behalf of [[Ford Motor Company]]; magazine illustrations, brochure illustrations, and animated television spots featuring the characters were used to promote the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] from January 1960 into 1964.{{sfn|Groth|2016|p=35}} Schulz credited the Ford campaign as the first time where licensing the characters earned \"a lot of money\". However, he expressed a dislike of illustrating the adverts, describing it as \"hard work\" and would have preferred to dedicate equivalent effort to drawing the [[Sunday comics|Sunday format]] strips. {{sfn|Inge|2000|p=253}}\n\nSome licensing relationships were maintained long-term. Hallmark began printing greetings cards and party goods featuring the characters in 1960.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} In the late 1960s, [[Sanrio]] held the licensing rights in Japan for Snoopy. Sanrio is best known for [[Hello Kitty]] and its focus on the [[kawaii]] segment of the Japanese market.{{sfn|Gomez|2004}} Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the [[MetLife]] insurance company, with the intention to make the business \"more friendly and approachable\".{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}} Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=254}} In 2016 the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended.{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}}\n\nIn 1999 it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, [[vacuum flask|Thermos bottle]]s, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television,{{sfn|Elliott|2000}} appearing on products such as [[Dolly Madison]] snack cakes, [[Chex Mix]] snacks, [[Bounty (brand)|Bounty]] paper towels, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] macaroni cheese and [[A&W Root Beer]].{{sfn|Bankston|2000}}\n\nThe sheer extent to which the characters have been used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pointed out that \"some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.\"{{sfn|Tawa|2000}} Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating \"our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive\" and \"we're not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products\" while also adding \"Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It's not that we're out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we're overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=103}}\n\n===Games===\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in various video games, such as ''[[Snoopy (video game)|Snoopy]]'' in 1984 by Radarsoft, ''Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game'' by The Edge, ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular]]'' (1989, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]), ''[[Snoopy's Magic Show]]'' (1990, [[Game Boy]]), ''[[Snoopy Tennis]]'' (2001, [[Game Boy Color]]), ''[[Snoopy Concert]]'' which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the [[Super NES]], and in October 2006, a second game titled ''[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (video game)|Snoopy vs. The Red Baron]]'' by [[Namco Bandai]] for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the ''[[Snoopy the Flying Ace]]'' mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, ''[[Snoopy's Town Tale]]'' was launched for mobile by [[Pixowl]], featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\n\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the [[Funk & Wagnalls]] publishing house also produced a children's encyclopedia called the ''Charlie Brown's 'Cyclopedia''. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\n\nIn April 2002, [[List of licensed and localized editions of Monopoly: USA#P|The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly]] board game was released by USAopoly.

Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], [[Worlds of Fun]], and [[Valleyfair]] featuring various ''Peanuts''-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at [[Cedar Point]] and Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nIn 2008, [[Cedar Point]] introduced [[Planet Snoopy]], a children's area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park [[Geauga Lake]] after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. The area also consists of a \"Kids Only\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe (there is a small menu for adults). In 2010, the [[Nickelodeon Central]] and [[Nickelodeon Universe]] areas in the former [[Paramount Parks]] ([[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island]]) were replaced by [[Planet Snoopy]]. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to [[Valleyfair]], [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], and [[Worlds of Fun]], replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. Planet Snoopy is now at every Cedar Fair park beside Knott's Berry Farm and [[Michigan's Adventure]]. In 2018 Planet Snoopy was renamed Camp Snoopy & renovations were made to make these areas of the Cedar Fair parks look more like a camp. Many of the rides were renamed as well.\n\nAlso, the ''Peanuts'' characters can be found at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Hello Kitty]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schulzmuseum.org/universal-studios-japan/ |title=Charles M.

He served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of government]] of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] from 1917 to 1924 and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Ideologically a [[Communism|communist]], he developed a variant of [[Marxism]] known as [[Leninism]].\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nBorn to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother's]] 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he later campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\n\n<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->\n[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's Bolshevik government]] initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviets]], and a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] conceding territory to the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign administered by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] anti-Bolshevik armies in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. Responding to wartime devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-oriented [[New Economic Policy]]. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Empire after 1917, but three were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|re-united]] into the new [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Soviet Union]] in 1922. His health failing, Lenin died in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality|personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the [[working class]], while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime responsible for [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repression and mass killings]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Vladimir Lenin}}\n\n===Childhood: 1870\u20131887===\n[[File:Dom ulyanovyh.jpg|thumb|Lenin's childhood home in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]]]]\n\nLenin's father, [[Ilya Ulyanov|Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov]], was from a family of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]]; his ethnic origins remain unclear, with suggestions being made that he was [[Russians|Russian]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordvins|Mordvin]], or [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=7|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=21\u201323|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=13\u201315|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=6}} Despite this lower-class background Ilya had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] before teaching at the [[Institute for Nobles|Penza Institute for the Nobility]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=21\u201323|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=13\u201315|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=6}} Ilya married [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova|Maria Alexandrovna Blank]] in mid-1863.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=5|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=23}} Well educated, she was the daughter of a wealthy [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German]]\u2013[[Swedish diaspora|Swedish]] [[Lutheran]] mother, and a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] father who had [[Apostasy in Judaism|converted to Christianity]] and worked as a physician.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=16\u201319, 23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=15\u201318|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=5|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=20}} It is likely that Lenin was unaware of his mother's half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by his sister Anna after his death.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=66\u201367}} Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]] district six years later.

To do so, he believed that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as \"an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned\",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with\u2014in his words\u2014\"all citizens\" becoming \"hired employees of the state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and [[statism|statist]], with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for \"workers' control\" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a \"workers' state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43\u201344, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}\n\n[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]\n\nBefore 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}\n\nIn his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached a new stage: [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Democracy and the national question===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth.

He served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of government]] of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] from 1917 to 1924 and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Ideologically a [[Communism|communist]], he developed a variant of [[Marxism]] known as [[Leninism]].\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nBorn to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother's]] 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he later campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\n\n<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->\n[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's Bolshevik government]] initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviets]], and a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] conceding territory to the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign administered by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] anti-Bolshevik armies in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921.

To do so, he believed that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as \"an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned\",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with\u2014in his words\u2014\"all citizens\" becoming \"hired employees of the state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and [[statism|statist]], with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for \"workers' control\" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a \"workers' state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43\u201344, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}\n\n[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]\n\nBefore 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}\n\nIn his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached a new stage: [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Democracy and the national question===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth.

The artwork is not a special object\u2014it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling\u2014at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one with a sense of distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.<ref name=\"Hicks\"/>\n\nSince the photograph taken by Stieglitz is the only image of the original sculpture, there are some interpretations of ''Fountain'' by looking not only at reproductions but this particular photograph. Tomkins notes: \n\n:\"Arensberg had referred to a 'lovely form' and it does not take much stretching of the imagination to see in the upside-down urinal's gently flowing curves the veiled head of a classic Renaissance Madonna or a seated Buddha or, perhaps more to the point, one of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s polished erotic forms.\"<ref name=\"Tomkins, p. 186\"/><ref>[https://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/dur/dur5.html#N_63_ Julia D\u00fcr, ''Glasswanderers, If that\u2019s art, I\u2019m a Hottentott''], Tout-fait, Vol. 2, Issue 5, April 2003, Succession Marcel Duchamp</ref>\n\nThe meaning (if any) and intention of both the piece and the signature \"R. Mutt\", are difficult to pin down precisely. It is not clear whether Duchamp had in mind the German \"''Armut''\" (meaning \"[[poverty]]\"), or possibly \"''Urmutter''\" (meaning \u201cgreat mother\u201d).<ref name=Gammel/> The name R. Mutt could also be a play on its commercial origins or on the famous comic strip of the time, ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' (making the urinal perhaps the first work of art based on a comic).<ref>Francis M. Naumann, Beth Venn, ''Making mischief: Dada invades New York'', Harry N. Abrams, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 20.</ref> Duchamp said the R stood for Richard, French slang for \"[[Money bag#Nickname|moneybags]]\", which makes ''Fountain'' a kind of [[Feces|scatological]] [[golden calf]].<ref name=villagevoiceIdol/>\n\nRhonda Roland Shearer in the online journal ''Tout-Fait'' (2000) suspects that the Stieglitz photograph is a composite of different photos, while other scholars such as William Camfield have never been able to match the urinal shown in the photo to any urinals found in the catalogues of the time period.<ref name=\"Camfield\" />\n\nIn a 1964 interview with Otto Hahn, Duchamp suggested he purposefully selected a urinal because it was disagreeable. The choice of a urinal, according to Duchamp, \"sprang from the idea of making an experiment concerned with taste: choose the object which has the least chance of being liked.

Kuenzli states, in ''Dada and Surrealist Film'' (1996), after describing how various readymades are presented or displayed: \"This decontextualization of the object's functional place draws attention to the creation of its artistic meaning by the choice of the setting and positioning ascribed to the object.\" He goes on to explain the importance of naming the object (ascribing a title). At least three factors came into play: the choice of object, the title, and how it was modified, if at all, from its 'normal' position or location. By virtue of placing a urinal on a pedestal in an art exhibition, the illusion of an artwork was created.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=026261121X Rudolf E.

The illustration appeared as a photographic negative. Later, Duchamp made a positive version, titled ''Mirrorical Return'' (''Renvoi miroirique''; 1964). Dalia Judovitz writes:\n<blockquote>Structured as an emblem, the visual and linguistic elements set up a punning interplay that helps us to explore further the mechanisms that ''Fountain'' actively stages. On the one hand, there is the mirror-effect of the drawing and the etching, which although they are almost identical visually, involve an active switch from one artistic medium to the other. On the other hand, there is the internal mirrorical return of the image itself, since this urinal, like the one in 1917, has been rotated ninety degrees. This internal rotation disqualifies the object from its common use as a receptacle, and reactivates its poetic potential as a fountain; that is, as a machine for waterworks. The \"splash\" generated by ''Fountain'' is thus tied to its \"mirrorical return,\" like the faucet in the title.<ref name=\"Judovitz\" /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, as ''Fountain'' and other readymades were rediscovered, Duchamp became a cultural icon in the world of art, exemplified by a \"deluge of publications\", as Camfield noted, \"an unparalleled example of timing in which the burgeoning interest in Duchamp coincided with exhilarating developments in avant-garde art, virtually all of which exhibited links of some sort to Duchamp.\" His art was transformed from \"a minor, aberrant phenomenon in the history of modern art to the most dynamic force in contemporary art.\"<ref name=\"Camfield\" /><ref name=\"Lubin\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn December 2004, Duchamp's ''Fountain'' was voted the most influential artwork of the 20th century by 500 selected British art world professionals.

The artwork is not a special object\u2014it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling\u2014at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one with a sense of distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.<ref name=\"Hicks\"/>\n\nSince the photograph taken by Stieglitz is the only image of the original sculpture, there are some interpretations of ''Fountain'' by looking not only at reproductions but this particular photograph. Tomkins notes: \n\n:\"Arensberg had referred to a 'lovely form' and it does not take much stretching of the imagination to see in the upside-down urinal's gently flowing curves the veiled head of a classic Renaissance Madonna or a seated Buddha or, perhaps more to the point, one of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s polished erotic forms.\"<ref name=\"Tomkins, p. 186\"/><ref>[https://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/dur/dur5.html#N_63_ Julia D\u00fcr, ''Glasswanderers, If that\u2019s art, I\u2019m a Hottentott''], Tout-fait, Vol. 2, Issue 5, April 2003, Succession Marcel Duchamp</ref>\n\nThe meaning (if any) and intention of both the piece and the signature \"R. Mutt\", are difficult to pin down precisely. It is not clear whether Duchamp had in mind the German \"''Armut''\" (meaning \"[[poverty]]\"), or possibly \"''Urmutter''\" (meaning \u201cgreat mother\u201d).<ref name=Gammel/> The name R. Mutt could also be a play on its commercial origins or on the famous comic strip of the time, ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' (making the urinal perhaps the first work of art based on a comic).<ref>Francis M. Naumann, Beth Venn, ''Making mischief: Dada invades New York'', Harry N. Abrams, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 20.</ref> Duchamp said the R stood for Richard, French slang for \"[[Money bag#Nickname|moneybags]]\", which makes ''Fountain'' a kind of [[Feces|scatological]] [[golden calf]].<ref name=villagevoiceIdol/>\n\nRhonda Roland Shearer in the online journal ''Tout-Fait'' (2000) suspects that the Stieglitz photograph is a composite of different photos, while other scholars such as William Camfield have never been able to match the urinal shown in the photo to any urinals found in the catalogues of the time period.<ref name=\"Camfield\" />\n\nIn a 1964 interview with Otto Hahn, Duchamp suggested he purposefully selected a urinal because it was disagreeable. The choice of a urinal, according to Duchamp, \"sprang from the idea of making an experiment concerned with taste: choose the object which has the least chance of being liked. A urinal-very few people think there is anything wonderful about a urinal.\"<ref name=\"Adcock, 1987\" /><ref>Hahn, Otto, ''Marcel Duchamp'', L'Express, Paris, No. 684, 23 July 1964, p. 22.

Kuenzli states, in ''Dada and Surrealist Film'' (1996), after describing how various readymades are presented or displayed: \"This decontextualization of the object's functional place draws attention to the creation of its artistic meaning by the choice of the setting and positioning ascribed to the object.\" He goes on to explain the importance of naming the object (ascribing a title). At least three factors came into play: the choice of object, the title, and how it was modified, if at all, from its 'normal' position or location. By virtue of placing a urinal on a pedestal in an art exhibition, the illusion of an artwork was created.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=026261121X Rudolf E. Kuenzli, ''Dada and Surrealist Film''], MIT Press, 1996, p. 47, {{ISBN|026261121X}}</ref>\n\nDuchamp drew an ink copy of the 1917 Stieglitz photograph in 1964 for the cover of an exhibition catalogue, ''Marcel Duchamp: Ready-mades, etc., 1913\u20131964''. The illustration appeared as a photographic negative. Later, Duchamp made a positive version, titled ''Mirrorical Return'' (''Renvoi miroirique''; 1964). Dalia Judovitz writes:\n<blockquote>Structured as an emblem, the visual and linguistic elements set up a punning interplay that helps us to explore further the mechanisms that ''Fountain'' actively stages. On the one hand, there is the mirror-effect of the drawing and the etching, which although they are almost identical visually, involve an active switch from one artistic medium to the other. On the other hand, there is the internal mirrorical return of the image itself, since this urinal, like the one in 1917, has been rotated ninety degrees. This internal rotation disqualifies the object from its common use as a receptacle, and reactivates its poetic potential as a fountain; that is, as a machine for waterworks. The \"splash\" generated by ''Fountain'' is thus tied to its \"mirrorical return,\" like the faucet in the title.<ref name=\"Judovitz\" /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, as ''Fountain'' and other readymades were rediscovered, Duchamp became a cultural icon in the world of art, exemplified by a \"deluge of publications\", as Camfield noted, \"an unparalleled example of timing in which the burgeoning interest in Duchamp coincided with exhilarating developments in avant-garde art, virtually all of which exhibited links of some sort to Duchamp.\" His art was transformed from \"a minor, aberrant phenomenon in the history of modern art to the most dynamic force in contemporary art.\"<ref name=\"Camfield\" /><ref name=\"Lubin\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn December 2004, Duchamp's ''Fountain'' was voted the most influential artwork of the 20th century by 500 selected British art world professionals.

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters.

Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.<ref name=\"HRC award speech transcript\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|title=Lana Wachowski's HRC Visibility Award Acceptance Speech (Transcript)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026232657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\nIn February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award from [[Equality Illinois]] at their annual gala in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|title=EQIL Honors Chicago Filmmaker Lana Wachowski|work=equalityillinois.us|publisher=Equality Illinois|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626110854/http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|archivedate=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Equality Illinois to honor Chicago filmmaker Lana Wachowski |url=http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |publisher=GoPride.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125639/http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"EQIL Award Speech\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|title=Equality Illinois 2014 Gala&nbsp;\u2013 Lana Wachowski Accepts Freedom Award|date=February 21, 2014|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608035432/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|archivedate=June 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Lilly's gender transition ===\nIn March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the ''Windy City Times'' after a visit from a reporter from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.<ref name=hr20160308 /><ref name=\"var20160308\" /><ref name=\"glaad20160308\" /><ref name=windycitytimes>{{cite news| url =http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html|title= Second Wachowski filmmaker sibling comes out as trans |first=Tracy |last=Baim| work=[[Windy City Times]]| date=March 8, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2016| archivedate= March 9, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160309093348/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/09/matrix-director-lilly-wachowski-comes-out-as-a-transgender-woman|title=Film director Lilly Wachowski comes out as transgender woman|last=Davies|first=Caroline|last2=Sweney|first2=Mark|date=2016-03-09|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> In that article, she said, \"I am one of the lucky ones.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it. The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm|title=Network to Freedom Homepage|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival in Canada===\n[[File:UndergroundRailroadmonumentWindsor.jpg|175px|thumb|''International Underground Railroad Memorial'' in [[Windsor, Ontario]]]]\n[[File:John Brown by Levin Handy, 1890-1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] participated in the Underground Railroad as an abolitionist.]]\n\nEstimates vary widely, but at least 30,000 slaves, and potentially more than 100,000, escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web| url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166| work=[[Historica Minutes]]| quote=Between 1840 and 1860, more than 30,000 American slaves came secretly to Canada and freedom| title=Settling Canada Underground Railroad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106114439/http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166 |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=January 30, 2018 }}</ref> The largest group settled in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario), called [[Canada West]] from 1841.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 379</ref> Numerous [[Black Canadian]] communities developed in [[Southern Ontario]].

The abolitionist [[Levi Coffin]], who was known for aiding over 2,000 fugitives to safety,  supported this choice. He described Fort Malden as \"the great landing place, the principle terminus of the underground railroad of the west.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Landon |first=Fred |date=1925 |title=Amherstburg, Terminus of the Underground Railroad |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=5|doi=10.2307/2713665 |jstor=2713665 }}</ref> After 1850, approximately thirty fugitive slaves a day were crossing over to Fort Malden by steamboat.<ref name=Calarco>Tom Calarco, ''Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2011)</ref>{{rp|15}} The ''Sultana'' was one of the ships, making \"frequent round trips\" between [[Great Lakes]] ports.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\". Slavery in [[Upper Canada]] (now Ontario) was outlawed in 1793; in 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], the Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| title=Black History-From Slavery to Settlement| website=Archives.gov.on.ca| accessdate=June 7, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214020850/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| archivedate=February 14, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref> protect their freedom.

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".
