These applications exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and [[Calcination|calcined]] forms a moldable paste upon [[Mineral hydration|hydration]] and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification.\n\n===Hydration and dehydration reactions===\nWith judicious heating, gypsum converts to the partially dehydrated mineral called [[gypsum]] or [[plaster of Paris]]. This material has the formula CaSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7(''n''H<sub>2</sub>O), where  0.5 \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 0.8.<ref name=t/> Temperatures between {{cvt|100|and(-)|150|\u00b0C}} are required to drive off the water within its structure. The details of the temperature and time depend on ambient humidity. Temperatures as high as {{cvt|170|\u00b0C}} are used in industrial calcination, but at these temperatures \u03b3-anhydrite begins to form.  The heat energy delivered to the gypsum at this time (the heat of hydration) tends to go into driving off water (as water vapor) rather than increasing the temperature of the mineral, which rises slowly until the water is gone, then increases more rapidly.  The equation for the partial dehydration is:\n\n: CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O + {{sfrac|1|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O&uarr;\n\nThe [[endothermic]] property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of [[drywall]], conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the [[Framing (construction)|framing]] (through [[combustion]] of [[wood]] members or loss of strength of [[steel]] at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an [[oxidizing agent]]. This property is used in [[Aluminothermic reaction|aluminothermy]]. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically \"setting\" to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice:\n\n:CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O + {{sfrac|1|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O  &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThis reaction is [[exothermic]] and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for [[drywall]]), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from [[cast earth]], an alternative to [[adobe]] (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called \u03b1- and \u03b2-hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical).\n\nOn heating to {{cvt|180|\u00b0C}}, the nearly water-free form, called \u03b3-anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O where ''n'' = 0 to 0.05) is produced. \u03b3-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial [[desiccant]]s. On heating above 250&nbsp;\u00b0C, the completely anhydrous form called \u03b2-anhydrite or \"natural\" [[anhydrite]] is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground.\n\nThe variable composition of the hemihydrate and \u03b3-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing \"channels\" that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as [[methanol]].\n\n===Food industry===\nThe calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a [[flocculation|coagulant]] in products such as [[tofu]].<ref>[http://www.soymilkmaker.com/coagulant.html About tofu coagulant.]  Retrieved 9 Jan. 2008.</ref>\n\nFor the [[FDA]], it is permitted in Cheese and Related Cheese Products; Cereal Flours; Bakery Products; Frozen Desserts; Artificial Sweeteners for Jelly & Preserves; Condiment Vegetables; and Condiment Tomatoes and some candies.<ref name=pc>{{cite web |title=Compound Summary for CID 24497 - Calcium Sulfate |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/calcium_sulfate#section=Food-Additives-and-Ingredients |publisher=PubChem}}</ref>\n\nIt is known in the [[E number]] series as '''E516''', and the FAO knows it as a firming agent, a flour treatment agent, a sequestrant, and a leavening agent.<ref name=pc/>\n\n===Other uses===\n[[File:Drierite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Drierite]]\nWhen sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with [[cobalt(II) chloride]], which functions as a moisture indicator.\n\nUp to the 1970s, commercial quantities of [[sulfuric acid]] were produced in [[Whitehaven]] ([[Cumbria]], UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberates [[sulfur trioxide]] gas, a precursor in [[sulfuric acid]] production, the reaction also produces [[calcium silicate]], a mineral phase essential in [[cement]] [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] production.<ref>[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html Whitehaven Coast Archeological Survey]</ref>\n\n: CaSO<sub>4</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>\n\n==Production and occurrence== \nThe main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring [[gypsum]] and [[anhydrite]], which occur at many locations worldwide as [[evaporite]]s. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gypsum/mcs-2008-gypsu.pdf Gypsum], USGS, 2008</ref>\n\nIn addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes:\n*In [[flue-gas desulfurization]], exhaust gases from [[fossil-fuel power station]]s and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground [[limestone]] or [[calcium hydroxide|lime]]. This produces an impure [[calcium sulfite]], which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate.\n*In the production of [[phosphoric acid]] from [[apatite|phosphate rock]], calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates.\n*In the production of [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[calcium fluoride]] is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate.\n*In the refining of [[zinc]], solutions of [[zinc sulfate]] are treated with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]] to co-precipitate heavy metals such as [[barium]].\n*Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites.\n\nThese precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain [[uranium]] and its [[decay product]]s such as [[radium-226]], [[lead-210]] and [[polonium-210]].\n\nCalcium sulfate is also a common component of [[fouling]] deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility).\n\n==Retrograde solubility==\nThe dissolution of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is [[exothermic]] and releases [[heat]] (decrease in [[Enthalpy]]: \u0394H < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that can be considered as a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the [[Le Chatelier principle]] and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is [[endothermic]] (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in [[Enthalpy]]: \u0394H > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, [[calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, [[portlandite]]) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point instead of increasing its temperature.\n\n[[File:Temperature dependence calcium sulfate solubility.svg|thumb|400px|left|Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water.]]{{clear-left}}\n\nThe retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|scale]] in [[boiler]]s along with the precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]] whose [[solubility]] also decreases when [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system.\n\n==On planet Mars==\n2011 findings by the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] rover on the planet [[Mars]] show a form of calcium sulfate in a vein on the surface.

The equation for the partial dehydration is:\n\n: CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O + {{sfrac|1|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O&uarr;\n\nThe [[endothermic]] property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of [[drywall]], conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the [[Framing (construction)|framing]] (through [[combustion]] of [[wood]] members or loss of strength of [[steel]] at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an [[oxidizing agent]]. This property is used in [[Aluminothermic reaction|aluminothermy]]. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically \"setting\" to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice:\n\n:CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O + {{sfrac|1|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub>O  &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; CaSO<sub>4</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThis reaction is [[exothermic]] and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for [[drywall]]), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from [[cast earth]], an alternative to [[adobe]] (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called \u03b1- and \u03b2-hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical).\n\nOn heating to {{cvt|180|\u00b0C}}, the nearly water-free form, called \u03b3-anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O where ''n'' = 0 to 0.05) is produced. \u03b3-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial [[desiccant]]s. On heating above 250&nbsp;\u00b0C, the completely anhydrous form called \u03b2-anhydrite or \"natural\" [[anhydrite]] is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground.\n\nThe variable composition of the hemihydrate and \u03b3-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing \"channels\" that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as [[methanol]].\n\n===Food industry===\nThe calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a [[flocculation|coagulant]] in products such as [[tofu]].<ref>[http://www.soymilkmaker.com/coagulant.html About tofu coagulant.]  Retrieved 9 Jan. 2008.</ref>\n\nFor the [[FDA]], it is permitted in Cheese and Related Cheese Products; Cereal Flours; Bakery Products; Frozen Desserts; Artificial Sweeteners for Jelly & Preserves; Condiment Vegetables; and Condiment Tomatoes and some candies.<ref name=pc>{{cite web |title=Compound Summary for CID 24497 - Calcium Sulfate |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/calcium_sulfate#section=Food-Additives-and-Ingredients |publisher=PubChem}}</ref>\n\nIt is known in the [[E number]] series as '''E516''', and the FAO knows it as a firming agent, a flour treatment agent, a sequestrant, and a leavening agent.<ref name=pc/>\n\n===Other uses===\n[[File:Drierite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Drierite]]\nWhen sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with [[cobalt(II) chloride]], which functions as a moisture indicator.\n\nUp to the 1970s, commercial quantities of [[sulfuric acid]] were produced in [[Whitehaven]] ([[Cumbria]], UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberates [[sulfur trioxide]] gas, a precursor in [[sulfuric acid]] production, the reaction also produces [[calcium silicate]], a mineral phase essential in [[cement]] [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] production.<ref>[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html Whitehaven Coast Archeological Survey]</ref>\n\n: CaSO<sub>4</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>\n\n==Production and occurrence== \nThe main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring [[gypsum]] and [[anhydrite]], which occur at many locations worldwide as [[evaporite]]s. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gypsum/mcs-2008-gypsu.pdf Gypsum], USGS, 2008</ref>\n\nIn addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes:\n*In [[flue-gas desulfurization]], exhaust gases from [[fossil-fuel power station]]s and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground [[limestone]] or [[calcium hydroxide|lime]]. This produces an impure [[calcium sulfite]], which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate.\n*In the production of [[phosphoric acid]] from [[apatite|phosphate rock]], calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates.\n*In the production of [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[calcium fluoride]] is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate.\n*In the refining of [[zinc]], solutions of [[zinc sulfate]] are treated with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]] to co-precipitate heavy metals such as [[barium]].\n*Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites.\n\nThese precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain [[uranium]] and its [[decay product]]s such as [[radium-226]], [[lead-210]] and [[polonium-210]].\n\nCalcium sulfate is also a common component of [[fouling]] deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility).\n\n==Retrograde solubility==\nThe dissolution of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is [[exothermic]] and releases [[heat]] (decrease in [[Enthalpy]]: \u0394H < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that can be considered as a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the [[Le Chatelier principle]] and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is [[endothermic]] (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in [[Enthalpy]]: \u0394H > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, [[calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, [[portlandite]]) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point instead of increasing its temperature.\n\n[[File:Temperature dependence calcium sulfate solubility.svg|thumb|400px|left|Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water.]]{{clear-left}}\n\nThe retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|scale]] in [[boiler]]s along with the precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]] whose [[solubility]] also decreases when [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system.\n\n==On planet Mars==\n2011 findings by the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] rover on the planet [[Mars]] show a form of calcium sulfate in a vein on the surface.

Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure, even when she's strict with the Otto children\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money. This brought condemnation from residents, school officials, and politicians of Norwalk.

Compared to the other residents who own big houses, Katie and her family are renters of a more modest home. She lives with Greg, her level-headed husband who is a university professor of history, and their three children. Taylor is their athletic, headstrong, but somewhat dimwitted oldest daughter who wants to fit in with her peers; Oliver, their savvy, ambitious, and snarky son, is the middle child; and Anna-Kat, sweet but obsessive-compulsive, is the youngest and Katie's blatant favorite. Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure, even when she's strict with the Otto children\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money. This brought condemnation from residents, school officials, and politicians of Norwalk. After a petition calling for the producers to stop \"bullying\" Norwalk garnered over 500 signatures and received media coverage, a Disney spokesperson released a statement saying \"As a comedy, ''American Housewife'' isn\u2019t intended to offend anyone.

During the ritual, Muslim pilgrims throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars), called ''jamar\u0101t'', in the city of [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] just east of Mecca. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the Hajj. It is a symbolic reenactment of [[Abraham]]'s hajj, where he stoned three pillars representing the temptation to disobey God and preserve [[Ishmael]].\n\nOn [[Eid al-Adha]] (the 10th day of the month of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]]), pilgrims must strike one of the three ''jamraat'' (the Big Jamaraat or Al-Jamrah Al-Aqaba) with seven pebbles. After the stoning is completed on the day of Eid, every pilgrim must cut or shave their hair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hajjumrahplanner.com/day-3-10th-of-dhul-hijjah/|title=Day 3: 10th of Dhul Hijjah {{!}} Hajj & Umrah Planner|website=hajjumrahplanner.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407145347/http://hajjumrahplanner.com/day-3-10th-of-dhul-hijjah/|archive-date=2017-04-07|url-status=live}}</ref> On each of the following two days, they must hit each of the three walls with seven pebbles, going in order from east to west. Thus at least 49 pebbles are needed for the ritual, more if some throws miss. Some pilgrims stay at Mina for an additional day, in which case they must again stone each wall seven times. The pebbles used in the stoning are traditionally gathered at [[Muzdalifah]], a plain southeast of Mina, on the night before the first throwing, but can also be collected at Mina.\n\n== Replacement of the pillars ==\n\nUntil 2004, the three ''jamar\u0101t'' (singular: ''jamrah'') were tall pillars. After the 2004 Hajj, Saudi authorities replaced the pillars with {{convert|26|m||adj=mid|-long}} walls for safety; many people were accidentally throwing pebbles at people on the other side. To allow easier access to the ''jamar\u0101t'', a single-tiered pedestrian bridge called the [[Jamaraat Bridge]] was built around them, allowing pilgrims to throw stones from either ground level or from the bridge.\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' are named (starting from the east):\n\n* The first ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' (''{{}}'')the largest ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah al-kubr\u0101}}''), or Jamrah of Aqaba ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|jamrat al-\u02bfaqaba}}'').\n* The middle ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah al-wus\u1e6d\u0101}}''), \n* The smallest ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah -Al-Ula}}''),which is near Al- Kheef  Mosque,\nBefore 2004, the distance between the small and middle ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' was {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}}; between the middle and large ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' it was {{convert|225|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Muhammad H. |last=Al-Haboubi |title=A New Layout Design for the Jamarat Area (Stoning the Devil) |journal=The Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering |volume=28 |issue=2B |date=October 2003 |citeseerx=10.1.1.133.6854 }}</ref>\n\n== Historical and spiritual significance ==\n\nThe ritual re-enacts [[Abraham]] ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibr\u0101h\u012bm]])'s pilgrimage to Mecca as explained by the [[Muslim]] historian [[al-Azraqi]]:\n\n<blockquote>When he [Abraham] left Mina and was brought down to (the defile called) al-Aqaba, the [[Devil (Islam)|Devil]] appeared to him at Stone-Heap of the Defile. [[Gabriel]] ([[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibrayil]]) said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so Abraham threw seven stones at him so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Middle Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so he pelted him with seven stones so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Little Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so he pelted him with seven stones like the little stones for throwing with a [[sling (weapon)|sling]]. So the Devil withdrew from him.<ref>F.E. Peters, ''A Reader on Classical Islam'', Princeton University Press, 1994 ({{ISBN|0-691-03394-3}})</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll three ''jamar\u0101t'' represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of Abraham against sacrificing [[Ishmael]] ([[Ishmael in Islam|Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl]]); the second represents the temptation of Abraham's wife [[Hagar]] ([[Hagar in Islam|H\u0101jar]]) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of Ishmael to avoid being sacrificed. He was rebuked each time, and the throwing of the stones symbolizes those rebukes.\n\nThe stoning of the ''jamar\u0101t'' also represents the repudiation of man's self (''{{transl|ar|an-nafs al-'am\u0101ra}}'', literally the \"internal despot\") and the act of casting aside one's low desires and wishes. As one Islamic theologian states:\n\n{{quote|If one is able to crush ''al\u2011nafs al\u2011'am\u0101ra'' during the stoning of ''Jamrat al\u2011\u02bfAqaba'' (the Jamrah of Aqaba), then one has taken the next step in attaining closeness to [[God in Islam|Allah]], and since between the servant and [[Allah]] there is no more than the distance of one step, if one has been able to take this step and make it past one's own low desires and wishes, then that which follows is the level of closeness to Allah.\n\nDuring those two or three days after the Eid that one is in Mina, one must stone the three ''jamar\u0101t'', meaning that one must trample upon his internal despot (''an-nafs al-'am\u0101ra''), the external despot of the [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] from the [[Genie|Jinn]] (Ibl\u012bs and those like him), and the Shay\u1e6d\u0101n from among the Humans (the enemies of religion and of humanity).\n\nThe stoning of the three ''jamar\u0101t'' is, in essence, the trampling upon the despots and waging war against all of them. When one focuses on them and the hatred for them, then one automatically focuses with complete attention upon one's self \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 while stoning the ''jamar\u0101t'', one must focus entirely upon one's self. It is an attack on a person's internal temptations or base desires, and signals a moving away from the self and towards further submission to Allah's will.<ref>Ayatollah al Hajj ash\u2011Shaikh Husain Mazaheri, ''[http://al-islam.org/secretsofthehajj/5.htm Secret of the Hajj] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228061542/http://www.al-islam.org/secretsofthehajj/5.htm |date=2010-12-28 }}''.</ref>}}\n\n== Incidents ==\n{{main|Incidents during the Hajj}}\n\nThe Stoning of the Devil ritual is considered the most dangerous part of the pilgrimage, as sudden crowd movements on or near the Jamaraat Bridge can cause people to be crushed. On several occasions, thousands of participants have suffocated or been trampled to death in [[stampede]]s.\n\nAn important step in managing crowds is the recent replacement of the ''jamar\u0101t'' pillars by walls to ease and speed up the stoning. The bridge has also been widened in recent years to accommodate the ever-growing number of pilgrims who perform the Hajj each year.\n\nCrowd conditions are especially difficult during the final day of Hajj, which is the day pilgrims leave the valley of Mina and return to Mecca for the farewell ''[[Tawaf]]'' (the final circumambulation of the [[Kaaba]]). According to [[hadith]], [[Muhammad]]'s last stoning was performed just after the [[Dhuhr|noon prayer]]. Many scholars feel that the ritual can be done any time between noon and sunset on this day; however, many Muslims are taught that it should be done immediately after the noon prayer. This leads to people camping out until noon and rushing out then to do the stoning.\n\nThese two factors have been said to be most responsible for a stampede during the Hajj of 2006 which killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured at least 289 more. This was despite several attempts by the authorities to inform pilgrims about the permissibility of staggering their visits to the ''jamar\u0101t'' as well as instructing them to leave their luggage at their tents. Adding to the confusion involved in the tragedy is the lack of co-operation on the part of pilgrims who do not leave the ''jamar\u0101t'' area by the proper route, and therefore interfere with the movements of others who are arriving.\n\nAnother crush occurred on September 24, 2015, in Mina when at least 2,411 pilgrims were killed, a new Associated Press count shows, three times the number of deaths acknowledged by the kingdom three months later.<ref name=\"ap_crush\">{{cite news |last=Gambrell |first=Jon |date=10 November 2015 |title=AP count: Over 2,400 killed in Saudi hajj stampede, crush |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-ap-count-over-2400-killed-in-saudi-hajj-stampede-crush-2015-12 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191117/http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-ap-count-over-2400-killed-in-saudi-hajj-stampede-crush-2015-12 |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The AP figures establish the Sept. 24 crush at Mina as the deadliest in the history of the annual pilgrimage. It occurred just weeks after a fatal crane collapse in Mecca.\n\nAuthorities have said the Mina crush and stampede occurred when two waves of pilgrims converged on a narrow road, suffocating or trampling to death those caught in the disaster.<ref name=\"ap_crush\"/>\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, required of every able-bodied Muslim once in his or her life, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult. The hajj in 2015 drew some two million pilgrims, though in recent years it has drawn more than three million without any major incidents.\n\nHowever, experts have said that the density of the crowds is very likely to lead to a [[crowd collapse]] in such circumstances. Edwin Galea of the [[University of Greenwich]] said: \"If you\u2019re designing an event to handle that crowd density, it's inherently dangerous.\" He pointed out that the 500,000 people an hour who could cross the Jamarat bridge after it was widened in 2004 is equivalent to the largest-ever football crowd once every 24 minutes or the population of Germany in a week. One possible solution would be to spread the Hajj over a longer period.<ref name=Benedictus3Oct>{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Benedictus |date=3 October 2015 |title=Hajj crush: how crowd disasters happen, and how they can be avoided |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=4 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702223626/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jamarat Bridge]]\n* [[Burning of Judas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hajj topics |expanded}}\n{{coord|21.4212|N|39.8726|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Hajj]]\n[[Category:Mecca]]\n[[Category:Satan]]\n[[Category:Hajj terminology]]\n[[Category:Abraham]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Ramy|the [[Hulu]] television series|Ramy (TV series)}}\n[[File:Mecca2.jpg|300px|thumb|A stoning of the Devil from 1942]]\nThe {{citation needed span|'''Stoning of the Devil'''|date=November 2019}} ({{lang-ar|{{large|\u0631\u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a|}}}} '''''{{transl|ar|ramy al-jamar\u0101t}}''''', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"[[stone throwing|throwing]] of the ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' [place of pebbles]\")<ref>{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard Francis|authorlink=Richard Francis Burton|title=Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts|url=https://archive.org/details/personalnarrati02burtgoog|year=1857|page=[https://archive.org/details/personalnarrati02burtgoog/page/n262 226]|quote=The word ''jamrah'' is applied to the place of stoning, as well as to the stones.|access-date=2016-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Ab\u016b D\u0101\u02bc\u016bd |title=Sunan Abu Dawud: Chapters 519-1337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwvYAAAAMAAJ |year=1984 |publisher=Sh.

To allow easier access to the ''jamar\u0101t'', a single-tiered pedestrian bridge called the [[Jamaraat Bridge]] was built around them, allowing pilgrims to throw stones from either ground level or from the bridge.\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' are named (starting from the east):\n\n* The first ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' (''{{}}'')the largest ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah al-kubr\u0101}}''), or Jamrah of Aqaba ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|jamrat al-\u02bfaqaba}}'').\n* The middle ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah al-wus\u1e6d\u0101}}''), \n* The smallest ''{{transl|ar|jamrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|ar|al-jamrah -Al-Ula}}''),wich is near Al- Kheef  Mosque,\nBefore 2004, the distance between the small and middle ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' was {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}}; between the middle and large ''{{transl|ar|jamar\u0101t}}'' it was {{convert|225|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Muhammad H. |last=Al-Haboubi |title=A New Layout Design for the Jamarat Area (Stoning the Devil) |journal=The Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering |volume=28 |issue=2B |date=October 2003 |citeseerx=10.1.1.133.6854 }}</ref>\n\n== Historical and spiritual significance ==\n\nThe ritual re-enacts [[Abraham]] ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibr\u0101h\u012bm]])'s pilgrimage to Mecca as explained by the [[Muslim]] historian [[al-Azraqi]]:\n\n<blockquote>When he [Abraham] left Mina and was brought down to (the defile called) al-Aqaba, the [[Devil (Islam)|Devil]] appeared to him at Stone-Heap of the Defile. [[Gabriel]] ([[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibrayil]]) said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so Abraham threw seven stones at him so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Middle Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so he pelted him with seven stones so that he disappeared from him. Then he appeared to him at the Little Stone-Heap. Gabriel said to him: \"Pelt him!\" so he pelted him with seven stones like the little stones for throwing with a [[sling (weapon)|sling]]. So the Devil withdrew from him.<ref>F.E. Peters, ''A Reader on Classical Islam'', Princeton University Press, 1994 ({{ISBN|0-691-03394-3}})</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll three ''jamar\u0101t'' represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of Abraham against sacrificing [[Ishmael]] ([[Ishmael in Islam|Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl]]); the second represents the temptation of Abraham's wife [[Hagar]] ([[Hagar in Islam|H\u0101jar]]) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of Ishmael to avoid being sacrificed. He was rebuked each time, and the throwing of the stones symbolizes those rebukes.\n\nThe stoning of the ''jamar\u0101t'' also represents the repudiation of man's self (''{{transl|ar|an-nafs al-'am\u0101ra}}'', literally the \"internal despot\") and the act of casting aside one's low desires and wishes. As one Islamic theologian states:\n\n{{quote|If one is able to crush ''al\u2011nafs al\u2011'am\u0101ra'' during the stoning of ''Jamrat al\u2011\u02bfAqaba'' (the Jamrah of Aqaba), then one has taken the next step in attaining closeness to [[God in Islam|Allah]], and since between the servant and [[Allah]] there is no more than the distance of one step, if one has been able to take this step and make it past one's own low desires and wishes, then that which follows is the level of closeness to Allah.\n\nDuring those two or three days after the Eid that one is in Mina, one must stone the three ''jamar\u0101t'', meaning that one must trample upon his internal despot (''an-nafs al-'am\u0101ra''), the external despot of the [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] from the [[Genie|Jinn]] (Ibl\u012bs and those like him), and the Shay\u1e6d\u0101n from among the Humans (the enemies of religion and of humanity).\n\nThe stoning of the three ''jamar\u0101t'' is, in essence, the trampling upon the despots and waging war against all of them. When one focuses on them and the hatred for them, then one automatically focuses with complete attention upon one's self \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 while stoning the ''jamar\u0101t'', one must focus entirely upon one's self. It is an attack on a person's internal temptations or base desires, and signals a moving away from the self and towards further submission to Allah's will.<ref>Ayatollah al Hajj ash\u2011Shaikh Husain Mazaheri, ''[http://al-islam.org/secretsofthehajj/5.htm Secret of the Hajj] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228061542/http://www.al-islam.org/secretsofthehajj/5.htm |date=2010-12-28 }}''.</ref>}}\n\n== Incidents ==\n{{main|Incidents during the Hajj}}\n\nThe Stoning of the Devil ritual is considered the most dangerous part of the pilgrimage, as sudden crowd movements on or near the Jamaraat Bridge can cause people to be crushed. On several occasions, thousands of participants have suffocated or been trampled to death in [[stampede]]s.\n\nAn important step in managing crowds is the recent replacement of the ''jamar\u0101t'' pillars by walls to ease and speed up the stoning. The bridge has also been widened in recent years to accommodate the ever-growing number of pilgrims who perform the Hajj each year.\n\nCrowd conditions are especially difficult during the final day of Hajj, which is the day pilgrims leave the valley of Mina and return to Mecca for the farewell ''[[Tawaf]]'' (the final circumambulation of the [[Kaaba]]). According to [[hadith]], [[Muhammad]]'s last stoning was performed just after the [[Dhuhr|noon prayer]]. Many scholars feel that the ritual can be done any time between noon and sunset on this day; however, many Muslims are taught that it should be done immediately after the noon prayer. This leads to people camping out until noon and rushing out then to do the stoning.\n\nThese two factors have been said to be most responsible for a stampede during the Hajj of 2006 which killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured at least 289 more. This was despite several attempts by the authorities to inform pilgrims about the permissibility of staggering their visits to the ''jamar\u0101t'' as well as instructing them to leave their luggage at their tents. Adding to the confusion involved in the tragedy is the lack of co-operation on the part of pilgrims who do not leave the ''jamar\u0101t'' area by the proper route, and therefore interfere with the movements of others who are arriving.\n\nAnother crush occurred on September 24, 2015, in Mina when at least 2,411 pilgrims were killed, a new Associated Press count shows, three times the number of deaths acknowledged by the kingdom three months later.<ref name=\"ap_crush\">{{cite news |last=Gambrell |first=Jon |date=10 November 2015 |title=AP count: Over 2,400 killed in Saudi hajj stampede, crush |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-ap-count-over-2400-killed-in-saudi-hajj-stampede-crush-2015-12 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191117/http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-ap-count-over-2400-killed-in-saudi-hajj-stampede-crush-2015-12 |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The AP figures establish the Sept. 24 crush at Mina as the deadliest in the history of the annual pilgrimage. It occurred just weeks after a fatal crane collapse in Mecca.\n\nAuthorities have said the Mina crush and stampede occurred when two waves of pilgrims converged on a narrow road, suffocating or trampling to death those caught in the disaster.<ref name=\"ap_crush\"/>\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, required of every able-bodied Muslim once in his or her life, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult. The hajj in 2015 drew some two million pilgrims, though in recent years it has drawn more than three million without any major incidents.\n\nHowever, experts have said that the density of the crowds is very likely to lead to a [[crowd collapse]] in such circumstances. Edwin Galea of the [[University of Greenwich]] said: \"If you\u2019re designing an event to handle that crowd density, it's inherently dangerous.\" He pointed out that the 500,000 people an hour who could cross the Jamarat bridge after it was widened in 2004 is equivalent to the largest-ever football crowd once every 24 minutes or the population of Germany in a week. One possible solution would be to spread the Hajj over a longer period.<ref name=Benedictus3Oct>{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Benedictus |date=3 October 2015 |title=Hajj crush: how crowd disasters happen, and how they can be avoided |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=4 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702223626/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jamarat Bridge]]\n* [[Burning of Judas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hajj topics |expanded}}\n{{coord|21.4212|N|39.8726|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Hajj]]\n[[Category:Mecca]]\n[[Category:Satan]]\n[[Category:Hajj terminology]]\n[[Category:Abraham]]\n", "name_user": "BrainVE", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning_of_the_Devil"}

As the Health Commissioner of New York State (and former head of the PHS Venereal Disease Division), Parran was asked by the Rosenwald Fund to make an assessment of their survey and demonstration projects in six Southern states. Among his conclusions was the recommendation that, \"If one wished to study the natural history of syphilis in the Negro race uninfluenced by treatment, this county (Macon) would be an ideal location for such a study.\"<ref>{{Cite newspaper|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|title=Did a U.S surgeon general come up with the idea of the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment|author = Bender W |date=July 20, 2017 | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/news/thomas-parran-tuskegee-syphilis-hornblum-experiment-20170720.html }}</ref>\n\nAn official committee at the University of Pittsburgh reported the following on Thomas Parran, M.D., who was a founder of the university's Graduate School of Public Health: \u201cDr. Parran\u2019s role, and the extent of his influence in approving, funding, and providing oversight of the Tuskegee and Guatemalan studies, is not entirely clear.

[[Eugene Heriot Dibble, Jr.]], an African-American doctor, was head of the John Andrew Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute. (From 1936\u20131946, he served as director of the [[Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center]], established in 1923 in the city by the federal government on land donated by the Institute.)\n\n[[File:Oliver Wenger.jpg|thumb|upright|Oliver Wenger]]\nOliver C. Wenger was the director of the regional PHS Venereal Disease Clinic in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. He and his staff took the lead in developing study procedures. Wenger and his staff played a critical role in developing early study protocols. Wenger continued to advise and assist the Tuskegee Study when it was adapted as a long-term, no-treatment observational study after funding for treatment was lost.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=DiClemente RJ, Blumenthal DS |title=Community-based health research: issues and methods |publisher=Springer Pub |location=New York |year=2003 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-8261-2025-0 |oclc= |url = http://www.google.co.in/books?id=KN_-9lwSI5oC |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nRaymond A. Vonderlehr was appointed on-site director of the research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project. His method of gaining the \"[[informed consent|consent]]\" of the subjects for [[lumbar puncture|spinal taps]] (to look for signs of [[neurosyphilis]]) was by portraying this diagnostic test as a \"special free treatment\". Participants were not told their diagnosis. Vonderlehr retired as head of the venereal disease section in 1943, shortly after the antibiotic [[penicillin]] had first been shown to be a cure for syphilis.<ref name=Brandt/>\n\nSeveral [[African American]] health workers and educators associated with [[Tuskegee Institute]] helped the PHS to carry out its experimentation and played a critical role in the progress of the study. The extent to which they knew about the full scope of the study is not clear in all cases. [[Robert Russa Moton]], then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute's John Andrews Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Registered nurse [[Eunice Rivers]], who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the main contact with the participants in the study.\n\nVonderlehr advocated for Rivers' participation, as the direct link to the regional African-American community. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the Tuskegee Study recruited poor lower-class African Americans, who often could not afford health care, by offering them the chance to join \"Miss Rivers' Lodge\". Patients were told they would receive free physical examinations at [[Tuskegee University]], free rides to and from the clinic, hot meals on examination days, and free treatment for minor ailments.\n\nBased on the available health care resources, Rivers believed that the benefits of the study to the men outweighed the risks. As the study became long term, Rivers became the chief person with continuity. Unlike the national, regional and on-site PHS administrators, doctors, and researchers, some of whom were political appointees with short tenure and others who changed jobs, Rivers continued at Tuskegee University. She was the only study staff person to work with participants for the full 40 years. By the 1950s, Nurse Rivers had become pivotal to the study: her personal knowledge of the subjects enabled maintenance of long-term follow up.\n\nIn 1943, Congress passed the Henderson Act, a public health law requiring testing and treatment for venereal disease. By the late 1940s, doctors, hospitals and public health centers throughout the country routinely treated diagnosed syphilis with penicillin. However, the Tuskegee experiment continued to avoid treating the men who had the disease.\n\nIn the period following World War II, the revelation of [[the Holocaust]] and related [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical abuses]] brought about changes in international law. Western allies formulated the [[Nuremberg Code]] to protect the rights of research subjects. In 1964 the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Declaration of Helsinki]] specified that experiments involving human beings needed the \"informed consent\" of participants. But no one appeared to have reevaluated the protocols of the Tuskegee Study according to the new standards and in light of treatment available for the disease which is fatal 8\u201358% of the time. On July 25, 1972, word of the Tuskegee Study was reported by Jean Heller of the Associated Press; the next day ''[[The New York Times]]'' carried it on its front page, and the story captured national attention. Peter Buxtun, a [[whistleblower]] who was a former PHS interviewer for venereal disease, had leaked information after failing to get a response to his protests about the study within the department. He gave information to the ''[[Washington Star]]'' and ''The New York Times''. [[John R. Heller Jr.]] of PHS, who in later years of the study led the national division, still defended the [[medical ethics|ethics]] of the study, stating, \"The longer the study, the better the ultimate information we would derive.\"<ref>Jones, James H. ''Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,'' p. 179.</ref> Author James Jones editorialized about Heller, suggesting that his opinion was, \"The men's status did not warrant ethical debate.

This study, known as the \"Oslo study of untreated syphilis\", was a [[retrospective study]], since investigators pieced together information from the histories of patients who had already contracted syphilis but remained untreated for some time.\n[[File:Tuskegee-syphilis-study subjects-talking-to-nurse-eunice-rivers.jpg|thumb|Subjects talking with study coordinator, Nurse Eunice Rivers, c.1970]]\n\nThe Tuskegee study group decided to build on the Oslo work and perform a [[prospective study]] to complement it. Researchers could study the natural progression of the disease as long as they did not harm their subjects. The researchers involved with the Tuskegee experiment reasoned that they were not harming the black men involved in the study because they were unlikely to get treatment for their syphilis and further education would not diminish their inherent sex drive. However, even at the beginning of the study, major medical textbooks had recommended that all syphilis be treated, as the consequences were quite severe. At that time, treatment included arsenic therapy and the [[Arsphenamine|\"606\" formula]].<ref name=Brandt/>  The researchers reasoned that the knowledge gained would benefit humankind; however, it was determined afterward that the doctors did harm their subjects by depriving them of appropriate treatment once it had been discovered. The study was characterized as \"the longest non-therapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history.\"<ref name=\"nyfp\">{{cite book|author=Jones J|title=Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment|isbn=978-0-02-916676-5|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|year=1981|url=https://archive.org/details/badbloodtuskegee00jone_0}}</ref>\n\nThe US Public Health Study of Syphilis at Tuskegee began as a 6-month descriptive epidemiological study of the range of pathology associated with syphilis in the [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon County]] population. At that time, it was believed that the effects of syphilis depended on the race of those affected. For African Americans, physicians believed that their cardiovascular system was more affected than the central nervous system.<ref>Murphy, Timothy F. \"The Tuskegee Syphilis Studies,\" in ''Case Studies in Biomedical Research Ethics.''

Study directors issued a final report as they thought this might mean the end of the study once funding to buy medication for the treatment phase of the study was withdrawn.\n\n[[Medical ethics]] considerations were limited from the start and rapidly deteriorated. The PHS asked black Tuskegee Institute physicians to participate in the study by offering funds, employment, and interns to encourage the ongoing participation of the patients. Additionally, the study intentionally employed Eunice Rivers, a black nurse from Macon County, to be primary source of contact and build personal, trusting relationships with patients to promote their participation.<ref name=\"shadow\" /> To ensure that the men would show up for the possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic [[Lumbar puncture|spinal taps]], the doctors sent the 400 patients a misleading letter titled \"Last Chance for Special Free Treatment\".<ref name=Brandt/>  The study also required all participants to undergo an [[autopsy]] after death in order to receive funeral benefits.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] (CDC), which by then controlled the study, reaffirmed the need to continue the study until completion; i.e., until all subjects had died and been autopsied.  To bolster its position, the CDC received unequivocal support for the continuation of the study, both from local chapters of the [[National Medical Association]] (representing African-American physicians) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).\n\nIn 1968 [[William Carter Jenkins]], an African-American statistician in the [[U.S. Public Health Service|PHS]], part of the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW), founded and edited ''The Drum'', a newsletter devoted to ending racial [[discrimination]] in HEW. The cabinet-level department included the CDC. In ''The Drum'', Jenkins called for an end to the Tuskegee Study. He did not succeed; it is not clear who read his work.{{efn|Bill Jenkins left the PHS in the mid-1970s for doctoral studies.

The story broke first in the ''[[Washington Star]]'' on July 25, 1972. It became front-page news in the ''[[New York Times]]'' the following day. Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] called [[Congressional hearings]], at which Buxtun and HEW officials testified. As a result of public outcry, the CDC and PHS appointed an ''[[ad hoc]]'' advisory panel to review the study. The panel found that the men agreed to certain terms of the experiment, such as examination and treatment. However, they were not informed of the study's actual purpose.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> The panel then determined the study was medically unjustified and ordered its termination.\n\nAs part of the settlement of a [[class action lawsuit]] subsequently filed by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] on behalf of study participants and their descendants, the U.S. government paid $10 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1974}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and to surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study; Congress created a commission empowered to write regulations to deter such abuses from occurring in the future.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nA collection of materials compiled to investigate the study is held at the [[National Library of Medicine]] in Bethesda, Maryland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/tuskegee264|title=Documents on the origin and development of the Tuskegee syphilis study 1921-1973|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 1974 Congress passed the [[National Research Act]] and created a [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research|commission]] to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials. Now studies require [[informed consent]],<ref name=\"hhs.gov\"/> communication of [[diagnosis]] and accurate reporting of test results.<ref name=\"hsl.virginia.edu\"/> Institutional review boards (IRBs), including laypeople, are established in scientific research groups and hospitals to review study protocols and protect patient interests, to ensure that participants are fully informed.\n\nIn 1994, a multi-disciplinary symposium was held on the Tuskegee study: ''Doing Bad in the Name of Good?: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Its Legacy'' at the [[University of Virginia]]. Following that, interested parties formed the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee to develop ideas that had arisen at the symposium. It issued its final report in May 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/badblood/ |title= Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study | publisher = University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.| accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The Committee had two related goals: (1) President [[Bill Clinton]] should publicly apologize for past government wrongdoing related to the study and (2) the Committee and relevant federal agencies should develop a strategy to redress the damages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/badblood/report/ |title= Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study: Final Report of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | publisher = University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.| accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA year later on May 16, 1997, Bill Clinton formally apologized and held a ceremony at the White House for surviving Tuskegee study participants. He said:\n\n<blockquote>What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry... To our African American citizens, I am sorry that your federal government orchestrated a study so clearly racist.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html\n|title=Remarks by the President in apology for study done in Tuskegee\n|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House\n|date=May 16, 1997\n|accessdate=September 6, 2009\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090548/http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html\n|archive-date=October 11, 2014\n|url-status=dead\n|df=mdy-all\n}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nFive of the eight study survivors attended the White House ceremony.\n\nThe presidential apology led to progress in addressing the second goal of the Legacy Committee.

As the Health Commissioner of New York State (and former head of the PHS Venereal Disease Division), Parran was asked by the Rosenwald Fund to make an assessment of their survey and demonstration projects in six Southern states. Among his conclusions was the recommendation that, \"If one wished to study the natural history of syphilis in the Negro race uninfluenced by treatment, this county (Macon) would be an ideal location for such a study.\"<ref>{{Cite newspaper|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|title=Did a U.S surgeon general come up with the idea of the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment|author = Bender W |date=July 20, 2017 | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/news/thomas-parran-tuskegee-syphilis-hornblum-experiment-20170720.html }}</ref>\n\nAn official committee at the University of Pittsburgh reported the following on Thomas Parran, M.D., who was a founder of the university's Graduate School of Public Health: \u201cDr. Parran\u2019s role, and the extent of his influence in approving, funding, and providing oversight of the Tuskegee and Guatemalan studies, is not entirely clear.

[[Eugene Heriot Dibble, Jr.]], an African-American doctor, was head of the John Andrew Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute. (From 1936\u20131946, he served as director of the [[Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center]], established in 1923 in the city by the federal government on land donated by the Institute.)\n\n[[File:Oliver Wenger.jpg|thumb|upright|Oliver Wenger]]\nOliver C.

Vonderlehr was appointed on-site director of the research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project. His method of gaining the \"[[informed consent|consent]]\" of the subjects for [[lumbar puncture|spinal taps]] (to look for signs of [[neurosyphilis]]) was by portraying this diagnostic test as a \"special free treatment\". Participants were not told their diagnosis. Vonderlehr retired as head of the venereal disease section in 1943, shortly after the antibiotic [[penicillin]] had first been shown to be a cure for syphilis.<ref name=Brandt/>\n\nSeveral [[African American]] health workers and educators associated with [[Tuskegee Institute]] helped the PHS to carry out its experimentation and played a critical role in the progress of the study. The extent to which they knew about the full scope of the study is not clear in all cases. [[Robert Russa Moton]], then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute's John Andrews Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Registered nurse [[Eunice Rivers]], who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the main contact with the participants in the study.\n\nVonderlehr advocated for Rivers' participation, as the direct link to the regional African-American community. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the Tuskegee Study recruited poor lower-class African Americans, who often could not afford health care, by offering them the chance to join \"Miss Rivers' Lodge\". Patients were told they would receive free physical examinations at [[Tuskegee University]], free rides to and from the clinic, hot meals on examination days, and free treatment for minor ailments.\n\nBased on the available health care resources, Rivers believed that the benefits of the study to the men outweighed the risks. As the study became long term, Rivers became the chief person with continuity. Unlike the national, regional and on-site PHS administrators, doctors, and researchers, some of whom were political appointees with short tenure and others who changed jobs, Rivers continued at Tuskegee University. She was the only study staff person to work with participants for the full 40 years. By the 1950s, Nurse Rivers had become pivotal to the study: her personal knowledge of the subjects enabled maintenance of long-term follow up.\n\nIn 1943, Congress passed the Henderson Act, a public health law requiring testing and treatment for venereal disease. By the late 1940s, doctors, hospitals and public health centers throughout the country routinely treated diagnosed syphilis with penicillin. However, the Tuskegee experiment continued to avoid treating the men who had the disease.\n\nIn the period following World War II, the revelation of [[the Holocaust]] and related [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical abuses]] brought about changes in international law. Western allies formulated the [[Nuremberg Code]] to protect the rights of research subjects. In 1964 the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Declaration of Helsinki]] specified that experiments involving human beings needed the \"informed consent\" of participants. But no one appeared to have reevaluated the protocols of the Tuskegee Study according to the new standards and in light of treatment available for the disease which is fatal 8\u201358% of the time. On July 25, 1972, word of the Tuskegee Study was reported by Jean Heller of the Associated Press; the next day ''[[The New York Times]]'' carried it on its front page, and the story captured national attention. Peter Buxtun, a [[whistleblower]] who was a former PHS interviewer for venereal disease, had leaked information after failing to get a response to his protests about the study within the department. He gave information to the ''[[Washington Star]]'' and ''The New York Times''. [[John R. Heller Jr.]] of PHS, who in later years of the study led the national division, still defended the [[medical ethics|ethics]] of the study, stating, \"The longer the study, the better the ultimate information we would derive.\"<ref>Jones, James H. ''Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,'' p. 179.</ref> Author James Jones editorialized about Heller, suggesting that his opinion was, \"The men's status did not warrant ethical debate.

This study, known as the \"Oslo study of untreated syphilis\", was a [[retrospective study]], since investigators pieced together information from the histories of patients who had already contracted syphilis but remained untreated for some time.\n[[File:Tuskegee-syphilis-study subjects-talking-to-nurse-eunice-rivers.jpg|thumb|Subjects talking with study coordinator, Nurse Eunice Rivers, c.1970]]\n\nThe Tuskegee study group decided to build on the Oslo work and perform a [[prospective study]] to complement it. Researchers could study the natural progression of the disease as long as they did not harm their subjects. The researchers involved with the Tuskegee experiment reasoned that they were not harming the black men involved in the study because they were unlikely to get treatment for their syphilis and further education would not diminish their inherent sex drive. However, even at the beginning of the study, major medical textbooks had recommended that all syphilis be treated, as the consequences were quite severe. At that time, treatment included arsenic therapy and the [[Arsphenamine|\"606\" formula]].<ref name=Brandt/>  The researchers reasoned that the knowledge gained would benefit humankind; however, it was determined afterward that the doctors did harm their subjects by depriving them of appropriate treatment once it had been discovered. The study was characterized as \"the longest non-therapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history.\"<ref name=\"nyfp\">{{cite book|author=Jones J|title=Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment|isbn=978-0-02-916676-5|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|year=1981|url=https://archive.org/details/badbloodtuskegee00jone_0}}</ref>\n\nThe US Public Health Study of Syphilis at Tuskegee began as a 6-month descriptive epidemiological study of the range of pathology associated with syphilis in the [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon County]] population. At that time, it was believed that the effects of syphilis depended on the race of those affected. For African Americans, physicians believed that their cardiovascular system was more affected than the central nervous system.<ref>Murphy, Timothy F. \"The Tuskegee Syphilis Studies,\" in ''Case Studies in Biomedical Research Ethics.''

Study directors issued a final report as they thought this might mean the end of the study once funding to buy medication for the treatment phase of the study was withdrawn.\n\n[[Medical ethics]] considerations were limited from the start and rapidly deteriorated. The PHS asked black Tuskegee Institute physicians to participate in the study by offering funds, employment, and interns to encourage the ongoing participation of the patients. Additionally, the study intentionally employed Eunice Rivers, a black nurse from Macon County, to be primary source of contact and build personal, trusting relationships with patients to promote their participation.<ref name=\"shadow\" /> To ensure that the men would show up for the possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic [[Lumbar puncture|spinal taps]], the doctors sent the 400 patients a misleading letter titled \"Last Chance for Special Free Treatment\".<ref name=Brandt/>  The study also required all participants to undergo an [[autopsy]] after death in order to receive funeral benefits.

Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications, 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their children were born with [[congenital syphilis]].

In 1965, Schatz read an article about the study in a medical journal, and wrote a letter directly to the study's authors confronting them with a declaration of brazen unethical practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/20/dr-irwin-schatz-the-first-lonely-voice-against-infamous-tuskegee-study-dies-at-83/|title=Dr. Irwin Schatz, the first, lonely voice against infamous Tuskegee study, dies at 83|website=Washington Post}}</ref> His letter, read by Anne R. Yobs (one of the study's authors), was immediately ignored and filed away with a brief memo that no reply would be sent.\n\nIn 1966 [[Peter Buxtun]], a PHS venereal-disease investigator in San Francisco, sent a letter to the national director of the Division of Venereal Diseases to express his concerns about the ethics and morality of the extended Tuskegee Study. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] (CDC), which by then controlled the study, reaffirmed the need to continue the study until completion; i.e., until all subjects had died and been autopsied.  To bolster its position, the CDC received unequivocal support for the continuation of the study, both from local chapters of the [[National Medical Association]] (representing African-American physicians) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).\n\nIn 1968 [[William Carter Jenkins]], an African-American statistician in the [[U.S. Public Health Service|PHS]], part of the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW), founded and edited ''The Drum'', a newsletter devoted to ending racial [[discrimination]] in HEW. The cabinet-level department included the CDC. In ''The Drum'', Jenkins called for an end to the Tuskegee Study. He did not succeed; it is not clear who read his work.{{efn|Bill Jenkins left the PHS in the mid-1970s for doctoral studies. In 1980, he joined the CDC Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, where he managed the Participants Health Benefits Program that ensured health services for survivors of the Tuskegee Study.}}\n\nBuxtun finally went to the press in the early 1970s. The story broke first in the ''[[Washington Star]]'' on July 25, 1972. It became front-page news in the ''[[New York Times]]'' the following day. Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] called [[Congressional hearings]], at which Buxtun and HEW officials testified. As a result of public outcry, the CDC and PHS appointed an ''[[ad hoc]]'' advisory panel to review the study. The panel found that the men agreed to certain terms of the experiment, such as examination and treatment. However, they were not informed of the study's actual purpose.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> The panel then determined the study was medically unjustified and ordered its termination.\n\nAs part of the settlement of a [[class action lawsuit]] subsequently filed by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] on behalf of study participants and their descendants, the U.S. government paid $10 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1974}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and to surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study; Congress created a commission empowered to write regulations to deter such abuses from occurring in the future.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nA collection of materials compiled to investigate the study is held at the [[National Library of Medicine]] in Bethesda, Maryland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/tuskegee264|title=Documents on the origin and development of the Tuskegee syphilis study 1921-1973|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 1974 Congress passed the [[National Research Act]] and created a [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research|commission]] to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials. Now studies require [[informed consent]],<ref name=\"hhs.gov\"/> communication of [[diagnosis]] and accurate reporting of test results.<ref name=\"hsl.virginia.edu\"/> Institutional review boards (IRBs), including laypeople, are established in scientific research groups and hospitals to review study protocols and protect patient interests, to ensure that participants are fully informed.\n\nIn 1994, a multi-disciplinary symposium was held on the Tuskegee study: ''Doing Bad in the Name of Good?: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Its Legacy'' at the [[University of Virginia]]. Following that, interested parties formed the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee to develop ideas that had arisen at the symposium. It issued its final report in May 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/badblood/ |title= Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study | publisher = University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.| accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The Committee had two related goals: (1) President [[Bill Clinton]] should publicly apologize for past government wrongdoing related to the study and (2) the Committee and relevant federal agencies should develop a strategy to redress the damages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/badblood/report/ |title= Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study: Final Report of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | publisher = University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.| accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA year later on May 16, 1997, Bill Clinton formally apologized and held a ceremony at the White House for surviving Tuskegee study participants. He said:\n\n<blockquote>What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry... To our African American citizens, I am sorry that your federal government orchestrated a study so clearly racist.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html\n|title=Remarks by the President in apology for study done in Tuskegee\n|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House\n|date=May 16, 1997\n|accessdate=September 6, 2009\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090548/http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html\n|archive-date=October 11, 2014\n|url-status=dead\n|df=mdy-all\n}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nFive of the eight study survivors attended the White House ceremony.\n\nThe presidential apology led to progress in addressing the second goal of the Legacy Committee.

The film's ending introduced [[Akshay Kumar]] as ATS chief Veer Sooryavanshi, Singham's acquaintance. A second spin-off, ''[[Sooryavanshi]]'', is slated for release in 2020, and will have Kumar reprise the role in the lead, with both Devgn and Singh reprising their respective characters Singham and Simmba in an important climactic sequence.\n\n== Plot ==\nBajirao Singham ([[Ajay Devgn]]) who is now a [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]], gets transferred to Mumbai and discovers that one of his team members, Mahesh, is found dead inside an ambulance with massive bags of money. Singham decides to unearth the truth behind it and in this process, he collides with a powerful and fraudulent religious leader, Satyaraj Chandar a.k.a. Babaji ([[Amole Gupte]]), who has high-profile connections with corrupt politicians, including the ruling party's leader Guruji's ([[Anupam Kher]]) secretary minister Prakash Rao ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]).\n\nDuring this period, Guruji is killed by Babaji's henchmen due to Guruji's opposition to Rao's scheme, even though Singham was present at the scene. He vows revenge. Because of this, he has to pretend that he has resigned in front of his family. Due to this, his father asks him and his childhood friend, Avni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), to come to their home town, Shivgarh. After some time, Singham and Avni fall in love with each other. However, it is then revealed that Singham hasn't resigned and came to Shivgarh on a mission to get some evidence against Babaji.\n\nWhen they get back to Mumbai, Babaji starts threatening Singham's family. On the other hand, Rao harms all of Guruji's candidates, including Avni, because her brother is one of the candidates. Singham manages to save everyone but before they resign, one of Babaji's henchmen, Altaf ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), wakes up from a coma and testifies against him. Singham arrests Babaji and Rao. However, some party workers execute an attack outside the court, [[homicide|killing the witnesses]]. This causes Babaji and Rao to go scot free. But after Babaji gets released, Singham and a team of police force goes to his house without wearing their police uniforms and engage with Babaji and Rao's men and subsequently [[police brutality|torture]] them and the wounded Rao and Baba tell the truth.\n\nA few weeks later, Guruji's party wins the elections. While being transported to jail in a van, Rao and Baba once again threaten and taunt Singham. Suddenly, the van stops and the driver walks away. A water tanker crashes into the van and both of them are killed. Inspector Phadnavis (Vineet Sharma) tells the media that there was a brake failure, and the incident is deemed as an accident (a plan that was fabricated by Singham which resembled the way officer Mahesh was killed).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] Bajirao Singham\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]] as Avni Kamat\n* [[Amole Gupte]] as Satyaraj Chandra Baba\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Gurukant \"Guruji\" Acharya\n* [[Dayanand Shetty]] as Senior-Inspector Daya\n* Vineet Sharma as Sub-Inspector Phadnis\n* [[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]] as Minister Prakash Rao\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Chief Minister Vikram Adhikari\n* [[Sonalee Kulkarni]] as Maneka\n* [[Jitendra Joshi]] as Ashish (Maneka's boyfriend)\n* [[Sameer Dharmadhikari]] as Kishore Kamat\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Sunil Prabhat\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as [[Commissioner of Police, Delhi|Commissioner]] Rathore\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Reporter Meera Shorri\n* [[Govind Namdev]] as Manikrao Singham\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Altaf\n* [[Sachin Nayak]] as Bhola\n* [[Shriswara]] as Neeta Parmar\n* Ganesh Yadav as Mahesh\n* [[Sarita Joshi]] as Mrs. Jadhav\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirector Rohit Shetty announced his thoughts on making a sequel to one of his finest movies ''Singham'' (2011).

The film's ending introduced [[Akshay Kumar]] as ATS chief Veer Sooryavanshi, Singham's acquaintance. A second spin-off, ''[[Sooryavanshi]]'', is slated for release in 2020, and will have Kumar reprise the role in the lead, with both Devgn and Singh reprising their respective characters Singham and Simmba in an important climactic sequence.\n\n== Plot ==\nBajirao Singham ([[Ajay Devgn]]) who is now a [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]], gets transferred to Mumbai and discovers that one of his team members, Mahesh, is found dead inside an ambulance with massive bags of money. Singham decides to unearth the truth behind it and in this process, he collides with a powerful and fraudulent religious leader, Satyaraj Chandar a.k.a. Babaji ([[Amole Gupte]]), who has high-profile connections with corrupt politicians, including the ruling party's leader Guruji's ([[Anupam Kher]]) secretary minister Prakash Rao ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]).\n\nDuring this period, Guruji is killed by Babaji's henchmen due to Guruji's opposition to Rao's scheme, even though Singham was present at the scene. He vows revenge. Because of this, he has to pretend that he has resigned in front of his family. Due to this, his father asks him and his childhood friend, Avni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), to come to their home town, Shivgarh. After some time, Singham and Avni fall in love with each other. However, it is then revealed that Singham hasn't resigned and came to Shivgarh on a mission to get some evidence against Babaji.\n\nWhen they get back to Mumbai, Babaji starts threatening Singham's family. On the other hand, Rao harms all of Guruji's candidates, including Avni, because her brother is one of the candidates. Singham manages to save everyone but before they resign, one of Babaji's henchmen, Altaf ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), wakes up from a coma and testifies against him. Singham arrests Babaji and Rao. However, some party workers execute an attack outside the court, [[homicide|killing the witnesses]]. This causes Babaji and Rao to go scot free. But after Babaji gets released, Singham and a team of police force goes to his house without wearing their police uniforms and engage with Babaji and Rao's men and subsequently [[police brutality|torture]] them and the wounded Rao and Baba tell the truth.\n\nA few weeks later, Guruji's party wins the elections. While being transported to jail in a van, Rao and Baba once again threaten and taunt Singham. Suddenly, the van stops and the driver walks away. A water tanker crashes into the van and both of them are killed. Inspector Phadnavis (Vineet Sharma) tells the media that there was a brake failure, and the incident is deemed as an accident (a plan that was fabricated by Singham which resembled the way officer Mahesh was killed).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Deputy Commissioner of Police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] Bajirao Singham\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]] as Avni Kamat\n* [[Amole Gupte]] as Satyaraj Chandra Baba\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Gurukant \"Guruji\" Acharya\n* [[Dayanand Shetty]] as Senior-Inspector Daya\n* Vineet Sharma as Sub-Inspector Phadnis\n* [[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]] as Minister Prakash Rao\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Chief Minister Vikram Adhikari\n* [[Sonalee Kulkarni]] as Maneka\n* [[Jitendra Joshi]] as Ashish (Maneka's boyfriend)\n* [[Sameer Dharmadhikari]] as Kishore Kamat\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Sunil Prabhat\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as [[Commissioner of Police, Delhi|Commissioner]] Rathore\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Reporter Meera Shorri\n* [[Govind Namdev]] as Manikrao Singham\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Altaf\n* [[Sachin Nayak]] as Bhola\n* [[Shriswara]] as Neeta Parmar\n* Ganesh Yadav as Mahesh\n* [[Sarita Joshi]] as Mrs. Jadhav\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Filming ===\nDirector Rohit Shetty announced his thoughts on making a sequel to one of his finest movies ''Singham'' (2011).

X was a new type of robot with the ability to make his own decisions. Recognizing the potential danger of this model, Light sealed X away in a diagnostic capsule for over 30 years of testing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mega Man X|url=http://cheats.ign.com/objects/006/006872.html|publisher=IGN|work=|accessdate=2012-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414120538/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/006/006872.html|archive-date=2012-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though what happened to him during these years is not specifically mentioned, it is assumed that Dr. Light died and left his diagnostic experiments unfinished. X's capsule was uncovered by an archaeologist named [[Dr. Cain]] almost 100 years after X's creation. Excited by the possibilities X presented, Cain disregarded the warnings Light had logged in the capsule and created a legion of new robots that replicated X's [[free will]]; these robots were called \"Reploids\" (shortened from Replica Android).\n\nHowever, a virus that caused Reploids to turn against humans (later discovered to be originated by [[Dr. Wily]], and implanted in Zero) began to spread. These Reploids were dubbed \"Mavericks\" (\"Irregulars\" in Japan), and a force called the Maverick Hunters (\"Irregular Hunters\") was formed to combat them. The Maverick Hunters were led by Sigma until he, too, became a Maverick and declared war against the humans, thus starting the Maverick War. X took it upon himself to join the Maverick Hunters under the new leader [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]], on a mission to save Earth from Sigma. Throughout the series, X, Zero, and later Axl\u2014a prototype of the next-generation Reploid\u2014battle against Sigma and his Maverick followers to stop their many diabolical plots to destroy the human race.\n\n==Series history==\n\nCapcom released ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'' for the SNES to give a new image to the ''Mega Man'' game series. There are a total of 11 games in the ''Mega Man X'' series: ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'' through ''[[Mega Man X8]]'', ''[[Mega Man X: Command Mission]]'', ''[[Mega Man Xtreme]] and [[Mega Man Xtreme 2|Xtreme 2]]''. The ''[[Mega Man X Collection]]'' was later released in 2006 exclusively in North America, which comprised the first six ''Mega Man X'' games, plus ''[[Mega Man Battle & Chase|Mega Man: Battle & Chase]]''. Two new collection sets were released as a combo pack worldwide are ''Mega Man X Legacy Collection'' which have ''Mega Man X'' through ''[[Mega Man X4]]'', and ''Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2'' which have ''[[Mega Man X5]]'' through ''Mega Man X8'' and were released in July 2018, with the Japanese release occurring two days after the rest of the world.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:35%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Release date\n! style=\"width:10%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Platform\n! style=\"width:47%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n|-\n!

However, it was cancelled by Capcom after six months of development.<ref>{{cite web|last=McWhertor |first=Michael |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/9/4179628/mega-man-fps-maverick-hunter |title=Maverick Hunter: The Mega Man first-person shooter that could have been |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mega Man X'' plays similarly to its predecessor series ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'', but with various new features: X has, by default beginning with ''X2'', the ability to dash along the ground at any time (which is very similar to the original slide move from the original, but with better accurate controlling), cling to walls and Wall Jump, and dash and jump at the same time, increasing his speed in the air. This all gives X more mobility than his Classic counterpart; these modifications make it easier to go through the majority of the game without using any other gun than the default, which is different from previous ''Mega Man'' games where players were more inclined to rely on weapons won in previous fights (like Metal Man's infamous Metal Blades) against boss characters in previously conquered stages.\n\nX is also able to locate capsules that permanently upgrade a part of his armor, such as his helmet, boots, chestplate, or arm cannon. An upgrade common to each game is the ability for X to charge weapons earned from bosses, which gives them an enhanced secondary fire mode. In later games, there are multiple armor types available that can either be mixed and matched, or completed for additional armor set bonuses.\n\nIn ''X3'', Zero (the leader of the Maverick Hunters in the first Mega Man X) is a playable character from the beginning. In ''X3'', Zero is armed with a beam saber in addition to the traditional \"buster\" gun, but relies on his saber almost exclusively starting in ''X4''. In ''X5'', both X and Zero gained the ability to duck; an ability previously unavailable. In ''X6'', there is a new rescue system where the player must rescue reploids. In ''X7'', a new character known as Axl is introduced, playable alongside X and Zero. Axl utilizes two guns known as Axl Bullets. In ''X8'', the latest entry in the franchise, a new Double Attack feature is introduced, where two characters can attack at the same time.\n\nMavericks replace the Robot Masters, and Sigma replaces Dr. Wily. The stage boss Mavericks are based on various types of [[organism]]s (usually [[animal]]s) instead of being humanoid in appearance, as were most of the bosses in the classic series, although their attacks and names are usually based on mechanical or chemical phenomena or laws of physics like the original games.

X was a new type of robot with the ability to make his own decisions. Recognizing the potential danger of this model, Light sealed X away in a diagnostic capsule for over 30 years of testing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mega Man X|url=http://cheats.ign.com/objects/006/006872.html|publisher=IGN|work=|accessdate=2012-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414120538/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/006/006872.html|archive-date=2012-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though what happened to him during these years is not specifically mentioned, it is assumed that Dr. Light died and left his diagnostic experiments unfinished. X's capsule was uncovered by an archaeologist named [[Dr. Cain]] almost 100 years after X's creation. Excited by the possibilities X presented, Cain disregarded the warnings Light had logged in the capsule and created a legion of new robots that replicated X's [[free will]]; these robots were called \"Reploids\" (shortened from Replica Android).\n\nHowever, a virus that caused Reploids to turn against humans (later discovered to be originated by [[Dr. Wily]], and implanted in Zero) began to spread. These Reploids were dubbed \"Mavericks\" (\"Irregulars\" in Japan), and a force called the Maverick Hunters (\"Irregular Hunters\") was formed to combat them. The Maverick Hunters were led by Sigma until he, too, became a Maverick and declared war against the humans, thus starting the Maverick War. X took it upon himself to join the Maverick Hunters under the new leader [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]], on a mission to save Earth from Sigma. Throughout the series, X, Zero, and later Axl\u2014a prototype of the next-generation Reploid\u2014battle against Sigma and his Maverick followers to stop their many diabolical plots to destroy the human race.\n\n==Series history==\n\nCapcom released ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'' for the SNES to give a new image to the ''Mega Man'' game series. There are a total of 11 games in the ''Mega Man X'' series: ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'' through ''[[Mega Man X8]]'', ''[[Mega Man X: Command Mission]]'', ''[[Mega Man Xtreme]] and [[Mega Man Xtreme 2|Xtreme 2]]''. The ''[[Mega Man X Collection]]'' was later released in 2006 exclusively in North America, which comprised the first six ''Mega Man X'' games, plus ''[[Mega Man Battle & Chase|Mega Man: Battle & Chase]]''. Two new collection sets were released as a combo pack worldwide are ''Mega Man X Legacy Collection'' which have ''Mega Man X'' through ''[[Mega Man X4]]'', and ''Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2'' which have ''[[Mega Man X5]]'' through ''Mega Man X8'' and were released in July 2018, with the Japanese release occurring two days after the rest of the world.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:35%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Release date\n! style=\"width:10%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Platform\n! style=\"width:47%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n|-\n!

However, it was cancelled by Capcom after six months of development.<ref>{{cite web|last=McWhertor |first=Michael |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/9/4179628/mega-man-fps-maverick-hunter |title=Maverick Hunter: The Mega Man first-person shooter that could have been |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mega Man X'' plays similarly to its predecessor series ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'', but with various new features: X has, by default beginning with ''X2'', the ability to dash along the ground at any time (which is very similar to the original slide move from the original, but with better accurate controlling), cling to walls and Wall Jump, and dash and jump at the same time, increasing his speed in the air. This all gives X more mobility than his Classic counterpart; these modifications make it easier to go through the majority of the game without using any other gun than the default, which is different from previous ''Mega Man'' games where players were more inclined to rely on weapons won in previous fights (like Metal Man's infamous Metal Blades) against boss characters in previously conquered stages.\n\nX is also able to locate capsules that permanently upgrade a part of his armor, such as his helmet, boots, chestplate, or arm cannon. An upgrade common to each game is the ability for X to charge weapons earned from bosses, which gives them an enhanced secondary fire mode. In later games, there are multiple armor types available that can either be mixed and matched, or completed for additional armor set bonuses.\n\nIn ''X3'', Zero (the leader of the Maverick Hunters in the first Mega Man X) is a playable character from the beginning. In ''X3'', Zero is armed with a beam saber in addition to the traditional \"buster\" gun, but relies on his saber almost exclusively starting in ''X4''. In ''X5'', both X and Zero gained the ability to duck; an ability previously unavailable. In ''X6'', there is a new rescue system where the player must rescue reploids. In ''X7'', a new character known as Axl is introduced, playable alongside X and Zero. Axl utilizes two guns known as Axl Bullets. In ''X8'', the latest entry in the franchise, a new Double Attack feature is introduced, where two characters can attack at the same time.\n\nMavericks replace the Robot Masters, and Sigma replaces Dr. Wily. The stage boss Mavericks are based on various types of [[organism]]s (usually [[animal]]s) instead of being humanoid in appearance, as were most of the bosses in the classic series, although their attacks and names are usually based on mechanical or chemical phenomena or laws of physics like the original games. The exception to this usually applies to the main group of antagonists in each game, which are normally humanoid in appearance. Repliforce is an example of humanlike antagonists, who appear in ''[[Mega Man X4]]''.\n\n==Other media==\n===Animation===\nThe popularity of the series prompted a crossover into the ''[[Mega Man (1994 TV series)|Mega Man]]'' cartoon from [[Ruby-Spears]], in which X travels back in time in pursuit of several Mavericks and teams up with the original Mega Man.\n\n===Print===\nThe storylines of several of the X series games were adapted into manga form.\n\n[[Archie Comics]] included characters and elements of the X series in its [[Mega Man (Archie Comics)|''Mega Man'' comic]], beginning with the adaptation \"The X Factor\" and continuing in an original story titled \"Dawn of X\" that switched back and forth between X's timeline and that of the original Mega Man during the early stages of the ''[[Mega Man 3]]'' adaptation. Shortly thereafter, the series would be incorporated in the series' second crossover with the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic lines from Archie, ''Worlds Unite''. The plot of this crossover centers around Sigma forming an alliance with various other villains-including the Deadly Six from ''[[Sonic Lost World]]''-from different dimensions in a bid to take control of the multiverse. This prompts the Maverick Hunters-whose membership includes X, Zero, and Axl due to the story being set between the events of X7 and X8-to join forces with Mega Man and the Robot Masters-shortly after the conclusion of the ''Mega Man 3'' adaptation-and other heroes, including [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his various allies. The crossover includes not only the classic Mega Man, Mega Man X and the new Sonic series ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'', but also includes various other Capcom and [[Sega]] video game properties. These included-but are not limited to-''[[\u014ckami]]'', ''[[Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg]]'', ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', ''[[Nights into Dreams...]]'', ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'', and ''[[Alex Kidd]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mega Man X}}\n{{Mega Man series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mega Man X Series}}\n[[Category:Action video games]]\n[[Category:Capcom franchises]]\n[[Category:Mega Man X|*]]\n[[Category:Science fiction video games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling platform games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling video games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993]]\n", "name_user": "Liaon98", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSeries history", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X"}
